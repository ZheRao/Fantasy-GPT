Empire of Storms


NIGHTFALL 


The bone drums had been pounding across the jagged slopes of the Black 
Mountains since sundown. 

From the rocky outcropping on which her war tent groaned against the 
dry wind, Princess Elena Galathynius had monitored the dread-lord's army 
all afternoon as it washed across those mountains in ebony waves. And now 
that the sun had long since vanished, the enemy campfires flickered across 
the mountains and valley below like a blanket of stars. 

So many fires--so many, compared to those burning on her side of the 
valley. 

She did not need the gift of her Fae ears to hear the prayers of her 
human army, both spoken and silent. She'd offered up several herself in the 
past few hours, though she knew they would go unanswered. 

Elena had never considered where she might die--never considered that 
it might be so far from the rocky green of Terrasen. That her body might not 
be burned, but devoured by the dread-lord's beasts. 

There would be no marker to tell the world where a Princess of Terrasen 
had fallen. There would be no marker for any of them. 

"You need rest," a rough male voice said from the tent entrance behind 
her. 

Elena looked over her shoulder, her unbound silver hair snagging on the 
intricate leather scales of her armor. But Gavin's dark gaze was already on 
the two armies stretching below them. On that narrow black band of 
demarcation, too soon to be breached. 

For all his talk of rest, Gavin hadn't removed his own armor upon 
entering their tent hours before. Only minutes ago had his war leaders 
finally shoved out of the tent, bearing maps in their hands and not a shred of 
hope in their hearts. She could scent it on them--the fear. The despair. 


Gavin's steps hardly crunched on the dry, rocky earth as he approached 
her lonely vigil, near-silent thanks to his years roaming the wilds of the 
South. Elena again faced those countless enemy fires. 

He said hoarsely, "Your father's forces could still make it." 

A fool's hope. Her immortal hearing had picked up every word of the 
hours of debate raging inside the tent behind them. "This valley is now a 
death trap," Elena said. 

And she had led them all here. 

Gavin did not answer. 

"Come dawn," Elena went on, "it will be bathed in blood." 

The war leader at her side remained silent. So rare for Gavin, that 
silence. Not a flicker of that untamed fierceness shone in his uptilted eyes, 
and his shaggy brown hair hung limp. She couldn't remember the last time 
either of them had bathed. 

Gavin turned to her with that frank assessment that had stripped her 
bare from the moment she'd first met him in her father's hall nearly a year 
ago. Lifetimes ago. 

Such a different time, a different world--when the lands had still been 
full of singing and light, when magic hadn't begun to flicker in the growing 
shadow of Erawan and his demon soldiers. She wondered how long Orynth 
would hold out once the slaughter here in the South had ended. Wondered if 
Erawan would first destroy her father's shining palace atop the mountain, or 
if he would burn the royal library--burn the heart and knowledge of an age. 
And then burn its people. 

"Dawn is yet hours away," said Gavin, his throat bobbing. "Time 
enough for you to make a run for it." 

"They'd tear us to shreds before we could clear the passes--" 

"Not us. You." The firelight cast his tan face in flickering relief. "You 
alone." 

"I will not abandon these people." Her fingers grazed his. "Or you." 

Gavin's face didn't stir. "There is no avoiding tomorrow. Or the 
bloodshed. You overheard what the messenger said--I know you did. 
Anielle is a slaughterhouse. Our allies from the North are gone. Your 
father's army is too far behind. We will all die before the sun is fully risen." 

"We'll all die one day anyway." 


"No." Gavin squeezed her hand. "I will die. Those people down there-- 
they will die. Either by sword or time. But you..." His gaze flicked to her 
delicately pointed ears, the heritage of her father. "You could live for 
centuries. Millennia. Do not throw it away for a doomed battle." 

"I would sooner die tomorrow than live for a thousand years with a 
coward's shame." 

But Gavin stared across the valley again. At his people, the last line of 
defense against Erawan's horde. 

"Get behind your father's lines," he said roughly, "and continue the 
fight from there." 

She swallowed hard. "It would be no use." 

Slowly, Gavin looked at her. And after all these months, all this time, 
she confessed, "My father's power is failing. He is close--decades now-- 
from the fading. Mala's light dims inside him with every passing day. He 
cannot stand against Erawan and win." Her father's last words before she'd 
set out on this doomed quest months ago: My sun is setting, Elena. You must 
find a way to ensure yours still rises. 

Gavin's face leeched of color. "You choose now to tell me this?" 

"I choose now, Gavin, because there is no hope for me, either--whether 
I flee tonight or fight tomorrow. The continent will fall." 

Gavin shifted toward the dozen tents on the outcropping. His friends. 

Her friends. 

"None of us are walking away tomorrow," he said. 

And it was the way his words broke, the way his eyes shone, that had 
her reaching for his hand once more. Never--not once in all their 
adventures, in all the horrors that they had endured together--had she seen 
him cry. 

"Erawan will win and rule this land, and all others, for eternity," Gavin 
whispered. 

Soldiers stirred in their camp below. Men and women, murmuring, 
swearing, weeping. Elena tracked the source of their terror--all the way 
across the valley. 

One by one, as if a great hand of darkness wiped them away, the fires of 
the dread-lord's camp went out. The bone drums beat louder. 

He had arrived at last. 

Erawan himself had come to oversee the final stand of Gavin's army. 


"They are not going to wait until dawn," Gavin said, a hand lurching to 
where Damaris was sheathed at his side. 

But Elena gripped his arm, the hard muscle like granite beneath his 
leather armor. 

Erawan had come. 

Perhaps the gods were still listening. Perhaps her mother's fiery soul 
had convinced them. 

She took in Gavin's harsh, wild face--the face that she had come to 
cherish above all others. And she said, "We are not going to win this battle. 
And we are not going to win this war." 

His body quivered with the restraint to keep from going to his war 
leaders, but he gave her the respect of listening. They'd both given each 
other that, had learned it the hard way. 

With her free hand, Elena lifted her fingers in the air between them. The 
raw magic in her veins now danced, from flame to water to curling vine to 
cracking ice. Not an endless abyss like her father's, but a versatile, nimble 
gift of magic. Granted by her mother. "We are not going to win this war," 
Elena repeated, Gavin's face aglow in the light of her uncut power. "But we 
can delay it a little while. I can get across that valley in an hour or two." 
She curled her fingers into a fist, and snuffed out her magic. 

Gavin's brows furrowed. "What you speak of is madness, Elena. 
Suicide. His lieutenants will catch you before you can even slip through the 
lines." 

"Exactly. They'll bring me right to him, now that he has come. They'll 
consider me his prized prisoner--not his assassin." 

"No." An order and a plea. 

"Kill Erawan, and his beasts will panic. Long enough for my father's 
forces to arrive, unite with whatever remains of ours, and crush the enemy 
legions." 

"You say 'kill Erawan' as if that is some easy task. He is a Valg king, 
Elena. Even if they bring you to him, he will leash you to his will before 
you can make a move." 

Her heart strained, but she forced the words out. "That is why..." She 
couldn't stop her wobbling lips. "That is why I need you to come with me 
instead of fight with your men." 

Gavin only stared at her. 


"Because I need..." Tears slid down her cheeks. "I need you as a 
distraction. I need you to buy me time to get past his inner defenses." Just 
as the battle tomorrow would buy them time. 

Because Erawan would go for Gavin first. The human warrior who had 
been a bastion against the Dark Lord's forces for so long, who had fought 
him when no other would ... Erawan's hatred for the human prince was 
rivaled only by his hatred for her father. 

Gavin studied her for a long moment, then reached to brush her tears 
away. "He cannot be killed, Elena. You heard what your father's oracle 
whispered." 

She nodded. "I know." 

"And even if we manage to contain him--trap him..." Gavin 
considered her words. "You know that we are only pushing the war onto 
someone else--to whoever one day rules these lands." 

"This war," she said quietly, "is but the second movement in a game that 
has been played since those ancient days across the sea." 

"We put it off for someone else to inherit if he's freed. And it will not 
save those soldiers down there from slaughter tomorrow." 

"If we do not act, there won't be anyone to inherit this war," Elena said. 
Doubt danced in Gavin's eyes. "Even now," she pushed, "our magic is 
failing, our gods abandoning us. Running from us. We have no Fae allies 
beyond those in my father's army. And their power, like his, is fading. But 
perhaps, when that third movement comes ... perhaps the players in our 
unfinished game will be different. Perhaps it will be a future in which Fae 
and humans fight side by side, ripe with power. Maybe they will find a way 
to end this. So we will lose this battle, Gavin," she said. "Our friends will 
die on that killing field come dawn, and we will use it as our distraction to 
contain Erawan so that Erilea might have a future." 

His lips tightened, his sapphire eyes wide. 

"No one must know," she said, her voice breaking. "Even if we succeed, 
no one must know what we do." 

Doubt etched deep lines into his face. She gripped his hand harder. "No 
one, Gavin." 

Agony rippled across his features. But he nodded. 

Hand in hand, they stared toward the darkness coating the mountains, 
the dread-lord's bone drums pounding like hammers on iron. Too soon, 





those drums would be drowned out by the screams of dying soldiers. Too 
soon, the valley fields would be carved with streams of blood. 

Gavin said, "If we are to do this, we need to leave now." His attention 
again snagged on the nearby tents. No good-byes. No last words. "PI give 
Holdren the order to lead tomorrow. He'll know what to tell the others." 

She nodded, and it was confirmation enough. Gavin released her hand, 
striding for the tent closest to their own, to where his dearest friend and 
most loyal war leader was likely making the best of his final hours with his 
new wife. 

Elena drew her eyes away before Gavin's broad shoulders pushed 
through the heavy flaps. 

She gazed over the fires, across the valley, to the darkness perched on 
the other side. She could have sworn it stared back, sworn she heard the 
thousand whetstones as the dread-lord's beasts sharpened their poison-slick 
claws. 

She lifted her eyes toward the smoke-stained sky, the plumes parting for 
a heartbeat to reveal a star-flecked night. 

The Lord of the North flickered down at her. Perhaps the final gift of 
Mala to these lands--in this age, at least. Perhaps a thank-you to Elena 
herself, and a farewell. 

Because for Terrasen, for Erilea, Elena would walk into the eternal 
darkness lurking across the valley to buy them all a chance. 

Elena sent up a final prayer on a pillar of smoke rising from the valley 
floor that the unborn, faraway scions of this night, heirs to a burden that 
would doom or save Erilea, would forgive her for what she was about to do. 


PART ONE 


THE FIRE-BRINGER 


Chapter 1 


Elide Lochan's breath scorched her throat with every gasping inhale as she 
limped up the steep forest hill. 

Beneath the soggy leaves coating Oakwald's floor, loose gray stones 
made the slope treacherous, the towering oaks stretching too high above for 
her to grip any branches should she tumble down. Braving the potential fall 
in favor of speed, Elide scrambled over the lip of the craggy summit, her 
leg twanging with pain as she slumped to her knees. 

Forested hills rolled away in every direction, the trees like the bars of a 
never-ending cage. 

Weeks. It had been weeks since Manon Blackbeak and the Thirteen had 
left her in this forest, the Wing Leader ordering her to head north. To find 
her lost queen, now grown and mighty--and to also find Celaena 
Sardothien, whoever she was, so that Elide might repay the life debt she 
owed to Kaltain Rompier. 

Even weeks later, her dreams were plagued by those final moments in 
Morath: the guards who had tried to drag her to be implanted with Valg 
offspring, the Wing Leader's complete massacre of them, and Kaltain 
Rompier's final act--carving the strange, dark stone from where it had been 
sewn into her arm and ordering Elide to take it to Celaena Sardothien. 

Right before Kaltain turned Morath into a smoldering ruin. 

Elide put a dirty, near-trembling hand to the hard lump tucked in the 
breast pocket of the flying leathers she still wore. She could have sworn a 
faint throbbing echoed into her skin, a counterbeat to her own racing heart. 

Elide shuddered in the watery sunlight trickling through the green 
canopy. Summer lay heavy over the world, the heat now oppressive enough 
that water had become her most precious commodity. 

It had been from the start--but now her entire day, her life, revolved 
around it. 


Fortunately, Oakwald was rife with streams after the last of the melted 
mountain snows had snaked from their peaks. Unfortunately, Elide had 
learned the hard way about what water to drink. 

Three days, she'd been near death with vomiting and fever after gulping 
down that stagnant pond water. Three days, she'd shivered so badly she 
thought her bones would crack apart. Three days, quietly weeping in pitiful 
despair that she'd die here, alone in this endless forest, and no one would 
ever know. 

And through it all, that stone in her breast pocket thrummed and 
throbbed. In her fevered dreams, she could have sworn it whispered to her, 
sang lullabies in languages that she did not think human tongues could utter. 

She hadn't heard it since, but she still wondered. Wondered if most 
humans would have died. 

Wondered whether she carried a gift or a curse northward. And if this 
Celaena Sardothien would know what to do with it. 

Tell her that you can open any door, if you have the key, Kaltain had 
said. Elide often studied the iridescent black stone whenever she halted for 
a needed break. It certainly didn't look like a key: rough-hewn, as if it had 
been cleaved from a larger chunk of stone. Perhaps Kaltain's words were a 
riddle meant only for its recipient. 

Elide unslung her too-light pack from her shoulders and yanked open 
the canvas flap. She'd run out of food a week ago and had taken to 
scavenging for berries. They were all foreign, but a whisper of a memory 
from her years with her nursemaid, Finnula, had warned her to rub them on 
her wrist first--to see if they raised any reaction. 

Most of the time, too much of the time, they did. 

But every now and then she'd stumble across a bush sagging with the 
right ones, and she'd gorge herself before filling her pack. Fishing inside 
the pink-and-blue-stained canvas interior, Elide dug out the last handful, 
wrapped in her spare shirt, the white fabric now a splotchy red and purple. 

One handful--to last until she found her next meal. 

Hunger gnawed at her, but Elide ate only half. Maybe she'd find more 
before she stopped for the night. 

She didn't know how to hunt--and the thought of catching another 
living thing, of snapping its neck or bashing in its skull with a rock ... She 
was not yet that desperate. 


Perhaps it made her not a Blackbeak after all, despite her mother's 
hidden bloodline. 

Elide licked her fingers clean of the berry juice, dirt and all, and hissed 
as she stood on stiff, sore legs. She wouldn't last long without food but 
couldn't risk venturing into a village with the money Manon had given her, 
or toward any of the hunters' fires she'd spotted these past few weeks. 

No--she had seen enough of the kindness and mercy of men. She would 
never forget how those guards had leered at her naked body, why her uncle 
had sold her to Duke Perrington. 

Wincing, Elide swung her pack over her shoulders and carefully set off 
down the hill's far slope, picking her way among the rocks and roots. 

Maybe she'd made a wrong turn. How would she know when she'd 
crossed Terrasen's border, anyway? 

And how would she ever find her queen--her court? 

Elide shoved the thoughts away, keeping to the murky shadows and 
avoiding the splotches of sunlight. It'd only make her thirstier, hotter. 

Find water, perhaps more important than finding berries, before 
darkness set in. 

She reached the foot of the hill, suppressing a groan at the labyrinth of 
wood and stone. 

It seemed she now stood in a dried streambed wending between the 
hills. It curved sharply ahead--northward. A sigh rattled out of her. Thank 
Anneith. At least the Lady of Wise Things had not abandoned her yet. 

She'd follow the streambed for as long as possible, staying northward, 
and then-- 

Elide didn't know what sense, exactly, picked up on it. Not smell or 
sight or sound, for nothing beyond the rot of the loam and the sunlight and 
stones and the whispering of the high-above leaves was out of the ordinary. 

But--there. Like some thread in a great tapestry had snagged, her body 
locked up. 

The humming and rustling of the forest went quiet a heartbeat later. 

Elide scanned the hills, the streambed. The roots of an oak atop the 
nearest hill jutted from the slope's grassy side, providing a thatch of wood 
and moss over the dead stream. Perfect. 

She limped for it, ruined leg barking, stones clattering and wrenching at 
her ankles. She could nearly touch the tips of the roots when the first 


hollowed-out boom echoed. 

Not thunder. No, she would never forget this one particular sound--for 
it, too, haunted her dreams both awake and asleep. 

The beating of mighty, leathery wings. Wyverns. 

And perhaps more deadly: the Ironteeth witches who rode them, senses 
as sharp and fine-tuned as their mounts'. 

Elide lunged for the overhang of thick roots as the wing beats neared, 
the forest silent as a graveyard. Stones and sticks ripped at her bare hands, 
her knees banging on the rocky dirt as she pressed herself into the hillside 
and peered at the canopy through the latticework of roots. 

One beat--then another not even a heartbeat after. Synced enough that 
anyone in the forest might think it was only an echo, but Elide knew: two 
witches. 

She'd picked up enough in her time in Morath to know the Ironteeth 
were under orders to keep their numbers hidden. They'd fly in perfect, 
mirrored formation, so listening ears might only report one wyvern. 

But these two, whoever they were, were sloppy. Or as sloppy as one of 
the immortal, lethal witches could be. Lower-level coven members, 
perhaps. Out on a scouting mission. 

Or hunting for someone, a small, petrified voice whispered in her head. 

Elide pressed harder into the soil, roots digging into her back as she 
monitored the canopy. 

And there. The blur of a swift-moving, massive shape gliding right 
above the canopy, rattling the leaves. A leathery, membranous wing, its 
edge tipped in a curved, poison-slick talon, flashed in the sunlight. 

Rarely--so rarely--were they ever out in daylight. Whatever they 
hunted--it had to be important. 

Elide didn't dare breathe too loudly until those wing beats faded, sailing 
due north. 

Toward the Ferian Gap--where Manon had mentioned the second half 
of the host was camped. 

Elide only moved when the forest's buzzing and chittering resumed. 
Staying still for so long had caused her muscles to cramp, and she groaned 
as she stretched out her legs, then her arms, then rolled her shoulders. 

Endless--this journey was endless. She'd give anything for a safe roof 
over her head. And a hot meal. Maybe seeking them out, if only for a night, 


was worth the risk. 

Picking her way along the bone-dry streambed, Elide made it two steps 
before that sense-that-was-not-a-sense twanged again, as if a warm, female 
hand had gripped her shoulder to stop. 

The tangled wood murmured with life. But she could feel it--feel 
something out there. 

Not witches or wyverns or beasts. But someone--someone was 
watching her. 

Someone was following her. 

Elide casually unsheathed the fighting knife Manon had given her upon 
leaving this miserable forest. 

She wished the witch had taught her how to kill. 


Lorcan Salvaterre had been running from those gods-damned beasts for two 
days now. 

He didn't blame them. The witches had been pissed when he'd snuck 
into their forest camp in the dead of night, slaughtered three of their 
sentinels without them or their mounts noticing, and dragged a fourth into 
the trees for questioning. 

It had taken him two hours to get the Yellowlegs witch to break, hidden 
so deep down the throat of a cave that even her screams had been contained. 
Two hours, and then she was singing for him. 

Twin witch armies now stood poised to take the continent: one in 
Morath, one in the Ferian Gap. The Yellowlegs knew nothing of what 
power Duke Perrington wielded--knew nothing of what Lorcan hunted: the 
other two Wyrdkeys, the siblings to the one he wore on a long chain around 
his neck. Three slivers of stone cleaved from an unholy Wyrdgate, each key 
capable of tremendous and terrible power. And when all three Wyrdkeys 
were united ... they could open that gate between worlds. Destroy those 
worlds--or summon their armies. And far, far worse. 

Lorcan had granted the witch the gift of a swift death. 

Her sisters had been hunting him since. 

Crouched in a thicket tucked into the side of a steep slope, Lorcan 
watched the girl ease from the roots. He'd been hiding here first, listening 


to the clamor of her clumsy approach, and had watched her stumble and 
limp when she finally heard what swept toward them. 

She was delicately built, small enough that he might have thought her 
barely past her first bleed were it not for the full breasts beneath her close- 
fitting leathers. 

Those clothes had snared his interest immediately. The Yellowlegs had 
been wearing similar ones--all the witches had. Yet this girl was human. 

And when she turned in his direction, those dark eyes scanned the forest 
with an assessment that was too old, too practiced, to belong to a child. At 
least eighteen--maybe older. Her pale face was dirty, gaunt. She'd likely 
been out here for a while, struggling to find food. And the knife she palmed 
shook enough to suggest she likely had no idea what to do with it. 

Lorcan remained hidden, watching her scan the hills, the stream, the 
canopy. 

She knew he was out there, somehow. 

Interesting. When he wanted to stay hidden, few could find him. 

Every muscle in her body was tense--but she finished scanning the 
gully, forcing a soft breath through her pursed lips, and continued on. Away 
from him. 

Each step was limping; she'd likely hurt herself crashing through the 
trees. 

The length of her braid snapped against her pack, her silky hair dark 
like his own. Darker. Black as a starless night. 

The wind shifted, blowing her scent toward him, and Lorcan breathed it 
in, allowing his Fae senses--the senses he'd inherited from his prick of a 
father--to assess, analyze, as they had done for over five centuries. 

Human. Definitely human, but-- 

He knew that scent. 

During the past few months, he'd slaughtered many, many creatures 
who bore its reek. 

Well, wasn't this convenient. Perhaps a gift from the gods: someone 
useful to interrogate. But later--once he had a chance to study her. Learn 
her weaknesses. 

Lorcan eased from the thicket, not even a twig rustling at his passing. 

The demon-possessed girl limped up the streambed, that useless knife 
still out, her grip on its hilt wholly ineffective. Good. 


And so Lorcan began his hunt. 


Chapter 2 


The patter of rain trickling through the leaves and low-lying mists of 
Oakwald Forest nearly drowned out the gurgle of the swollen stream cutting 
between the bumps and hollows. 

Crouched beside the brook, empty skins forgotten on the mossy bank, 
Aelin Ashryver Galathynius extended a scarred hand over the rushing water 
and let the song of the early-morning storm wash over her. 

The groaning of breaking thunderheads and the sear of answering 
lightning had been a violent, frenzied beat since the hour before dawn-- 
now spreading farther apart, calming their fury, as Aelin soothed her own 
burning core of magic. 

She breathed in the chill mists and fresh rain, dragging them deep into 
her lungs. Her magic guttered in answer, as if yawning good morning and 
tumbling back to sleep. 

Indeed, around the camp just within view, her companions still slept, 
protected from the storm by an invisible shield of Rowan's making, and 
warmed from the northern chill that persisted even in the height of summer 
by a merry ruby flame that she'd kept burning all night. It was the flame 
that had been the difficult thing to work around--how to keep it crackling 
while also summoning the small gift of water her mother had given her. 

Aelin flexed her fingers over the stream. 

Across the brook, atop a mossy boulder tucked into the arms of a 
gnarled oak, a pair of tiny bone-white fingers flexed and cracked, a mirror 
to her own movements. 

Aelin smiled and said so quietly it was barely audible over the stream 
and rain, "If you have any pointers, friend, I'd love to hear them." 

The spindly fingers darted back over the crest of the rock--which, like 
so many in these woods, had been carved with symbols and whorls. 


The Little Folk had been tracking them since they crossed the border 
into Terrasen. Escorting, Aedion had insisted whenever they spotted large, 
depthless eyes blinking from a tangle of brambles or peering through a 
cluster of leaves atop one of Oakwald's famed trees. They hadn't come 
close enough for Aelin to even get a solid look at them. 

But they'd left small gifts just outside the border of Rowan's nightly 
shields, somehow deposited without alerting whichever of them was on 
watch. 

One morning, it had been a crown of forest violets. Aelin had given it to 
Evangeline, who had worn the crown on her red-gold head until it fell apart. 
The next morning, two crowns waited: one for Aelin, and a smaller one for 
the scarred girl. Another day, the Little Folk left a replica of Rowan's hawk 
form, crafted from gathered sparrow feathers, acorns, and beetle husks. Her 
Fae Prince had smiled a bit when he'd found it--and carried it in his 
saddlebag since. 

Aelin herself smiled at the memory. Though knowing the Little Folk 
were following their every step, listening and watching, had made things ... 
difficult. Not in any real way that mattered, but slipping off into the trees 
with Rowan was certainly less romantic knowing they had an audience. 
Especially whenever Aedion and Lysandra got so sick of their silent, heated 
glances that the two made up flimsy excuses to get Aelin and Rowan out of 
sight and scent for a while: the lady had dropped her nonexistent 
handkerchief on the nonexistent path far behind; they needed more logs for 
a fire that did not require wood to burn. 

And as for her current audience... 

Aelin splayed her fingers over the stream, letting her heart become as 
still as a sun-warmed forest pool, letting her mind shake free of its normal 
boundaries. 

A ribbon of water fluttered up from the stream, gray and clear, and she 
wended it through her spread fingers as if she were threading a loom. 

She tilted her wrist, admiring the way she could see her skin through the 
water, letting it slip down her hand and curl about her wrist. She said to the 
faerie watching from the other side of the boulder, "Not much to report to 
your companions, is it?" 

Soggy leaves crunched behind her, and Aelin knew it was only because 
Rowan wanted her to hear his approach. "Careful, or they'll leave 


something wet and cold in your bedroll next time." 

Aelin made herself release the water into the stream before she looked 
over a shoulder. "Do you think they take requests? Because I'd hand over 
my kingdom for a hot bath right about now." 

Rowan's eyes danced as she eased to her feet. She lowered the shield 
she'd put around herself to keep dry--the steam off the invisible flame 
blending with the mist around them. The Fae Prince lifted a brow. "Should I 
be concerned that you're so chatty this early in the morning?" 

She rolled her eyes and turned toward the rock where the faerie had 
been monitoring her shoddy attempts to master water. But only rain-slick 
leaves and snaking mist remained. 

Strong hands slid over her waist, tugging her into his warmth, as 
Rowan's lips grazed her neck, right under her ear. 

Aelin arched back into him while his mouth roved across her throat, 
heating mist-chilled skin. "Good morning to you," she breathed. 

Rowan's responding grumble set her toes curling. 

They hadn't dared stop at an inn, even after crossing into Terrasen three 
days ago, not when there were still so many enemy eyes fixed on the roads 
and taprooms. Not when there were still streaming lines of Adarlanian 
soldiers finally marching out of her gods-damned territory--thanks to 
Dorian's decrees. 

Especially when those soldiers might very well march right back here, 
might choose to ally themselves with the monster squatting down in Morath 
rather than their true king. 

"If you want to take a bath so badly," Rowan murmured against her 
neck, "I spotted a pool about a quarter mile back. You could heat it--for 
both of us." 

She ran her nails down the back of his hands, up his forearms. "I'd boil 
all the fish and frogs inside it. I doubt it'd be very pleasant then." 

"At least we'd have breakfast prepared." 

She laughed under her breath, and Rowan's canines scratched the 
sensitive spot where her neck met her shoulder. Aelin dug her fingers into 
the powerful muscles of his forearms, savoring the strength there. "The 
lords won't be here until sundown. We've got time." Her words were 
breathless, barely more than a whisper. 


Upon crossing the border, Aedion had sent messages to the few lords he 
trusted, coordinating the meeting that was to happen today--in this 
clearing, which Aedion himself had used for covert rebel meetings these 
long years. 

They'd arrived early to scope out the land, the pitfalls and advantages. 
Not a trace of any humans lingered: Aedion and the Bane had always 
ensured any evidence was wiped away from unfriendly eyes. Her cousin 
and his legendary legion had already done so much to ensure the safety of 
Terrasen this past decade. But they were still taking no risks, even with 
lords who had once been her uncle's banner men. 

"Tempting as it might be," Rowan said, nipping her ear in a way that 
made it hard to think, "I need to be on my way in an hour." To scout the 
land ahead for any threats. Featherlight kisses brushed over her jaw, her 
cheek. "And what I said still holds. I'm not taking you against a tree the 
first time." 

"It wouldn't be against a tree--it'd be in a pool." A dark laugh against 
her now-burning skin. It was an effort to keep from taking one of his hands 
and guiding it up to her breasts, to beg him to touch, take, taste. "You know, 
I'm starting to think you're a sadist." 

"Trust me, I don't find it easy, either." He tugged her a bit harder against 
him, letting her feel the evidence pushing with impressive demand against 
her backside. She nearly groaned at that, too. 

Then Rowan pulled away, and she frowned at the loss of his warmth, at 
the loss of those hands and that body and that mouth. She turned, finding 
his pine-green eyes pinned on her, and a thrill sparked through her blood 
brighter than any magic. 

But he said, "Why are you so coherent this early?" 

She stuck out her tongue. "I took over the watch for Aedion, since 
Lysandra and Fleetfoot were snoring loud enough to wake the dead." 
Rowan's mouth twitched upward, but Aelin shrugged. "I couldn't sleep 
anyway." 

His jaw tightened as he glanced to where the amulet was hidden beneath 
her shirt and the dark leather jacket atop it. "Is the Wyrdkey bothering 
you?" 

"No, it's not that." She'd taken to wearing the amulet after 
Evangeline had looted through her saddlebags and donned the necklace. 


They'd only discovered it because the child had returned from washing 
herself with the Amulet of Orynth proudly displayed over her traveling 
clothes. Thank the gods they'd been deep in Oakwald at the time, but-- 
Aelin wasn't taking any other chances. 

Especially since Lorcan still believed he had the real thing. 

They hadn't heard from the immortal warrior since he'd left Rifthold, 
and Aelin often wondered how far south he'd gotten--if he'd yet realized 
he bore a fake Wyrdkey within an equally fake Amulet of Orynth. If he'd 
discovered where the other two had been hidden by the King of Adarlan 
and Duke Perrington. 

Not Perrington--Erawan. 

A chill snaked down her back, as if the shadow of Morath had taken 
form behind her and run a clawed finger along her spine. 

"It's just ... this meeting," Aelin said, waving a hand. "Should we have 
done it in Orynth? Out in the woods like this just seems so ... cloak-and- 
dagger." 

Rowan's eyes again drifted toward the northern horizon. At least 
another week lay between them and the city--the once-glorious heart of her 
kingdom. Of this continent. And when they got there, it would be an 
endless stream of councils and preparations and decisions that only she 
could make. This meeting Aedion had arranged would just be the start of it. 

"Better to go into the city with established allies than to enter not 
knowing what you might find," Rowan said at last. He gave her a wry smile 
and aimed a pointed look at Goldryn, sheathed across her back, and the 
various knives strapped to her. "And besides: I thought 'cloak-and-dagger' 
was your middle name." 

She offered him a vulgar gesture in return. 

Aedion had been so careful with his messages while setting up the 
meeting--had selected this spot far from any possible casualties or spying 
eyes. And even though he trusted the lords, whom he'd familiarized her 
with these past weeks, Aedion still hadn't informed them how many 
traveled in their party--what their talents were. Just in case. 

No matter that Aelin was the bearer of a weapon capable of wiping out 
this entire valley, along with the gray Staghorn Mountains watching over it. 
And that was just her magic. 


Rowan played with a strand of her hair--grown almost to her breasts 
again. "You're worried because Erawan hasn't made a move yet." 

She sucked on a tooth. "What is he waiting for? Are we fools for 
expecting an invitation to march on him? Or is he letting us gather our 
strength, letting me return with Aedion to get the Bane and raise a larger 
army around it, only so he can savor our utter despair when we fail?" 

Rowan's fingers stilled in her hair. "You heard Aedion's messenger. 
That blast took out a good chunk of Morath. He might be rebuilding 
himself." 

"No one has claimed that blast as their doing. I don't trust it." 

"You trust nothing." 

She met his eyes. "I trust you." 

Rowan brushed a finger along her cheek. The rain turned heavy again, 
its soft patter the only sound for miles. 

Aelin lifted onto her toes. She felt Rowan's eyes on her the whole time, 
felt his body go still with predatory focus, as she kissed the corner of his 
mouth, the bow of his lips, the other corner. 

Soft, taunting kisses. Designed to see which one of them yielded first. 

Rowan did. 

With a sharp intake of breath, he gripped her hips, tugging her against 
him as he slanted his mouth over hers, deepening the kiss until her knees 
threatened to buckle. His tongue brushed hers--lazy, deft strokes that told 
her precisely what he was capable of doing elsewhere. 

Embers sparked in her blood, and the moss beneath them hissed as rain 
turned to steam. 

Aelin broke the kiss, breathing ragged, satisfied to find Rowan's own 
chest rising and falling in an uneven rhythm. So new--this thing between 
them was still so new, so ... raw. Utterly consuming. The desire was only 
the start of it. 

Rowan made her magic sing. And maybe that was the carranam bond 
between them, but ... her magic wanted to dance with his. And from the 
frost sparkling in his eyes, she knew his own demanded the same. 

Rowan leaned forward until they were brow-to-brow. "Soon," he 
promised, his voice rough and low. "Let's get somewhere safe--somewhere 
defensible." 





Because her safety always would come first. For him, keeping her 
protected, keeping her alive, would always come first. He'd learned it the 
hard way. 

Her heart strained, and she pulled back to lift a hand to his face. Rowan 
read the softness in her eyes, her body, and his own inherent fierceness 
slipped into a gentleness that so few would ever see. Her throat ached with 
the effort of keeping the words in. 

She'd been in love with him for a while now. Longer than she wanted to 
admit. 

She tried not to think about it, whether he felt the same. Those things-- 
those wishes--were at the bottom of a very, very long and bloody priority 
list. 

So Aelin kissed Rowan gently, his hands again locking around her hips. 

"Fireheart," he said onto her mouth. 

"Buzzard," she murmured onto his. 

Rowan laughed, the rumble echoing in her chest. 

From the camp, Evangeline's sweet voice chirped through the rain, "Is it 
time for breakfast?" 

Aelin snorted. Sure enough, Fleetfoot and Evangeline were now 
nudging at poor Lysandra, sprawled out as a ghost leopard by the immortal- 
burning fire. Aedion, across the fire, lay as unmoving as a boulder. 
Fleetfoot would likely leap on him next. 

"This cannot end well," Rowan muttered. 

Evangeline howled, "Fooooood!"' Fleetfoot's answering howl followed 
a heartbeat later. 

Then Lysandra's snarl rippled toward them, silencing girl and hound. 

Rowan laughed again--and Aelin thought she might never get sick of it, 
that laugh. That smile. 

"We should make breakfast," he said, turning toward the camp, "before 
Evangeline and Fleetfoot ransack the whole site." 

Aelin chuckled but glanced over her shoulder to the forest stretching 
toward the Staghorns. Toward the lords who were hopefully making their 
way southward--to decide how they would proceed with war ... and 
rebuilding their broken kingdom. 

When she looked back, Rowan was halfway to the camp, Evangeline's 
red-gold hair flashing as she bounded through the dripping trees, begging 


the prince for toast and eggs. 

Her family--and her kingdom. 

Two dreams long believed lost, she realized as the northern wind ruffled 
her hair. That she would do anything--ruin herself, sell herself--to protect. 

Aelin was about to head for the camp to spare Evangeline from 
Rowan's cooking when she noticed the object atop the boulder across the 
stream. 

She cleared the stream in one bound and carefully studied what the 
faerie had left. 

Fashioned with twigs, cobwebs, and fish scales, the tiny wyvern was 
unnervingly accurate, its wings spread wide and thorn-fanged mouth 
roaring. 

Aelin left the wyvern where it was, but her eyes shifted southward, 
toward the ancient flow of Oakwald, and Morath looming far beyond it. To 
Erawan reborn, waiting for her with his host of Ironteeth witches and Valg 
foot soldiers. 

And Aelin Galathynius, Queen of Terrasen, knew the time would soon 
come to prove just how much she'd bleed for Erilea. 


It was useful, Aedion Ashryver thought, to travel with two gifted magic- 
wielders. Especially during piss-poor weather. 

The rains lingered throughout the day as they prepared for the meeting. 
Rowan had flown northward twice now to track the progress of the lords, 
but he hadn't seen or scented them. 

No one braved the notoriously muddy Terrasen roads in this weather. 
But with Ren Allsbrook in their company, Aedion had little doubt they'd 
stay hidden until sunset anyway. Unless the weather had delayed them. 
Which was a good possibility. 

Thunder boomed, so close that the trees shuddered. Lightning flashed 
with little pause for breath, limning the soaked leaves with silver, 
illuminating the world so brightly that his Fae senses were blinded. But at 
least he was dry. And warm. 

They'd avoided civilization so much that Aedion had hardly witnessed 
or been able to track how many magic-wielders had crept out of hiding--or 


who was now enjoying the return of their gifts. He'd only seen one girl, no 
older than nine, weaving tendrils of water above her village's lone fountain 
for the entertainment and delight of a gaggle of children. 

Stone-faced, scarred adults had looked on from the shadows, but none 
had interfered for better or worse. Aedion's messengers had already 
confirmed that most people now knew the King of Adarlan had wielded his 
dark powers to repress magic these last ten years. But even so, he doubted 
those who had suffered its loss, then the extermination of their kind, would 
comfortably reveal their powers anytime soon. 

At least until people like his companions, and that girl in the square, 
showed the world it was safe to do so. That a girl with a gift of water could 
ensure her village and its farmlands thrived. 

Aedion frowned at the darkening sky, idly twirling the Sword of Orynth 
between his palms. Even before magic had vanished, there had been one 
kind feared above all others, its bearers pariahs at best, dead at worst. 
Courts in every land had sought them as spies and assassins for centuries. 
But his court-- 

A delighted, throaty purr rumbled through their little camp, and Aedion 
shifted his stare to the subject of his thoughts. Evangeline was kneeling on 
her sleeping mat, humming to herself as she gently ran the horse's brush 
through Lysandra's fur. 

It had taken him days to get used to the ghost leopard form. Years in the 
Staghorns had drilled the gut-level terror into him. But there was Lysandra, 
claws retracted, sprawled on her belly as her ward groomed her. 

Spy and assassin indeed. A smile tugged on his lips at the pale green 
eyes heavy-lidded with pleasure. That'd be a fine sight for the lords to see 
when they arrived. 

The shape-shifter had used these weeks of travel to try out new forms: 
birds, beasts, insects that had a tendency to buzz in his ear or bite him. 
Rarely--so rarely--had Lysandra taken the human form he'd met her in. 
Given all that had been done to her and all she'd been forced to do in that 
human body, Aedion didn't blame her. 

Though she'd have to take human form soon, when she was introduced 
as a lady in Aelin's court. He wondered if she'd wear that exquisite face, or 
find another human skin that suited her. 


More than that, he often wondered what it felt like to be able to change 
bone and skin and color--though he hadn't asked. Mostly because Lysandra 
hadn't been in human form long enough to do so. 

Aedion looked to Aelin, seated across the fire with Fleetfoot sprawled 
in her lap, playing with the hound's long ears--waiting, as they all were. 
His cousin, however, was studying the ancient blade--her father's blade-- 
that Aedion so unceremoniously twirled and tossed from hand to hand, 
every inch of the metal hilt and cracked bone pommel as familiar to him as 
his own face. Sorrow flickered in her eyes, as fast as the lightning above, 
and then vanished. 

She'd returned the sword to him upon their departure from Rifthold, 
choosing to bear Goldryn instead. He'd tried to convince her to keep 
Terrasen's sacred blade, but she'd insisted it was better off in his hands, that 
he deserved the honor more than anyone else, including her. 

She'd grown quieter the farther north they'd traveled. Perhaps weeks on 
the road had sapped her. 

After tonight, depending on what the lords reported, he'd try to find her 
a quiet place to rest for a day or two before they made the last leg of the 
trek to Orynth. 

Aedion uncoiled to his feet, sheathing the sword beside the knife Rowan 
had gifted him, and stalked to her. Fleetfoot's feathery tail thumped in 
greeting as he sat beside his queen. 

"You could use a haircut," she said. Indeed, his hair had grown longer 
than he usually kept it. "It's almost the same length as mine." She frowned. 
"Tt makes us look like we coordinated it." 

Aedion snorted, stroking the dog's head. "So what if we did?" 

Aelin shrugged. "If you want to start wearing matching outfits as well, 
I'm in." 

He grinned. "The Bane would never let me live it down." 

His legion now camped just outside of Orynth, where he'd ordered them 
to shore up the city's defenses and wait. Wait to kill and die for her. 

And with the money Aelin had schemed and butchered to claim from 
her former master this spring, they could buy themselves an army to follow 
behind the Bane. Perhaps mercenaries, too. 

The spark in Aelin's eyes died a bit as if she, too, considered all that 
commanding his legion implied. The risks and costs--not of gold, but lives. 


Aedion could have sworn the campfire guttered as well. 

She had slaughtered and fought and nearly died again and again for the 
past ten years. Yet he knew she would balk at sending soldiers--at sending 
him--to fight. 

That, above all else, would be her first test as queen. 

But before that ... this meeting. "You remember everything I told you 
about them?" 

Aelin gave him a flat look. "Yes, I remember everything, cousin." She 
poked him hard in the ribs, right where the still-healing tattoo Rowan had 
inked on him three days ago now lay. All their names, entwined in a 
complex Terrasen knot right near his heart. Aedion winced as she jabbed 
the sore flesh, and he batted away her hand as she recited, "Murtaugh was a 
farmer's son, but married Ren's grandmother. Though he wasn't born into 
the Allsbrook line, he still commands the seat, despite his insistence that 
Ren take up the title." She looked skyward. "Darrow is the wealthiest 
landowner after yours truly, and more than that, he holds sway over the few 
surviving lords, mostly through his years of carefully handling Adarlan 
during the occupation." She gave him a glare sharp enough to slice skin. 

Aedion lifted his hands. "Can you blame me for wanting to make sure 
this goes smoothly?" 

She shrugged but didn't bite his head off. 

"Darrow was your uncle's lover," he added, stretching his legs out 
before him. "For decades. He's never spoken once to me about your uncle, 
but ... they were very close, Aelin. Darrow didn't publicly mourn Orlon 
beyond what was required after the passing of a king, but he became a 
different man afterward. He's a hard bastard now, but still a fair one. Much 
of what he's done has been out of his unfading love for Orlon--and for 
Terrasen. His own maneuvering kept us from becoming completely starved 
and destitute. Remember that." Indeed, Darrow had long straddled a line 
between serving the King of Adarlan and undermining him. 

"I. Know," she said tightly. Pushing too far--that tone was likely her 
first and last warning that he was starting to piss her off. He'd spent many 
of the miles they'd traveled these past few days telling her about Ren, and 
Murtaugh, and Darrow. Aedion knew she could likely now recite their land 
holdings, what crops and livestock and goods they yielded, their ancestors, 
and dead and surviving family members from this past decade. But pushing 


her about it one last time, making sure she knew ... He couldn't shut the 
instincts down to ensure it all went well. Not when so much was at stake. 

From where he'd been perched on a high branch to monitor the forest, 
Rowan clicked his beak and flapped into the rain, sailing through his shield 
as if it parted for him. 

Aedion eased to his feet, scanning the forest, listening. Only the trickle 
of rain on leaves filled his ears. Lysandra stretched, baring her long teeth as 
she did so, her needlelike claws slipping free and glinting in the firelight. 

Until Rowan gave the all clear--until it was just those lords and no one 
else--the safety protocols they'd established would hold. 

Evangeline, as they had taught her, crept to the fire. The flames pulled 
apart like drawn curtains to allow her and Fleetfoot, sensing the child's fear 
and pressing close, passage to an inner ring that would not burn her. But 
would melt the bones of their enemies. 

Aelin merely glanced at Aedion in silent order, and he stepped toward 
the western side of the fire, Lysandra taking up a spot at the southern point. 
Aelin took the northern but gazed west--toward where Rowan had flapped 
away. 

A dry, hot breeze flowed through their little bubble, and sparks danced 
like fireflies at Aelin's fingers, her hand hanging casually at her side. The 
other gripped Goldryn, the ruby in its hilt bright as an ember. 

Leaves rustled and branches snapped, and the Sword of Orynth gleamed 
gold and red in the light of Aelin's flames as he drew it free. He angled the 
ancient dagger Rowan had gifted him in his other hand. Rowan had been 
teaching Aedion--teaching all of them, really--about the Old Ways these 
weeks. About the long-forgotten traditions and codes of the Fae, mostly 
abandoned even in Maeve's court. But reborn here, and enacted now, as 
they fell into the roles and duties that they had sorted out and decided for 
themselves. 

Rowan emerged from the rain in his Fae form, his silver hair plastered 
to his head, his tattoo stark on his tan face. No sign of the lords. 

But Rowan held his hunting knife against the bared throat of a young, 
slender-nosed man and escorted him toward the fire--the stranger's travel- 
stained, soaked clothes bearing Darrow's crest of a striking badger. 

"A messenger," Rowan ground out. 


Aelin decided right then and there she didn't particularly enjoy surprises. 

The messenger's blue eyes were wide, but his rain-slick, freckled face 
was calm. Steady. Even as he took in Lysandra, her fangs gilded with 
firelight. Even as Rowan nudged him forward, that cruel knife still angled 
at his throat. 

Aedion jerked his chin at Rowan. "He can't very well deliver the 
message with a blade at his windpipe." 

Rowan lowered his weapon, but the Fae Prince didn't sheathe his knife. 
Didn't move more than a foot from the man. 

Aedion demanded, "Where are they?" 

The man bowed swiftly to her cousin. "At a tavern, four miles from 
here, General" 

The words died as Aelin at last stepped around the curve of the fire. She 
kept it burning high, kept Evangeline and Fleetfoot ensconced within. The 
messenger let out a small noise. 

He knew. With the way he kept glancing between her and Aedion, 
seeing the same eyes, the same hair color ... he knew. And as if the thought 
had hit him, the messenger bowed. 

Aelin watched the way the man lowered his eyes, watched the exposed 
back of his neck, his skin shining with rain. Her magic simmered in 
response. And that thing--that hideous power hanging between her breasts 
--seemed to open an ancient eye at all the commotion. 

The messenger stiffened, wide-eyed at Lysandra's silent approach, her 
whiskers twitching as she sniffed at his wet clothes. He was smart enough 
to remain still. 

"Is the meeting canceled?" Aedion said tightly, scanning the woods 
again. 

The man winced. "No, General--but they want you to come to the 
tavern where they're staying. Because of the rain." 

Aedion rolled his eyes. "Go tell Darrow to drag his carcass out here. 
Water won't kill him." 

"It's not Lord Darrow," the man said quickly. "With all due respect, 
Lord Murtaugh's slowed down this summer. Lord Ren didn't want him out 
in the dark and rain." 


The old man had ridden across the kingdoms like a demon from hell this 
spring, Aelin remembered. Perhaps it had taken its toll. Aedion sighed. 
"You know we'll need to scout the tavern first. The meeting will be later 
than they want." 

"Of course, General. They'll expect that." The messenger cringed as he 
at last spotted Evangeline and Fleetfoot within the flame's ring of safety. 
And despite the Fae Prince armed beside him, despite the ghost leopard 
with unsheathed claws sniffing at him, the sight of Aelin's fire made his 
face go deathly pale. "But they are waiting--and Lord Darrow is impatient. 
Being outside Orynth's walls makes him anxious. Makes us all anxious, 
these days." 

Aelin snorted softly. Indeed. 


Chapter 3 


Manon Blackbeak stood at attention by one end of the long, dark bridge 
into Morath and watched her grandmother's coven descend from the gray 
clouds. 

Even with the plumes and pillars of smoke from the countless forges, 
the High Witch of the Blackbeak Witch-Clan's voluminous obsidian robes 
were unmistakable. No other dressed as the Matron did. Her coven swept 
from the heavy cloud cover, keeping a respectful distance from the Matron 
and the extra rider flanking her massive bull. 

Manon, her Thirteen in rank behind her, made no movement as the 
wyverns and their riders landed on the dark stones of the courtyard across 
the bridge. Far below, the rushing of a filthy, ruined river roared, vying with 
the scrape of talons on stone and the rustle of settling wings. 

Her grandmother had come to Morath. 

Or what was left of it, when one-third was nothing more than rubble. 

Asterin hissed in a breath as Manon's grandmother dismounted in a 
smooth movement, scowling at the black fortress looming above Manon 
and her Thirteen. Duke Perrington was already waiting in his council 
chamber, and Manon had no doubt his pet, Lord Vernon, would do his best 
to undermine and shake her at every turn. If Vernon were to make a move to 
be rid of Manon, it would be now--when her grandmother was seeing for 
herself what Manon had accomplished. 

And failed to do. 

Manon kept her back straight as her grandmother strode across the 
broad stone bridge, her steps drowned out by the rush of the river, the beat 
of distant wings, and those forges working day and night to equip their 
army. When she could see the white in her grandmother's eyes, Manon 
bowed. 

The creak of flying leathers told her the Thirteen had followed suit. 


When Manon lifted her head, her grandmother was before her. 

Death, cruel and cunning, waited in that gold-flecked onyx stare. 

"Take me to the duke," the Matron said by way of greeting. 

Manon felt her Thirteen stiffen. Not at the words, but at the High 
Witch's coven now following on her heels. Rare--so rare for them to track 
her, guard her. 

But this was a citadel of men--and demons. And this would be an 
extended stay, if not permanent, judging by the fact that her grandmother 
had brought along the beautiful, dark-haired young witch currently 
warming her bed. The Matron would be a fool not to take extra protection. 
Even if the Thirteen had always been enough. Should have been enough. 

It was an effort not to flick out her iron nails at the imagined threat. 

Manon bowed again and turned in to the towering, open doors to 
Morath. The Thirteen parted for Manon and the Matron as they passed, then 
closed ranks like a lethal veil. No chances--not when the heir and the 
Matron were concerned. 

Manon's steps were near-silent as she led her grandmother through the 
dark halls, the Thirteen and the Matron's coven trailing close. The servants, 
through either spying or some human instinct, were nowhere to be found. 

The Matron spoke as they ascended the first of many spiral stairwells 
toward the duke's new council chamber. "Anything to report?" 

"No, Grandmother." Manon avoided the urge to glance sidelong at the 
witch--at the silver-streaked dark hair, the pale features carved with ancient 
hate, the rusted teeth on permanent display. 

The face of the High Witch who had branded Manon's Second. Who 
had cast Asterin's stillborn witchling into the fire, denying her the right to 
hold her once. Who had then beaten and broken her Second, thrown her into 
the snow to die, and lied to Manon about it for nearly a century. 

Manon wondered what thoughts now churned through Asterin's head as 
they walked. Wondered what went through the heads of Sorrel and Vesta, 
who had found Asterin in the snow. Then healed her. 

And never told Manon about it, either. 

Her grandmother's creature--that's what Manon was. It had never 
seemed like a hateful thing. 

"Did you discover who caused the explosion?" The Matron's robes 
swirled behind her as they entered the long, narrow hallway toward the 


duke's council chamber. 

"No, Grandmother." 

Those gold-flecked black eyes snapped to her. "How convenient, Wing 
Leader, that you complain about the duke's breeding experiments--only for 
the Yellowlegs to be incinerated days later." 

Good riddance, Manon almost said. Despite the covens lost in the blast, 
good rutting riddance that the breeding of those Yellowlegs-Valg witchlings 
had stopped. But Manon felt, rather than saw or heard, her Thirteen's 
attention fix on her grandmother's back. 

And perhaps something like fear went through Manon. 

At the Matron's accusation--and the line her Thirteen were drawing. 
Had drawn for some time now. 

Defiance. That's what it had been these past months. If the High Witch 
learned of it, she'd tie Manon to a post and whip her back until her skin was 
hanging in strips. She'd make the Thirteen watch, to prove their 
powerlessness to defend their heir, and then give them the same treatment. 
Perhaps chucking salted water on them when she was done. Then do it 
again, day after day. 

Manon said coolly, "I heard a rumor it was the duke's pet--that human 
woman. But as she was incinerated in the blaze, no one can confirm. I 
didn't want to waste your time with gossip and theories." 

"She was leashed to him." 

"It would seem her shadowfire was not." Shadowfire--the mighty 
power that would have melted their enemies within heartbeats when 
combined with the mirror-lined witch towers the three Matrons had been 
building in the Ferian Gap. But with Kaltain gone ... so was the threat of 
pure annihilation. 

Even if the duke would suffer no other master now that his king was 
dead. He'd rejected the Crown Prince's claim to the throne. 

Her grandmother said nothing as they continued onward. 

The other piece on the board--the sapphire-eyed prince who had once 
been in thrall to a Valg prince himself. Now free. And allied with that 
golden-haired young queen. 

They reached the council room doors, and Manon wiped all thoughts 
from her head as the blank-faced guards opened the black rock for them. 


Manon's senses honed to a killing calm the moment she laid eyes on the 
ebony glass table and who stood at it. 

Vernon: tall, lanky, ever-smirking, clad in Terrasen green. 

And a golden-haired man, his skin pale as ivory. 

No sign of the duke. The stranger twisted toward them. Even her 
grandmother gave pause. 

Not at the man's beauty, not at the strength in his sculpted body or the 
fine black clothes he wore. But at those gold eyes. Twin to Manon's. 

The eyes of the Valg kings. 


Manon assessed the exits, the windows, the weapons she would use when 
they fought their way out. Instinct had her stepping in front of her 
grandmother; training had her palming two knives before the golden-eyed 
man could blink. 

But the man fixed those Valg eyes on her. He smiled. 

"Wing Leader." He looked to her grandmother and inclined his head. 
"Matron." 

The voice was carnal and lovely and cruel. But the tone, the demand in 
it... 

Something in Vernon's smirk now seemed too strained, his tan skin too 
pale. 

"Who are you," Manon said to the stranger, more an order than a 
question. 

The man jerked his chin toward the unclaimed seats at the table. "You 
know perfectly well who I am, Manon Blackbeak." 

Perrington. In another body, somehow. Because... 

Because that otherworldly, foul thing she had sometimes glimpsed 
staring out through his eyes ... Here it was, given flesh. 

The Matron's tight face told her she'd already guessed. 

"I grew tired of wearing that sagging meat," he said, sliding with feline 
grace into the chair beside Vernon. A wave of long, powerful fingers. "My 
enemies know who I am. My allies might as well, too." 

Vernon bowed his head and murmured, "My Lord Erawan, if it would 
please you, allow me to fetch the Matron refreshments. Her journey has 


been long." 

Manon assessed the tall, reedy man. Two gifts he had offered them: 
respect to her grandmother, and the knowledge of the duke's true name. 
Erawan. 

She wondered what Ghislaine, on guard in the hall beyond, knew of 
him. 

The Valg king nodded his approval. The Lord of Perranth hustled to the 
small buffet table against the wall, grabbing a ewer as Manon and the 
Matron slid into the seats across from the demon king. 

Respect--something Vernon had not once offered without a mocking 
grin. But now... 

Perhaps now that the Lord of Perranth realized what manner of monster 
held his leash, he was desperate for allies. Knew, perhaps, that Manon ... 
that Manon might have indeed been part of that explosion. 

Manon accepted the carved-horn cups of water Vernon set before them 
but did not drink. Neither did her grandmother. 

Across the table, Erawan smiled faintly. No darkness, no corruption 
leaked from him--as if he were powerful enough to keep it contained, 
unnoticed, save for those eyes. Her eyes. 

Behind them, the rest of the Thirteen and her grandmother's coven 
remained in the hall, only their Seconds lingering in the room as the doors 
were sealed again. 

Trapping them all with the Valg king. 

"So," Erawan said, looking them over in a way that had Manon 
clamping her lips to keep from baring her teeth, "are the forces at the Ferian 
Gap prepared?" 

Her grandmother yielded a short dip of her chin. "They move at 
sundown. They'll be in Rifthold two days after that." 

Manon didn't dare shift in her seat. "You're sending the host to 
Rifthold?" 

The demon king flashed her a narrowed glance. "I am sending you to 
Rifthold, to take back my city. When you have finished your task, the 
Ferian legion will be stationed there under the command of Iskra 
Yellowlegs." 

To Rifthold. To finally, finally fight, to see what their wyverns could do 
in battle-- "Do they suspect the attack?" 


A lifeless smile. "Our forces will move too swiftly for word to reach 
them." No doubt why this information had been contained until now. 

Manon tapped a foot on the slate floor, already itching to move, to 
command the others in preparations. "How many of the Morath covens do I 
bring northward?" 

"Iskra flies with the second half of our aerial legion. I would think that 
only a few covens from Morath would be necessary." A challenge--and a 
test. 

Manon considered. "I fly with my Thirteen and two escort covens." No 
need for their enemies to get a good count on how many covens flew in the 
aerial legion--or for the entirety to go when she'd bet good money that 
even the Thirteen would be enough to sack the capital. 

Erawan just inclined his head in agreement. Her grandmother gave her a 
barely perceptible nod--as close to approval as she'd ever get. 

But Manon asked, "What of the prince?" King. King Dorian. 

Her grandmother shot her a look, but the demon said, "I want you to 
personally bring him to me. If he survives the attack." 

And with the fiery queen now gone, Dorian Havilliard and his city were 
defenseless. 

It mattered little to her. It was war. 

Fight this war, and go home to the Wastes at the end of it. Even if this 
man, this demon king, might very well renege on his word. 

She'd deal with that later. But first ... open battle. She could already 
hear its wild song in her blood. 

The demon king and her grandmother were speaking again, and Manon 
cleared away the melody of clashing shields and sparking swords long 
enough to process their words. 

"Once the capital is secured, I want those boats on the Avery." 

"The men of the Silver Lake have agreed?" Her grandmother studied 
the map weighted to the glass table by smooth stones. Manon followed the 
Matron's stare to the Silver Lake, at the other end of the Avery, and to its 
city, nestled against the White Fangs: Anielle. 

Perrington--Erawan--shrugged his broad shoulders. "Its lord has not 
yet declared allegiance to me or the boy-king. I suspect when word reaches 
him of Rifthold's demise, we will find his messengers groveling on our 
doorstep." A flicker of a smile. "Their Keep along the Western Falls of the 





lake still bears scars from the last time my armies marched. I have seen the 
countless monuments in Anielle to that war--its lord will know how easily 
I can again turn his city into a charnel house." 

Manon studied the map again, shutting out the questions. 

Old. The Valg king was so old as to make her feel young. To make her 
grandmother look like a child, too. 

Fool--perhaps her grandmother had been a fool to sell them into an 
unwitting alliance with this creature. She made herself meet Erawan's stare. 
"With strongholds in Morath, Rifthold, and Anielle, that only covers the 
southern half of Adarlan. What of north of the Ferian Gap? Or south of 
Adarlan?" 

"Bellhaven remains under my control--its lords and merchants love 
their gold too much. Melisande..." The demon king's golden eyes fixed on 
the western country across the mountains. "Eyllwe lies shattered beneath 
her, Fenharrow in barren shambles to the east. It remains in Melisande's 
best interest to continue allying her forces with my own, especially when 
Terrasen hasn't a copper to its name." The king's stare roamed northward. 
"Aelin Galathynius will have reached her seat by now. And when Rifthold 
is gone, she will also find how very alone she is in the North. Brannon's 
heir has no allies on this continent. Not anymore." 

But Manon noted the way the demon king's eyes darted to Eyllwe--just 
for a flicker. 

She looked to her grandmother, silent yet watching Manon with an 
expression that promised death if she pushed too far. But Manon said to 
Erawan, "Your capital is the heart of your commerce. If I unleash my legion 
upon it, you will have few human allies--" 

"Last I looked, Manon Blackbeak, it was my legion." 

Manon held Erawan's burning gaze, even as it stripped her bare. "Turn 
Rifthold into a complete ruin," she said flatly, "and rulers like the Lord of 
Anielle or the Queen of Melisande or the Lords of Fenharrow might very 
well find it worth the risk to rally against you. If you wreck your own 
capital, why should they believe your claims of alliance? Send a decree 
ahead of us that the king, the queen are enemies to the continent. Establish 
us as liberators of Rifthold, not conquerors, and you will have the other 
rulers thinking twice before allying with Terrasen. I will sack the city for 





you enough to display our might--but keep the Ironteeth host from leaving 
it in rubble." 

Those gold eyes narrowed with consideration. 

She knew her grandmother was one more word away from gouging her 
nails down Manon's cheek, but she kept her shoulders back. She didn't care 
about the city, its people. But this war could indeed turn against them if the 
annihilation of Rifthold united their scattered enemies. And delay the 
Blackbeaks that much more from returning to the Wastes. 

Vernon's eyes flicked to meet hers. Fear--and calculation. He 
murmured to Erawan, "The Wing Leader has a point, milord." What did 
Vernon know that she didn't? 

But Erawan angled his head, his golden hair sliding across his brow. 
"That is why you are my Wing Leader, Manon Blackbeak, and why Iskra 
Yellowlegs did not win the position." 

Disgust and pride warred in her, but she nodded. 

"One more thing." 

She remained still, waiting. 

The demon king lounged in his seat. "There is a glass wall in Rifthold. 
Impossible to miss." She knew it--had perched atop it. "Damage the city 
enough to instill fear, show our power. But that wall ... Bring it down." 

She only said, "Why?" 

Those golden eyes simmered like hot coals. "Because destroying a 
symbol can break the spirits of men as much as bloodshed." 

That glass wall--Aelin Galathynius's power. And mercy. Manon held 
that gaze long enough to nod. The king jerked his chin toward the shut 
doors in silent dismissal. 

Manon was out of the room before he'd turned back to Vernon. It did 
not occur to her until she was long gone that she should have remained to 
protect the Matron. 


The Thirteen did not speak until they had landed at their personal armory in 
the army camp below, had not even risked it while saddling their wyverns 
in the new aerie. 


Sweeping through the smoke and gloom that always wreathed Morath, 
the two escort covens Manon had selected--both Blackbeaks--steered for 
their own armories. Good. 

Now standing in the mud of the valley floor outside the cobbled- 
together labyrinth of forges and tents, Manon said to her assembled 
Thirteen, "We fly in thirty minutes." Behind them, blacksmiths and 
handlers were already rushing to haul armor onto the chained-down 
wyverns. 

If they were smart, or fast, they wouldn't wind up between those jaws. 
Already, Asterin's sky-blue mare was sizing up the man closest to her. 

Manon was half tempted to see if she'd take a bite out of him, but she 
said to her coven, "If we are lucky, we will arrive before Iskra and set the 
tone for how the sacking unfolds. If we are not, we seek out Iskra and her 
coven upon arriving and staunch the slaughter. Leave the prince to me." She 
didn't dare look at Asterin as she said it. "I have no doubt the Yellowlegs 
will try to claim his head. Stop any one of them who dares take it." 

And perhaps put an end to Iskra as well. Accidents happened all the 
time in battle. 

The Thirteen bowed their heads in acquiescence. Manon jerked her head 
over a shoulder, to the armory under the shoddy canvas tents. "Full armor." 
She gave them a slashing grin. "We don't want to make our grand 
appearance looking anything but our best." 

Twelve matching grins met hers, and they peeled away, heading toward 
the tables and dummies where their armor had been carefully and 
meticulously built these past months. 

Only Asterin remained at her side as Manon grabbed Ghislaine by an 
arm when the curly-haired sentinel strode past. 

She murmured over the clank of forges and roar of wyverns, "Tell us 
what you know of Erawan." Ghislaine opened her mouth, dark skin wan, 
and Manon snapped, "Concisely." 

Ghislaine swallowed hard, nodding as the rest of the Thirteen readied 
beyond them. The warrior-scholar whispered so only Manon and Asterin 
could hear. "He was one of the three Valg kings who invaded this world at 
the dawn of time. The other two were either killed or sent back to their dark 
world. He was stranded here, with a small army. He fled to this continent 
after Maeve and Brannon squashed his forces, and spent a thousand years 


rebuilding his numbers in secret, deep beyond the White Fangs. When he 
was ready, when he noticed that King Brannon's flame was dimming, 
Erawan launched his attack to claim this continent. Legend has it that he 
was defeated by Brannon's own daughter and her human mate." 

Asterin snorted. "It would seem that legend is wrong." 

Manon released Ghislaine's arm. "Get ready. Tell the others when you 
can." 

Ghislaine bowed her head and stalked into the arsenal. 

Manon ignored Asterin's narrow stare. Now was not the time for this 
conversation. 

She found the mute blacksmith by his usual forge, sweat streaming 
down his soot-stained brow. But his eyes were solid, calm, as he pulled 
back the canvas tarp on his worktable to reveal her armor. Polished, ready. 

The suit of dark metal had been fashioned like intricate wyvern scales. 
Manon ran a finger along the overlapping plates and lifted a gauntlet, 
perfectly formed to her own hand. "It's beautiful." 

Horrible, yet beautiful. She wondered what he made of the fact that he'd 
forged this armor for her to wear while ending the lives of his countrymen. 
His ruddy face revealed nothing. 

She stripped off her red cloak and began donning the armor bit by bit. It 
slid over her like a second skin, flexible and pliant where she needed it to 
be, unyielding where her life depended on it. 

When she was done, the blacksmith looked her over and nodded, then 
reached below his table to place another object on its surface. For a 
heartbeat, Manon only stared at the crowned helmet. 

It had been forged of the same dark metal, the nose and brow guards 
fashioned so that most of her face would be in shadow--save for her 
mouth. And her iron teeth. The six lances of the crown jutted upward like 
small swords. 

A conqueror's helm. A demon's helm. 

Manon felt the eyes of her Thirteen, now armed, upon her as she tucked 
her braid into the neck of her armor and lifted the helmet over her head. 

It fitted easily, its interior cool against her hot skin. Even with the 
shadows that hid most of her face, she could see the blacksmith with perfect 
clarity as his chin dipped in approval. 


She had no idea why she bothered, but Manon found herself saying, 
"Thank you." 

Another shallow nod was his only reply before she swept from his table. 

Soldiers cowered from her storming path as she signaled to the Thirteen 
and mounted Abraxos, her wyvern preening in his new armor. 

She didn't look back at Morath as they took to the gray skies. 


Chapter 4


Aedion and Rowan did not let Darrow's messenger go ahead to warn the 
lords of their arrival. If this was some maneuver to get them on uneven 
footing, despite all that Murtaugh and Ren had done for them this spring, 
then they'd gain the advantage whatever way they could. 

Aelin supposed that she should have taken the stormy weather as an 
omen. Or perhaps Murtaugh's age provided a convenient excuse for Darrow 
to test her. She leashed her temper at the thought. 

The tavern was erected at a crossroads just inside the tangle of 
Oakwald. With the rain and night settling in, it was packed, and they had to 
pay double to stable their horses. Aelin was fairly certain that one word 
from her, one flicker of that telltale fire, would have cleared out not only the 
stables, but also the tavern itself. 

Lysandra had padded off half a mile away, and when they arrived, she 
slunk from the bushes and nodded her fuzzy, drenched head at Aelin. All 
clear. 

Inside the inn, there were no rooms to be found for rent, and the 
taproom itself was crammed full of travelers, hunters, and whoever else was 
escaping the downpour. Some even sat against the walls--and Aelin 
supposed that it was how she and her friends might very well spend their 
evening once this meeting concluded. 

A few heads twisted their way as they entered, but dripping hoods and 
cloaks concealed their faces and weapons, and those heads quickly returned 
to their drinks or cards or drunken songs. 

Lysandra had finally shifted back into her human form--and true to her 
oath months ago, her once-full breasts were now smaller. Despite what 
awaited them in the private dining room at the back of the inn, Aelin caught 
the shape-shifter's eye and smirked. 


"Better?" she murmured over Evangeline's head as Darrow's 
messenger, Aedion at his side, strolled through the crowd. 

Lysandra's grin was half feral. "Oh, you have no idea." 

Behind them, Aelin could have sworn Rowan chuckled. 

The messenger and Aedion turned down a hallway, the dim candlelight 
flickering amongst the raindrops still sliding off the round, scarred shield 
strapped across her cousin's back. The Wolf of the North, who, even though 
he had won battles with his Fae speed and strength, had earned the respect 
and loyalty of his legion as a man--as a human. Aelin, still in her Fae form, 
wondered if she should have shifted herself. 

Ren Allsbrook waited in there. Ren, another childhood friend, whom 
she had almost killed, tried to kill this past winter, and who had no idea 
who she really was. Who had stayed at her apartment without realizing it 
belonged to his lost queen. And Murtaugh ... She had vague memories of 
the man, mostly involving him sitting at her uncle's table, slipping her extra 
blackberry tarts. 

Any good that remained, any shred of safety, it was thanks to Aedion, 
the dents and scratches marring his shield utter proof of it, and to the three 
men who awaited her. 

Aelin's shoulders began to curve inward, but Aedion and the messenger 
paused before a wooden door, knocking once. Fleetfoot brushed against her 
calf, tail wagging, and Aelin smiled down at the hound, who shook herself 
again, flinging droplets of water. Lysandra snorted. Bringing a wet dog into 
a covert meeting--very queenly. 

But Aelin had promised herself, months and months ago, that she would 
not pretend to be anything but what she was. She had crawled through 
darkness and blood and despair--she had survived. And even if Lord 
Darrow could offer men and funding for a war ... she had both, too. More 
would be better, but--she was not empty-handed. She had done that for 
herself. For them all. 

Aelin squared her shoulders as Aedion stepped into the room, already 
speaking to those inside: "Just like you bastards to make us trudge through 
the rain because you don't want to get wet. Ren, looking put-out, as usual. 
Murtaugh, always a pleasure. Darrow--your hair looks as bad as mine." 

Someone said from within in a dry, cold voice, "Given the secrecy with 
which you arranged this meeting, one would think you were sneaking 


through your own kingdom, Aedion." 

Aelin reached the ajar door, debating whether it was worth it to open the 
conversation by telling the fools inside to keep their voices down, but-- 

They were. With her Fae ears, she picked up more sounds than the 
average human. She stepped ahead of Lysandra and Evangeline, letting 
them enter behind her as she paused in the doorway to survey the private 
dining room. 

One window, cracked to soothe the stifling heat of the inn. A large 
rectangular table before a roaring hearth, littered with empty plates, crumbs, 
and worn serving platters. Two old men sat at it, one with the messenger 
whispering something in his ear too softly for her Fae hearing before he 
bowed to all of them and saw himself out. Both old men straightened as 
they looked past where Aedion stood before the table--to her. 

But Aelin focused upon the dark-haired young man by the hearth, an 
arm braced against the mantel, his scarred, tan face slack. 

She remembered those twin swords at his back. Those dark, burning 
eyes. 

Her mouth had gone slightly dry by the time she tugged back her hood. 
Ren Allsbrook started. 

But the old men had risen to their feet. She knew one of them. 

Aelin didn't know how she hadn't recognized Murtaugh that night she'd 
gone to the warehouse to end so many of them. Especially when he'd been 
the one who halted her slaughtering. 

The other old man, though ... while wrinkled, his face was strong-- 
hard. Without amusement or joy or warmth. A man used to getting his way, 
to being obeyed without question. His body was thin and wiry, but his spine 
was still straight. Not a warrior of the sword, but of the mind. 

Her great-uncle, Orlon, had been both. And kind--she'd never heard a 
stern or raging word from Orlon. This man, though ... Aelin held Darrow's 
gray-eyed gaze, predator recognizing predator. 

"Lord Darrow," she said, inclining her head. She couldn't help the 
crooked grin. "You look toasty." 

Darrow's plain face remained unmoved. Unimpressed. 

Well, then. 

Aelin watched Darrow, waiting--refusing to break his stare until he 
bowed. 


A dip of his head was all he offered. 

"A bit lower," she purred. 

Aedion's gaze snapped to her, full of warning. 

Darrow did no such thing. 

It was Murtaugh who bowed deeply at the waist and said, "Majesty. We 
apologize for sending the messenger to fetch you--but my grandson 
worries after my health." An attempt at a smile. "To my chagrin." 

Ren ignored his grandfather and pushed off the mantel, his boot-steps 
the only sound as he rounded the table. "You knew," he breathed to Aedion. 

Lysandra, wisely, shut the door and bid Evangeline and Fleetfoot to 
stand by the window--to watch for any peering eyes. Aedion gave Ren a 
little smile. "Surprise." 

Before the young lord could retort, Rowan stepped to Aelin's side and 
pulled back his hood. 

The men stiffened as the Fae warrior was revealed in his undimmed 
glory--glazed violence already in his eyes. Already focused on Lord 
Darrow. 

"Now, that is a sight I have not seen for an age," Darrow murmured. 

Murtaugh mastered his shock--and perhaps a bit of fear--enough to 
extend a hand toward the empty chairs across from them. "Please, sit. 
Apologies for the mess. We hadn't realized the messenger might retrieve 
you so swiftly." Aelin made no move to sit. Neither did her companions. 
Murtaugh added, "We can order fresh food if you wish. You must be 
famished." Ren shot his grandfather an incredulous look that told her 
everything she needed to know about the rebel's opinion of her. 

Lord Darrow was watching her again. Assessing. 

Humility--gratitude. She should try; she could try, damn it. Darrow had 
sacrificed for her kingdom; he had men and money to offer in the upcoming 
battle with Erawan. She had called this meeting; she had asked these lords 
to meet them. Who cared if it was in another location? They were all here. 
It was enough. 

Aelin forced herself to walk to the table. To claim the chair across from 
Darrow and Murtaugh. 

Ren remained standing, monitoring her with dark fire in his eyes. 

She said quietly to Ren, "Thank you--for helping Captain Westfall this 
spring." 








A muscle flickered in Ren's jaw, but he said, "How does he fare? 
Aedion mentioned his injuries in his letter." 

"Last I heard, he was on his way to the healers in Antica. To the Torre 
Cesme." 

"Good." 

Lord Darrow said, "Would you care to enlighten me on how you know 
each other, or shall I be required to guess?" 

Aelin began counting to ten at the tone. But it was Aedion who said as 
he claimed a seat, "Careful, Darrow." 

Darrow interlaced his gnarled but manicured fingers and set them on the 
table. "Or what? Shall you burn me to ash, Princess? Melt my bones?" 

Lysandra slipped into a chair beside Aedion and asked with the sweet, 
unthreatening politeness that had been trained into her, "Is there any water 
left in that pitcher? Traveling through the storm was rather taxing." 

Aelin could have kissed her friend for the attempt at dulling the razor- 
sharp tension. 

"Who, pray tell, are you?" Darrow frowned at the exquisite beauty, the 
uptilted eyes that did not shy from his despite her gentle words. Right--he 
had not known who traveled with her and Aedion. Or what gifts they bore. 

"Lysandra," Aedion answered, unbuckling his shield and setting it on 
the floor behind them with a heavy thunk. "Lady of Caraverre." 

"There is no Caraverre," Darrow said. 

Aelin shrugged. "There is now." Lysandra had settled on the name a 
week ago, whatever it meant, bolting upright in the middle of the night and 
practically shouting it at Aelin once she'd mastered herself long enough to 
shift back into her human form. Aelin doubted she'd soon forget the image 
of a wide-eyed ghost leopard trying to speak. She smiled a bit at Ren, still 
watching her like a hawk. "I took the liberty of buying the land your family 
yielded. Looks like you'Il be neighbors." 

"And what bloodline," Darrow asked, his mouth tightening at the brand 
across Lysandra's tattoo, the mark visible no matter what form she took, 
"does Lady Lysandra hail from?" 

"We didn't arrange this meeting to discuss bloodlines and heritage," 
Aelin countered evenly. She looked to Rowan, who gave a confirming nod 
that the inn staff was far from the room and no one was within hearing 
range. 


Her Fae Prince stalked to the serving table against the wall to fetch the 
water Lysandra had asked for. He sniffed it, and she knew his magic swept 
through it, probing the water for any poison or drug, while he floated four 
glasses over to them on a phantom wind. 

The three lords watched in wide-eyed silence. Rowan sat and casually 
poured the water, then summoned a fifth cup, filled it, and floated it to 
Evangeline. The girl beamed at the magic and went back to staring out the 
rain-splattered window. Listening while pretending to be pretty, to be 
useless and small, as Lysandra had taught her. 

Lord Darrow said, "At least your Fae warrior is good for something 
other than brute violence." 

"If this meeting is interrupted by unfriendly forces,' Aelin said 
smoothly, "you'll be glad for that brute violence, Lord Darrow." 

"And what of your particular skill set? Should I be glad of that, too?" 

She didn't care how he'd learned. Aelin cocked her head, choosing each 
word, forcing herself to think it through for once. "Is there a skill set that 
you would prefer I possess?" 

Darrow smiled. It didn't reach his eyes. "Some control would do Your 
Highness well." 

On either side of her, Rowan and Aedion were taut as bowstrings. But if 
she could keep her temper leashed, then they could-- 

Your Highness. Not Majesty. 

"Pll take that into consideration," she said with a little smile of her own. 
"As for why my court and I wished to meet with you today--" 

"Court?" Lord Darrow raised his silver brows. Then he slowly raked his 
stare over Lysandra, then Aedion, and finally Rowan. Ren was gaping at 
them all, something like longing--and dismay--on his face. "This is what 
you consider a court?" 

"Obviously, the court will be expanded once we're in Orynth--" 

"And for that matter, I do not see how there can even be a court, as you 
are not yet queen." 

She kept her chin high. "I'm not sure I catch your meaning." 

Darrow sipped from his tankard of ale. The plunk as he set it down 
echoed through the room. Beside him, Murtaugh had gone still as death. 
"Any ruler of Terrasen must be approved by the ruling families of each 
territory." 


Ice, cold and ancient, cracked through her veins. Aelin wished she could 
blame it on the thing hanging from her neck. 

"Are you telling me," she said too quietly, fire flickering in her gut, 
dancing along her tongue, "that even though I am the last living 
Galathynius, my throne does not yet belong to me?" 

She felt Rowan's attention fix upon her face, but she didn't look away 
from Lord Darrow. 

"I am telling you, Princess, that while you might be the last living direct 
descendant of Brannon, there are other possibilities, other directions to go 
in, should you be deemed unfit." 

"Weylan, please," Murtaugh cut in. "We did not accept the offer to meet 
for this. It was to discuss rebuilding, to he/p her and work with her." 

They all ignored him. 

"Other possibilities such as yourself?" Aelin asked Darrow. Smoke 
curled in her mouth. She swallowed it down, nearly choking on it. 

Darrow didn't so much as flinch. "You can hardly expect us to allow a 
nineteen-year-old assassin to parade into our kingdom and start yapping 
orders, regardless of her bloodline." 

Think it through, take a deep breath. Men, money, support from your 
already-broken people. Thats what Darrow offers, what you can stand to 
gain, if you just control your rutting temper. 

She stifled the fire in her veins into murmuring embers. "I understand 
that my personal history might be considered problematic--" 

"I find everything about you, Princess, to be problematic. The least of 
which is your choice in friends and court members. Can you explain to me 
why a common whore is in your company and being passed as a lady? Or 
why one of Maeve's minions is now sitting at your side?" He tossed a sneer 
in Rowan's direction. "Prince Rowan, is it?" He must have pieced it 
together from what the messenger had whispered in his ear upon arriving. 
"Oh, yes, we've heard of you. What an interesting turn of events, that when 
our kingdom is weakest and its heir so young, one of Maeve's most trusted 
warriors manages to gain a foothold, after so many years of gazing at our 
kingdom with such longing. Or perhaps the better question is, why serve at 
Maeve's feet when you could rule beside Princess Aelin?" 

It took considerable effort to keep her fingers from curling into fists. 
"Prince Rowan is my carranam. He is above any doubt." 


"Carranam. A long-forgotten term. What other things did Maeve teach 
you in Doranelle this spring?" 

She bit back her retort as Rowan's hand grazed hers beneath the table-- 
his face bored, uninterested. The calm of a feral, frozen storm. Permission 
to speak, Majesty? 

She had a feeling Rowan would very, very much enjoy the task of 
shredding Darrow into little pieces. She also had the feeling that she'd very, 
very much enjoy joining him. 

Aelin gave a slight nod, at a loss for words herself as she struggled to 
keep her flames at bay. 

Honestly, she felt slightly bad for Darrow as the Fae Prince gave him a 
look laced with three hundred years of cold violence. "Are you accusing me 
of taking the blood oath to my queen with dishonor?" 

Nothing human, nothing merciful in those words. 

To his credit, Darrow didn't shrink. Rather, he raised his brows at 
Aedion, then turned and shook his head at Aelin. "You gave away the 
sacred oath to this ... male?" 

Ren gaped a bit as he surveyed Aedion, that scar stark against his tan 
skin. She had not been there to protect him from it. Or to protect Ren's 
sisters when their magic academy became a slaughterhouse during 
Adarlan's invasion. Aedion caught Ren's surprise and subtly shook his 
head, as if to say, PUH explain later. 

But Rowan leaned back in his chair with a faint smile--and it was a 
horrifying, terrible thing. "I have known many princesses with kingdoms to 
inherit, Lord Darrow, and I can tell you that absolutely none of them were 
ever stupid enough to allow a male to manipulate them that way, least of all 
my queen. But if I were going to scheme my way onto a throne, I'd pick a 
far more peaceful and prosperous kingdom." He shrugged. "But I do not 
think my brother and sister in this room would allow me to live for very 
long if they suspected I meant their queen ill--or their kingdom." 

Aedion gave a grim nod, but beside him, Lysandra straightened--not in 
anger or surprise, but pride. It broke Aelin's heart as much as it lightened it. 

Aelin smiled slowly at Darrow, flames banking. "How long did it take 
you to come up with a list of every possible thing to insult me with and 
accuse me of during this meeting?" 


Darrow ignored her and jerked his chin at Aedion. "You're rather quiet 
tonight." 

"I don't think you particularly want to hear my thoughts right now, 
Darrow," Aedion replied. 

"Your blood oath is stolen by a foreign prince, your queen is an assassin 
who appoints common whores to serve her, and yet you have nothing to 
say?" 

Aedion's chair groaned, and Aelin dared a look--to find him gripping 
the sides of it so hard his knuckles were white. 

Lysandra, though stiff-backed, did not give Darrow the pleasure of 
blushing with shame. 

And she was done. Sparks danced at her fingertips beneath the table. 

But Darrow went on before Aelin could speak or incinerate the room. 
"Perhaps, Aedion, if you hope to still gain an official position in Terrasen, 
you could see if your kin in Wendlyn have reconsidered the betrothal 
proposition of so many years ago. See if they'll recognize you as family. 
What a difference it might have made, if you and our beloved Princess 
Aelin had been betrothed--if Wendlyn had not rejected the offer to formally 
unite our kingdoms, likely at Maeve's behest." A smile in Rowan's 
direction. 

Her world tilted a bit. Even Aedion had paled. No one had ever hinted 
that there had been an official attempt at betrothing them. Or that the 
Ashryvers had truly left Terrasen to war and ruin. 

"Whatever will the adoring masses say of their savior princess," Darrow 
mused, putting his hands flat on the table, "when they hear of how she has 
spent her time while they suffered?" A slap in the face, one after another. 
"But," Darrow added, "you've always been good at whoring yourself out, 
Aedion. Though I wonder if Princess Aelin knows what--" 

Aelin lunged. 

Not with flame, but steel. 

The dagger shuddering between Darrow's fingers flickered with the 
light of the crackling hearth. 

She snarled in the old man's face, Rowan and Aedion half out of their 
chairs, Ren reaching for a weapon, but looking sick--sick at the sight of the 
ghost leopard now sitting where Lysandra had been a moment ago. 


Murtaugh gaped at the shape-shifter. But Darrow glared at Aelin, his 
face white with rage. 

"You want to sling insults at me, Darrow, then go ahead," Aelin hissed, 
her nose almost touching his. "But you insult my own again, and I won't 
miss next time." She flicked her eyes to the dagger between the old man's 
splayed fingers, a hairsbreadth separating the blade from his speckled flesh. 

"I see you inherited your father's temper," Darrow sneered. "Is this how 
you plan to rule? When you don't like someone, you'll threaten them?" He 
slid his hand from the blade and pulled back far enough to cross his arms. 
"What would Orlon think of this behavior, this bullying?" 

"Choose your words wisely, Darrow," Aedion warned. 

Darrow lifted his brows. "All the work I have done, all that I have 
sacrificed these past ten years, has been in Orlon's name, to honor him and 
to save his kingdom--my kingdom. I do not plan to let a spoiled, arrogant 
child destroy that with her temper tantrums. Did you enjoy the riches of 
Rifthold these years, Princess? Was it very easy to forget us in the North 
when you were buying clothes and serving the monster who butchered your 
family and friends?" 

Men, and money, and a unified Terrasen. 

"Even your cousin, despite his whoring, helped us in the North. And 
Ren Allsbrook'"--a wave of the hand in Ren's direction--''while you were 
living in luxury, did you know that Ren and his grandfather were scraping 
together every copper they could, all to find a way to keep the rebel effort 
alive? That they squatted in shanties and slept under horses?" 

"That's enough," Aedion said. 

"Let him go on," Aelin said, sitting back in her seat and crossing her 
arms. 

"What else is there to say, Princess? Do you think the people of 
Terrasen will be glad to have a queen who served their enemy? Who shared 
a bed with the son of their enemy?" 

Lysandra snarled softly, rattling the glasses. 

Darrow was unfazed. "And a queen who now undoubtedly shares a bed 
with a Fae Prince who served the other enemy at our backs--what do you 
suppose our people will make of that?" 

She didn't want to know how Darrow had guessed, what he'd read 
between them. 


"Who shares my bed," she said, "is none of your concern." 

"And that is why you are not fit to rule. Who shares the queen's bed is 
everyone s concern. Will you lie to our people about your past, deny that 
you served the deposed king--and served his son, too, in a different 
manner?" 

Beneath the table, Rowan's hand shot out to grip her own, his fingers 
coated in ice that soothed the fire starting to flicker at her nails. Not in 
warning or reprimand--just to tell her that he, too, was struggling with the 
effort to keep from using the pewter food platter to smash in Darrow's face. 

So she didn't break Darrow's stare, even as she laced her fingers with 
Rowan's. 

"I will tell my people," Aelin said quietly but not weakly, "the entire 
truth. I will show them the scars on my back from Endovier, the scars on 
my body from my years as Celaena Sardothien, and I will tell them that the 
new King of Adarlan is not a monster. I will tell them that we have one 
enemy: the bastard down in Morath. And Dorian Havilliard is the only 
chance for survival--and future peace between our two kingdoms." 

"And if he is not? Will you shatter his stone castle as you shattered the 
glass one?" 

Chaol had mentioned this--months ago. She should have considered it 
more, that ordinary humans might demand checks against her power. 
Against the power of the court gathering around her. But let Darrow believe 
she'd shattered the glass castle; let him believe she'd killed the king. Better 
than the potentially disastrous truth. 

"Should you still wish to be a part of Terrasen," Darrow continued when 
none of them replied, "I'm sure Aedion can find some use for you in the 
Bane. But I will have no use for you in Orynth." 

She flicked her brows up. "Is there anything else that you have to say to 
me?" 

His gray eyes turned flinty. "I do not recognize your right to rule; I do 
not recognize you as the rightful Queen of Terrasen. Neither do the Lords 
Sloane, Ironwood, and Gunnar, who make up the remaining surviving 
majority of what was once your uncle's court. Even if the Allsbrook family 
sides with you, that is still one vote against four. General Ashryver has no 
lands or title here--and no say as a result. As for Lady Lysandra, Caraverre 
is not a recognized territory, nor do we recognize her lineage or your 


purchase of those lands." Formal words, for a formal declaration. "Should 
you return to Orynth and seize your throne without our invitation, it will be 
considered an act of war and treason." Darrow pulled a piece of paper from 
his jacket--lots of fancy writing and four different signatures on the 
bottom. "As of this moment, until it is otherwise decided, you shall remain 
a princess by blood--but not queen." 


Chapter 5


Aelin stared and stared at that piece of paper, at the names that had been 
signed long before tonight, the men who had decided against her without 
meeting her, the men who had changed her future, her kingdom, with just 
their signatures. 

Perhaps she should have waited to call this meeting until she was in 
Orynth--until her people saw her return and it would have been harder to 
kick her to the curb of the palace. 

Aelin breathed, "Our doom gathers in the South of Adarlan--yet this is 
what you focus on?" 

Darrow sneered, "When we have need of your ... skill set, we will send 
word." 

No fire burned in her, not even an ember. As if Darrow had clenched it 
in his fist, snuffed it out. 

"The Bane," Aedion said with a hint of that legendary insolence, "will 
answer to none but Aelin Galathynius." 

"The Bane," Darrow spat, "is now ours to command. In the event that 
there is no fit ruler on the throne, the lords control the armies of Terrasen." 
He again surveyed Aelin, as if sensing the vague plan to publicly return to 
her city, to make it harder for him to shut her out, glimmering as it formed. 
"Set foot in Orynth, girl, and you will pay." 

"Is that a threat?" Aedion snarled, a hand darting to grip the hilt of the 
Sword of Orynth sheathed at his side. 

"It is the law," Darrow said simply. "One generations of Galathynius 
rulers have honored." 

There was such a roaring in her head, and such a still emptiness in the 
world beyond. 

"The Valg march on us--a Valg king marches on us," Aedion pushed, 
the general incarnate. "And your queen, Darrow, might be the only person 


capable of keeping them at bay." 

"War is a game of numbers, not magic. You know this, Aedion. You 
fought at Theralis." The great plain before Orynth, host to the final, doomed 
battle as the empire had swept down upon them. Most of Terrasen's forces 
and commanders had not walked away from the bloodbath, so thorough 
streams ran red for days afterward. If Aedion had fought in it ... Gods, he 
must have been barely fourteen. Her stomach turned. Darrow concluded, 
"Magic failed us once before. We will not trust in it again." 

Aedion snapped, "We will need allies--" 

"There are no allies," Darrow said. "Unless Her Highness decides to be 
useful and gain us men and arms through marriage"--a sharp glance at 
Rowan--"we are alone." 

Aelin debated revealing what she knew, the money she'd schemed and 
killed to attain, but-- 

Something cold and oily clanged through her. Marriage to a foreign 
king or prince or emperor. 

Would this be the cost? Not just in blood shed, but in dreams yielded? 
To be a princess eternal, but never a queen? To fight with not just magic, 
but the other power in her blood: royalty. 

She could not look at Rowan, could not face those pine-green eyes 
without being sick. 

She had laughed once at Dorian--laughed and scolded him for 
admitting that the thought of marriage to anyone but his soul-bonded was 
abhorrent. She'd chided him for choosing love over the peace of his 
kingdom. 

Perhaps the gods did hate her. Perhaps this was her test. To escape one 
form of enslavement only to walk into another. Perhaps this was the 
punishment for those years in Rifthold's riches. 

Darrow gave her a small, satisfied smile. "Find me allies, Aelin 
Galathynius, and perhaps we shall consider your role in Terrasen's future. 
Think on it. Thank you for asking us to meet." 

Silently, Aelin rose to her feet. The others did as well. Save for Darrow. 

Aelin plucked up the piece of paper he had signed and examined the 
damning words, the scribbled signatures. The crackling fire was the only 
sound. 

Aelin silenced it. 





And the candles. And the wrought-iron chandelier over the table. 

Darkness fell, cleaved only by twin sharp inhales of breath--Murtaugh 
and Ren. The patter of rain filled the black room. 

Aelin spoke into the dark, toward where Darrow was seated. "I suggest, 
Lord Darrow, that you become accustomed to this. For if we lose this war, 
darkness will reign forever." 

There was a scratch and a hiss--then a match sputtered as it lit a candle 
on the table. Darrow's wrinkled, hateful face flickered into view. "Men can 
make their own light, Heir of Brannon." 

Aelin stared at the sole flame Darrow had sparked. The paper in her 
hands wilted into ashes. 

Before she could speak, Darrow said, "That is our law--our right. You 
ignore that decree, Princess, and you defile all that your family stood and 
died for. The Lords of Terrasen have spoken." 

Rowan's hand was solid against her lower back. But Aelin looked to 
Ren, his face tight. And over the roaring in her head, she said, "Whether or 
not you vote in my favor, there is a spot for you in this court. For what you 
helped Aedion and the captain do. For Nehemia." Nehemia, who had 
worked with Ren, fought with him. Something like pain rippled in Ren's 
eyes, and he opened his mouth to speak, but Darrow cut him off. 

"What a waste of a life that was," Darrow spat. "A princess actually 
dedicated to her people, who fought until her last breath for--" 

"One more word," Rowan said softly, "and I don't care how many lords 
support you or what your laws are. One more word about that, and I will gut 
you before you can get up from that chair. Understand?" 

For the first time, Darrow looked into Rowan's eyes and blanched at the 
death he found waiting there. But the lord's words had found their mark, 
leaving a shuddering sort of numbness in their wake. 

Aedion snatched Aelin's dagger off the table. "We'll take your thoughts 
into consideration." He scooped up his shield and put a hand on Aelin's 
shoulder to guide her from the room. It was only the sight of that dented 
and scarred shield, the ancient sword hanging at his side, that set her feet 
moving, slicing through that thick numbness. 

Ren moved to open the door, stepping into the hall beyond to scan it, 
giving Lysandra a wide berth as she padded past, Evangeline and Fleetfoot 
on her fluffy tail, secrecy be damned. 


Aelin met the young lord's eyes and drew in breath to say something, 
when Lysandra snarled down the hall. 

A dagger was instantly in Aelin's hand, angled and ready. 

But it was Darrow's messenger, hurtling for them. 

"Rifthold," he panted as he skidded to a stop, flinging rain on them. 
"One of the scouts from the Ferian Gap just raced past. The Ironteeth host 
flies for Rifthold. They mean to sack the city." 


Aelin stood in a clearing just past the inn's glow, the cold rain plastering her 
hair and raising bumps on her skin. Soaking them all, because Rowan now 
buckled on the extra blades she handed him, conserving each drop of his 
magic for what he was about to do. 

They'd let the messenger spill the information he'd recetved--not much 
at all. 

The Ironteeth host lingering in the Ferian Gap were now flying for 
Rifthold. Dorian Havilliard would be their target. Dead or alive. 

They'd be upon the city by nightfall tomorrow, and once Rifthold was 
taken ... Erawan's net across the middle of the continent would be 
complete. No forces from Melisande, Fenharrow, or Eyllwe could reach 
them--and none of Terrasen's forces could get to them, either. Not without 
wasting months to trek around the mountains. 

"There's nothing to be done for the city," Aedion said, his voice cutting 
through the rain. The three of them lingered under the cover of a large oak, 
all keeping an eye on Ren and Murtaugh, who were speaking with 
Evangeline and Lysandra, now back in her human form. Her cousin went 
on, rain pinging against the shield across his back, "If the witches fly on 
Rifthold, then Rifthold already is gone." 

Aelin wondered if Manon Blackbeak would be leading the attack--if 
it'd be a blessing. The Wing Leader had saved them once before, but only 
as a payment for a life debt. She doubted the witch would feel obliged to 
throw them a bone anytime soon. 

Aedion met Rowan's gaze. "Dorian must be saved at all costs. I know 
Perrington's--Erawan's--style. Don't believe any promises they make, and 


don't let Dorian be taken again." Aedion dragged a hand through his rain- 
soaked hair and added, "Or yourself, Rowan." 

They were the most hideous words she'd ever heard. Rowan's 
confirming nod made her knees buckle. She tried not to think about the two 
glass vials Aedion had handed the prince moments before. What they 
contained. She didn't even know when or where he'd acquired them. 

Anything but that. Anything but-- 

Rowan's hand brushed hers. "I will save him," he murmured. 

"I wouldn't ask this of you unless it was ... Dorian is vital. Lose him, 
and we lose any support in Adarlan." And one of the few magic-wielders 
who could stand against Morath. 

Rowan's nod was grim. "I serve you, Aelin. Do not apologize for 
putting me to use." 

Because only Rowan, riding the winds with his magic, could reach 
Rifthold in time. Even now, he might be too late. Aelin swallowed hard, 
fighting the feeling that the world was being ripped from under her feet. 

A glimmer of movement near the tree line caught her eye, and Aelin 
schooled her face into neutrality as she studied what had been left by little, 
spindly hands at the base of a gnarled oak. None of the others so much as 
blinked in its direction. 

Rowan finished with his weapons, glancing between her and Aedion 
with a warrior's frankness. "Where do I meet you once I've secured the 
prince?" 

Aedion said, "Run north. Stay clear of the Ferian Gap--" 

Darrow appeared at the other end of the clearing, barking an order for 
Murtaugh to come to him. 

"No," Aelin said. Both warriors turned. 

She stared northward into the roiling rain and lightning. 

She would not set foot in Orynth; she would not see her home. 

Find me allies, Darrow had sneered. 

She didn't dare glance at what the Little Folk had left in the shadow of 
that rain-lashed tree mere feet away. 

Aelin said to Aedion, "If Ren is to be trusted, you tell him to get to the 
Bane, and to be ready to march and press from the North. If we are not to 
lead them, then they will have to work around Darrow's orders as best they 


can. 


Aedion's brows rose. "What are you thinking?" 

Aelin jerked her chin at Rowan. "Get a boat and travel south with 
Dorian. Land is too risky, but your winds on the seas can get you there in a 
few days. To Skull's Bay." 

"Shit," Aedion breathed. 

But Aelin pointed with a thumb over a shoulder to Ren and Murtaugh as 
she said to her cousin, "You told me that they were in communication with 
Captain Rolfe. Get one of them to write a letter of recommendation for us. 
Right now." 

"I thought you knew Rolfe," Aedion said. 

Aelin gave him a grim smile. "He and I parted on ... bad terms, to say 
the least. But if Rolfe can be turned to our side..." 

Aedion finished for her, "Then we'd have a small fleet that could unite 
North and South--brave the blockades." 

And it was a good thing she'd taken all that gold from Arobynn to pay 
for it. "Skull's Bay might be the only safe place for us to hide--to contact 
the other kingdoms." She didn't dare tell them that Rolfe might have far 
more than a fleet of blockade runners to offer them, if she played it right. 
She said to Rowan, "Wait for us there. We'll strike out for the coast tonight, 
and sail to the Dead Islands. We'll be two weeks behind you." 

Aedion clasped Rowan on the shoulder in farewell and headed for Ren 
and Murtaugh. A heartbeat later, the old man was hobbling into the inn, 
Darrow on his heels, demanding answers. 

As long as Murtaugh wrote that letter to Rolfe, she didn't care. 

Alone with Rowan, Aelin said, "Darrow expects me to take this order 
lying down. But if we can rally a host in the South, we can push Erawan 
right onto the blades of the Bane." 

"Tt still might not convince Darrow and the others--" 

"PII deal with that later," she said, spraying water as she shook her 
head. "For now, I have no plans to lose this war because some old bastard 
has learned he likes playing king." 

Rowan's grin was fierce, wicked. He leaned in, grazing his mouth 
against hers. "I have no plans to let him keep that throne, either, Aelin." 

She only breathed, "Come back to me." The thought of what awaited 
him down in Rifthold struck her again. Gods--oh, gods. If anything 
happened to him... 


He brushed a knuckle down her wet cheek, tracing her mouth with his 
thumb. She put a hand on his muscled chest, right where those two vials of 
poison were now hidden. For a heartbeat, she debated turning the deadly 
liquid within into steam. 

But if Rowan was caught, if Dorian was caught ... "I can't--I can't let 
you go--" 

"You can," he said with little room for argument. The voice of her 
prince-commander. "And you will." Rowan again traced her mouth. "When 
you find me again, we will have that night. I don't care where, or who is 
around." He pressed a kiss to her neck and said onto her rain-slick skin, 
"You are my Fireheart." 

She grabbed his face in both hands, drawing him down to kiss her. 

Rowan wrapped his arms around her, crushing her against him, his 
hands roaming as if he were branding the feel of her into his palms. His kiss 
was savage--ice and fire twining together. Even the rain seemed to pause as 
they at last drew away, panting. 

And through the rain and fire and ice, through the dark and lightning 
and thunder, a word flickered into her head, an answer and a challenge and 
a truth she immediately denied, ignored. Not for herself, but for him--for 
him-- 

Rowan shifted in a flash brighter than lightning. 

When she finished blinking, a large hawk was flapping up through the 
trees and into the rain-tossed night. Rowan loosed a shriek as he banked 
right--toward the coast--the sound a farewell and a promise and a battle 
cry. 

Aelin swallowed the tightness in her throat as Aedion approached and 
gripped her shoulder. "Lysandra wants Murtaugh to take Evangeline. For 
'lady training.' The girl refuses to go. You might need to ... help." 

The girl was indeed clinging to her mistress, shoulders shaking with the 
force of her weeping. Murtaugh looked on helplessly, now back from the 
inn. 

Aelin stalked through the mud, the ground squelching. How far away, 
how long ago, their merry morning now seemed. 

She touched Evangeline's soaked hair, and the girl pulled back long 
enough for Aelin to say to her, "You are a member of my court. And as 


such, you answer to me. You are wise, and brave, and a joy--but we are 
headed into dark, horrible places where even I fear to tread." 

Evangeline's lip wobbled. Something in Aelin's chest strained, but she 
let out a low whistle, and Fleetfoot, who had been cowering from the rain 
under their horses, slunk over. 

"I need you to care for Fleetfoot,' Aelin said, stroking the hound's 
damp head, her long ears. "Because in those dark, horrible places, a dog 
would be in peril. You are the only one I trust with her safety. Can you look 
after her for me?" She should have cherished them more--those happy, 
calm, boring moments on the road. Should have savored each second they 
were all together, all safe. 

Above the girl, Lysandra's face was tight--her eyes shone with more 
than just the rain. But the lady nodded at Aelin, even as she surveyed 
Murtaugh once more with a predator's focus. 

"Stay with Lord Murtaugh, learn about this court and its workings, and 
protect my friend," Aelin said to Evangeline, squatting to kiss Fleetfoot's 
sodden head. Once. Twice. The dog absently licked the rain off her face. 
"Can you do that?" Aelin repeated. 

Evangeline stared at the dog, at her mistress. And nodded. 

Aelin kissed the girl's cheek and whispered into her ear, "Work your 
magic on these miserable old men while you're at it." She pulled away to 
wink at the girl. "Win me back my kingdom, Evangeline." 

But the girl was beyond smiles, and nodded again. 

Aelin kissed Fleetfoot one last time and turned to her awaiting cousin as 
Lysandra knelt in the mud before the girl, brushing back her wet hair and 
speaking too low for her Fae ears to detect. 

Aedion's mouth was a hard line as he dragged his eyes away from 
Lysandra and the girl and inclined his head toward Ren and Murtaugh. 
Aelin fell into step beside him, pausing a few feet from the Allsbrook lords. 

"Your letter, Majesty," Murtaugh said, extending a wax-sealed tube. 

Aelin took it, bowing her head in thanks. 

Aedion said to Ren, "Unless you want to swap one tyrant for another, I 
suggest you get the Bane and any others ready to push from the North." 

Murtaugh answered for his grandson, "Darrow means well--" 

"Darrow," Aedion interrupted, "is now a man of limited days." 


They all looked to her. But Aelin watched the inn flickering through the 
trees--and the old man once again storming for them, a force of nature in 
his own right. She said, "We don't touch Darrow." 

"What?" Aedion snapped. 

Aelin said, "I'd bet all my money that he's already taken the steps to 
ensure that if he meets an untimely death, we never set foot in Orynth 
again." Murtaugh gave her a grim, confirming nod. Aelin shrugged. "So we 
don't touch him. We play his game--play by rules and laws and oaths." 

Several feet away, Lysandra and Evangeline still spoke softly, the girl 
now crying in her mistress's arms, Fleetfoot anxiously nuzzling her hip. 

Aelin met Murtaugh's stare. "I do not know you, Lord, but you were 
loyal to my uncle--to my family these long years." She slid a dagger free of 
a hidden sheath along her thigh. They flinched as she sliced into her palm. 
Even Aedion started. Aelin clenched her bloodied palm into a fist, holding 
it in the air between them. "Because of that loyalty, you will understand 
what blood promises mean to me when I say if that girl comes to harm, 
physical or otherwise, I do not care what laws exist, what rules I will 
break." Lysandra had now turned to them, her shifter senses detecting 
blood. "If Evangeline is hurt, you will burn. All of you." 

"Threatening your loyal court?" sneered a cold voice as Darrow halted a 
few feet away. Aelin ignored him. Murtaugh was wide-eyed--so was Ren. 

Her blood seeped into the sacred earth. "Let this be your test." 

Aedion swore. He understood. If the Lords of Terrasen could not keep 
one child safe in their kingdom, could not find it in themselves to save 
Evangeline, to look after someone who could do them no good, gain them 
no wealth or rank ... they would deserve to perish. 

Murtaugh bowed again. "Your will is mine, Majesty." He added quietly, 
"I lost my granddaughters. I will not lose another." With that, the old man 
walked toward where Darrow waited, pulling the lord aside. 

Her heart strained, but Aelin said to Ren, that scar hidden by the 
shadows of his rain-drenched hood, "I wish we had time to speak. Time for 
me to explain." 

"You're good at walking away from this kingdom. I don't see why now 
would be different." 

Aedion let out a snarl, but Aelin cut him off. "Judge me all you like, 
Ren Allsbrook. But do not fail this kingdom." 


She saw the unspoken retort flash in Ren's eyes. Like you did for ten 
years. 

The blow struck low and deep, but she turned away. As she did, she 
noted how Ren's eyes fell on the little girl--on the brutal scars across 
Evangeline's face. Near-twins to the ones on his own. Something in his 
gaze softened, just a bit. 

But Darrow was now thundering toward Aelin, pushing past Murtaugh, 
his face white with anger. "You--" he started. 

Aelin held up a hand, flame leaping at her fingertips, rain turning to 
steam above it. Blood snaked down her wrist from the deep cut, sibling to 
the other on her right hand, bright as Goldryn's ruby, peeking over her 
shoulder. "P11 make one more promise," she said, folding her bloodied hand 
into a fist as she lowered it before them. Darrow tensed. 

Her blood dripped onto the sacred soil of Terrasen, and her smile turned 
lethal. Even Aedion held his breath beside her. 

Aelin said, "I promise you that no matter how far I go, no matter the 
cost, when you call for my aid, I will come. I promise you on my blood, on 
my family's name, that I will not turn my back on Terrasen as you have 
turned your back on me. I promise you, Darrow, that when the day comes 
and you crawl for my help, I will put my kingdom before my pride and not 
kill you for this. I think the true punishment will be seeing me on the throne 
for the rest of your miserable life." 

His face had gone from white to purple. 

She just turned away. 

"Where do you think you're going?" Darrow demanded. So 
Murtaugh had not filled him in on her plan to go to the Dead Islands. 
Interesting. 

She looked over her shoulder. "To call in old debts and promises. To 
raise an army of assassins and thieves and exiles and commoners. To finish 
what was started long, long ago." 

Silence was his answer. 

So Aelin and Aedion strode to where Lysandra now monitored them, 
solemn-faced in the rain, Evangeline hugging herself as Fleetfoot leaned 
against the silently weeping girl. 

Aelin said to the shape-shifter and the general, locking out the sorrow 
from her heart, locking out the pain and worry from her mind, "We travel 


99 


now. 

And when they dispersed to gather the horses, Aedion brushing a kiss to 
Evangeline's soaked head before Murtaugh and Ren led her back to the inn 
with considerable gentleness, Darrow striding ahead with no farewell 
whatsoever, when Aelin was alone, she finally approached that shadowed, 
gnarled tree. 

The Little Folk had known about the wyvern attack this morning. 

So she'd supposed that this little effigy, already falling apart under the 
torrent of rain, was another message of sorts. One just for her. 

Brannon's temple on the coast had been rendered carefully--a clever 
little contraption of twigs and rocks to form the pillars and altar ... And on 
the sacred rock in its center, they'd created a white stag from raw sheep's 
wool, his mighty antlers no more than curling thorns. 

An order--where to go, what she needed to obtain. She was willing to 
listen, play along. Even if it had meant telling the others only half the truth. 

Aelin broke apart the temple reconstruction but left the stag in her palm, 
the wool deflating in the rain. 

Horses nickered as Aedion and Lysandra hauled them closer, but Aelin 
felt him a heartbeat before he emerged between the distant, night-veiled 
trees. Too far in the wood to be anything but a ghost, a figment of an 
ancient god's dream. 

Barely breathing, she watched him for as long as she dared, and when 
Aelin mounted her horse, she wondered if her companions could tell that it 
was not rain gleaming on her face as she tugged on her black hood. 

Wondered if they, too, had spied the Lord of the North standing watch 
deep in the forest, the white stag's immortal glow muted in the rain, come 
to bid Aelin Galathynius farewell. 


100 


Dorian Havilliard, King of Adarlan, hated the silence. 

It had become his companion, walking beside him through the near- 
empty halls of his stone castle, crouching in the corner of his cluttered 
tower room at night, sitting across the table at each meal. 

He had always known he would one day be king. 

He had not expected to inherit a shattered throne and vacant stronghold. 

His mother and younger brother were still ensconced in their mountain 
residence in Ararat. He had not sent for them. He'd given the order to 
remain, actually. 

If only because it would mean the return of his mother's preening court, 
and he'd gladly take the silence over their tittering. If only because it would 
mean looking into his mother's face, his brother's face, and lying about who 
had destroyed the glass castle, who had slaughtered most of their courtiers, 
and who had ended his father. Lying about what his father had been--the 
demon that had dwelled inside him. 

A demon that had reproduced with his mother--not once, but twice. 

Standing on the small stone balcony atop his private tower, Dorian 
gazed at the glittering sprawl of Rifthold beneath the setting sun, at the 
sparkling ribbon of the Avery as it wended inland from the sea, curving 
around the city like the coils of a snake, and then flowing straight through 
the continent's heart. 

He lifted his hands before the view, his palms callused from the 
exercises and swordplay he'd made himself start learning once more. His 
favorite guards--Chaol's men--were all dead. 

Tortured and killed. 

His memories of his time beneath the Wyrdstone collar were dim and 
blurred. But in his nightmares, he sometimes stood in a dungeon far beneath 


this castle, blood that was not his own coating his hands, screams that were 
not his own ringing in his ears, begging him for mercy. 

Not him, he told himself. The Valg prince had done it. His father had 
done it. 

He'd still had difficulty meeting the stare of the new Captain of the 
Guard, a friend of Nesryn Faliq, as he'd asked the man to show him how to 
fight, help him become stronger, faster. 

Never again. Never again would he be weak and useless and frightened. 

Dorian cast his gaze southward, as if he could see all the way to Antica. 
He wondered if Chaol and Nesryn had gotten there--wondered if his friend 
was already at the Torre Cesme, having his broken body healed by its gifted 
masters. 

The demon inside his father had done that, too--snapped Chaol's spine. 

The man fighting inside his father had kept the blow from being fatal. 

Dorian had possessed no such control, no such strength, when he 
watched the demon use his own body--when the demon had tortured and 
killed and taken what it wanted. Maybe his father had been the stronger 
man in the end. The better man. 

Not that he'd ever had a chance to know him as a man. As a human. 

Dorian flexed his fingers, frost sparking in his palm. Raw magic--yet 
there was no one here to teach him. No one he dared ask. 

He leaned against the stone wall beside the balcony door. 

He lifted his hand toward the pale band marking his throat. Even with 
the hours he'd spent outside training, the skin where the collar had once laid 
had not darkened to a golden tan. Maybe it always would remain pale. 

Maybe his dreams would always be haunted by that demon prince's 
hissing voice. Maybe he would always wake up with his sweat feeling like 
Sorscha's blood on him, like Aelin's blood as he stabbed her. 

Aelin. Not a word from her--or from anyone regarding the queen's 
return to her kingdom. He tried not to worry, to contemplate why there was 
such silence. 

Such silence, when Nesryn and Chaol's scouts now brought him news 
that Morath was stirring. 

Dorian glanced inside, toward the pile of papers on his cluttered desk, 
and winced. He still had a disgusting amount of paperwork to do before 
sleep: letters to sign, plans to read-- 


Thunder murmured across the city. 

Perhaps a sign that he should get to work, unless he wanted to be up 
until the black hours of the morning once again. Dorian turned inside, 
sighing sharply through his nose, and thunder boomed again. 

Too soon, and the sound too short-lived. 

Dorian scanned the horizon. No clouds--nothing but the red-and-pink- 
and-gold sky. 

But the city lounging at the foot of the castle's hill seemed to pause. 
Even the muddy Avery seemed to halt its slithering as the boom sounded 
again. 

He had heard that sound before. 

His magic roiled in his veins, and he wondered what it sensed as ice 
coated his balcony against his will, so swift and cold the stones groaned. 

He tried to reel it back in--as if it were a ball of yarn that had tumbled 
from his hands--but it ignored him, spreading thicker, faster over the 
stones. Along the arch of the doorway behind him, down the curving face of 
the tower-- 

A horn sounded in the west. A high, bleating note. 

It was cut off before it finished. 

With the angle of the balcony, he couldn't see its source. He rushed into 
his room, leaving his magic to the stones, and hurtled for the open western 
window. He was halfway through the pillars of books and papers when he 
spied the horizon. When his city began screaming. 

Spreading into the distance, blotting out the sunset like a storm of bats, 
flew a legion of wyverns. 

Each bore armed witches, roaring their battle cries to the color-stained 
sky. 


Manon and her Thirteen had been flying without stop, without sleep. 
They'd left the two escort covens behind yesterday, their wyverns too 
exhausted to keep up. Especially when the Thirteen had been going on all 
those extra runs and patrols for months--and had quietly, solidly built up 
their stamina. 


They flew high to keep hidden, and through gaps in the clouds, the 
continent had flashed below in varying shades of summer green and butter 
yellow and sparkling sapphire. Today had been clear enough that no clouds 
concealed them as they hurtled for Rifthold, the sun beginning its final 
descent toward the west. 

Toward her lost homeland. 

With the height and distance, Manon fully beheld the carnage as the 
horizon at last revealed the sprawl of the capital city. 

The attack had begun without her. Iskra's legion was still falling upon it, 
still spearing for the palace and the glass wall that crested over the city at its 
eastern edge. 

She nudged Abraxos with her knees, a silent command to go faster. 

He did--but barely. He was drained. They all were. 

Iskra wanted the victory for herself. Manon had no doubt the 
Yellowlegs heir had received orders to yield ... but only once Manon 
arrived. Bitch. Bitch to get here first, not to wait-- 

Closer and closer they swept for the city. 

The screams reached them soon enough. Her red cape became a 
millstone. 

Manon aimed Abraxos for the stone castle atop the hill, barely peeking 
above that shining glass wall--the wall she had been ordered to bring down 
--and hoped she had not been too late in one regard. 

And that she knew what the hell she was doing. 


Chapter 6


Dorian had sounded the alarm, but the guards already knew. And when he'd 
gone to rush down the tower stairs, they blocked his path, telling him to 
stay in his tower. He tried to go again, to help--but they begged him to stay. 
Begged him, so that they would not lose him. 

It was the desperation, how young their voices were, that kept him in the 
tower. But not useless. 

Dorian stood atop his balcony, a hand raised before him. 

From the distance, he could do nothing as the wyverns unleashed hell 
beyond the glass wall. They shredded through buildings, ripping apart roofs 
with their talons, snatching up people--sis people--from the street. 

They covered the skies like a blanket of fangs and claws, and though 
arrows from the city guards hit true, the wyverns did not pause. 

Dorian rallied his magic, willing it to obey, summoning ice and wind to 
his palm, letting it build. 

He should have trained, should have asked Aelin to teach him 
something when she was here. 

The wyverns sailed closer to the castle and the glass wall still around it, 
as if they'd wanted to show him precisely how powerless he was before 
they came for him. 

Let them come. Let them get close enough for his magic. 

He might not have Aelin's long range, might not be able to encircle the 
city with his power, but if they got close enough... 

He would not be weak or cowering again. 

The first of the wyverns crested the glass wall. Huge--so much bigger 
than the white-haired witch and her scarred mount. Six of them flapped for 
his castle, for his tower. For its king. 

He'd give them a king. 


He let them draw nearer, clenching his fingers into a fist, burrowing 
down, down, down into his magic. Many witches lingered at the glass wall, 
slamming their wyverns' tails into it, cracking that opaque glass bit by bit. 
Like the six who sailed for the castle were all it would take to sack it. 

He could see their figures now--see their iron-studded leather, the 
setting sun glinting on the massive breastplates of the wyverns as they raced 
over the still-healing castle grounds. 

And when Dorian could see their iron teeth as they grinned at him, 
when the shouts of the guards so valiantly firing arrows from the castle 
doors and windows became a din in his ears, he extended his hand toward 
the witches. 

Ice and wind tore into them, shredding through beast and rider. 

The guards shouted in alarm--then fell into a stunned silence. 

Dorian gasped for breath, gasped to remember his name and what he 
was as the magic drained out of him. He'd killed while enslaved, but never 
of his own free will. 

And as the dead meat rained down, thudding on the castle grounds, as 
their blood misted the air ... More, his magic moaned, spiraling down and 
up at the same time, dragging him again into its icy eddies. 

Beyond the cracking glass wall, his city was bleeding. Screaming in 
terror. 

Four more wyverns crossed the now-crumbling glass wall, banking as 
the riders beheld their shredded sisters. Cries shattered from their immortal 
throats, the tendrils of the yellow bands across their brows snapping in the 
wind. They shot their wyverns into the sky, as if they'd rise and rise and 
then plunge down directly atop him. 

A smile danced on Dorian's lips as he unleashed his magic again, a two- 
pronged whip snapping for the ascending wyverns. 

More blood and chunks of wyvern and witch fell to the ground, all 
coated with ice so thick they shattered upon the courtyard flagstones. 

Dorian tunneled deeper. Maybe if he could get into the city, he could 
cast a wider net-- 

That was when the other attack hit. Not from ahead or above or below. 

But from behind. 

His tower rocked to the side, and Dorian was flung forward, slamming 
into the stone balcony, narrowly avoiding flipping over the edge. 


Stone cracked and wood splintered, and he was spared from a crushing 
bit of rock only by the magic he'd flung around himself as he covered his 
head. 

He whirled toward the interior of his bedroom. A giant, gaping hole had 
been ripped into the side and roof. And perched on the broken stone, a 
solidly built witch now smiled at him with flesh-shredding iron teeth, a 
faded band of yellow leather around her brow. 

He rallied his magic, but it sputtered to a flicker. 

Too soon, too fast, he realized. Too uncontrolled. Not enough time to 
draw up the full depths of his power. The wyvern's head snaked into the 
tower. 

Behind him, six other wyverns crested the wall, soaring for his exposed 
back. And the wall itself ... Aelin's wall ... Beneath those frantic, furious 
claws and tails ... it collapsed entirely. 

Dorian eyed the door to the tower stairs, where the guards should have 
already been charging through. Only silence waited. 

So close--but getting to it would require passing in front of the 
wyvern's maw. Exactly why the witch was smiling. 

One chance--he'd have one chance to do this. 

Dorian clenched his fingers, not granting the witch time to study him 
further. 

He flung out a hand, ice shattering from his palm and into the eyes of 
the wyvern. It roared, rearing back, and he ran. 

Something sharp nicked his ear and embedded in the wall before him. A 
dagger. 

He kept sprinting for the door-- 

The tail whipped through his vision a heartbeat before it slammed into 
his side. 

His magic was a film around him, shielding his bones, his skull, as he 
was hurled against the stone wall. Hard enough that the stones cracked. 
Hard enough that most humans would have been dead. 

Stars and darkness danced in his vision. The door was so close. 

Dorian tried to rise, but his limbs wouldn't obey. 

Stunned; stunned by-- 

Wet warmth leaked just below his ribs. Blood. Not a deep cut, but 
enough to hurt, courtesy of one of the spines on that tail. Spines coated in a 


greenish sheen. 

Venom. Some sort of venom that weakened and paralyzed before it 
killed-- 

He wouldn't be taken again, not to Morath, not to the duke and his 
collars-- 

His magic thrashed against the venom's paralyzing, lethal kiss. Healing 
magic. But slow, weakened by his careless expenditure moments before. 

Dorian tried to crawl for the door, panting through his gritted teeth. 

The witch barked a command to her wyvern, and Dorian rallied enough 
to crane his head. To see her draw her swords and begin to dismount. 

No, no, no-- 

The witch didn't make it to the ground. 

One heartbeat she was perched in her saddle, swinging a leg over. 

The next, her head was gone, her blood spraying her wyvern as it roared 
and turned-- 

And was slammed off the tower by another, smaller wyvern. Scarred 
and vicious, with glimmering wings. 

Dorian didn't wait to see what happened, didn't wonder. 

He crawled for the door, his magic devouring the venom that should 
have killed him, a raging torrent of light fighting with all of its considerable 
force against that greenish darkness. 

Cleaved skin, muscle, and bone itched as they slowly knit together-- 
and that spark flickered and guttered in his veins. 

Dorian was reaching for the door handle when the small wyvern landed 
in the ruined hole of his tower, its enormous fangs dripping blood onto the 
scattered paperwork he'd been grousing over mere minutes ago. Its 
armored, lithe rider nimbly leaped off, the arrows in the quiver across her 
back clacking against the hilt of the mighty sword now strapped alongside 
it. 

She hauled away the helmet crowned with slender, lancelike blades. 

He knew her face before he remembered her name. 

Knew the white hair, like moonlight on water, that spilled over her dark, 
scalelike armor; knew the burnt-gold eyes. 

Knew that impossibly beautiful face, full of cold bloodlust and wicked 
cunning. 

"Get up," Manon Blackbeak snarled. 


Shit. 

The word was a steady chant in Manon's head as she stalked across the 
ruins of the king's tower, armor thundering against the fallen stones, 
fluttering paper, and scattered books. 

Shit, shit, shit. 

Iskra was nowhere to be found--not by the castle, at least. But her 
coven was. 

And when Manon had spied that Yellowlegs sentinel perched inside the 
tower, readying to claim this kill for herself ... a century of training and 
instinct had barreled into Manon. 

All it had taken was one swipe of Wind-Cleaver as Abraxos flew by, 
and Iskra's sentinel was dead. 

Shit, shit, shit. 

Then Abraxos attacked the remaining mount, a dull-eyed bull who 
hadn't even the chance to roar before Abraxos's teeth were clamped around 
his broad throat and blood and flesh were flying as they tumbled through 
the air. 

She didn't have a heartbeat to spare to marvel that Abraxos had not 
balked at the fight, that he had not yielded. Her warrior-hearted wyvern. 
She'd give him an extra ration of meat. 

The young king's dark, bloody jacket was coated in dust and dirt. But 
his sapphire eyes were clear, if not wide, as she snarled again over the 
screaming city, "Get up." 

He reached a hand toward the iron door handle. Not to call for help or 
flee, she realized, now a foot from him, but to raise himself. 

Manon studied his long legs, more muscled than the last time she'd seen 
him. Then she noted the wound peeking through the side of his torn jacket. 
Not deep and not gushing, but-- 

Shit, shit, shit. 

The venom of the wyvern's tail was deadly at worst, paralyzing at best. 
Paralyzing with just a scratch. He should be dead. Or dying. 

"What do you want?" he rasped, eyes darting between her and Abraxos, 
who was busy monitoring the skies for any other attackers, his wings 
rustling with impatience. 


The king was buying himself time--while his wound healed. 

Magic. Only the strongest magic could have kept him from death. 
Manon snapped, "Quiet," and hauled him to his feet. 

He didn't flinch at her touch, or at the iron nails that snagged and ripped 
through his jacket. He was heavier than she'd estimated--as if he'd packed 
on more muscle beneath those clothes, too. But with her immortal strength, 
heaving him to a standing position required little energy. 

She'd forgotten how much taller he was. Face-to-face, Dorian panted as 
he stared down at her and breathed, "Hello, witchling." 

Some ancient, predatory part of her awoke at the half smile. It sat up, 
cocking its ears toward him. Not a whiff of fear. Interesting. 

Manon purred back, "Hello, princeling." 

Abraxos gave a warning growl, and Manon whipped her head to 
discover another wyvern sailing hard and fast for them. 

"Go," she said, letting him support himself as she hauled open the tower 
door. The screams of the men levels below rose to meet them. Dorian 
sagged against the wall, as if focusing all his attention on staying upright. 
"Is there another exit? Another way out?" 

The king assessed her with a frankness that had her snarling. 

Behind them, as if the Mother had stretched out her hand, a mighty 
wind buffeted the wyvern and rider away from the tower, sending them 
tumbling into the city. Even Abraxos roared, clinging to the tower stones so 
hard the rock cracked beneath his claws. 

"There are passages," the king said. "But you--" 

"Then find them. Get out." 

He didn't move from his spot against the wall. "Why." 

The pale line still sliced across his throat, so stark against the golden tan 
of his skin. But she did not take questioning from mortals. Not even kings. 
Not anymore. 

So she ignored his question and said, "Perrington is not as he seems. He 
is a demon in a mortal body, and has shed his former skin to don a new one. 
A golden-haired man. He breeds evil in Morath that he plans to unleash any 
day now. This is a taste." She flicked an iron-tipped hand to the destruction 
around them. "A way to break your spirits and win favor from other 
kingdoms by casting you as the enemy. Rally your forces before he is given 


a chance to grow his numbers to an unconquerable size. He means to take 
not just this continent, but the whole of Erilea." 

"Why would his crowned rider tell me this?" 

"My reasons are none of your concern. Flee." Again, that mighty wind 
blasted the castle, shoving back any approaching forces, setting the stones 
groaning. A wind that smelled of pine and snow--a familiar, strange scent. 
Ancient and clever and cruel. 

"You killed that witch." Indeed, the sentinel's blood freckled the stones. 
It coated Wind-Cleaver and her discarded helmet. Witch Killer. 

Manon shoved the thought away, along with his implied question. "You 
owe me a life debt, King of Adarlan. Prepare yourself for the day I come to 
claim it." 

His sensuous mouth tightened. "Fight with us. Now--fight with us now 
against him." 

Through the doorway, screams and battle cries rent the air. Witches had 
managed to land somewhere--had infiltrated the castle. It'd be a matter of 
moments before they were found. And if the king was not gone ... She 
yanked him off the wall and shoved him into the stairwell. 

His legs buckled, and he braced a tan hand against the ancient stone 
wall as he shot her a glare over a broad shoulder. A glare. 

"Do you not know death when you see it?" she hissed, low and vicious. 

"I have seen death, and worse," he said, those sapphire eyes frozen as 
he surveyed her from head to armored boot-tip and back again. "The death 
you'd offer is kind compared to that." 

It struck something in her, but the king was already limping down the 
stairs, a hand braced on the wall. Moving so damn slowly while that poison 
worked its way out of him, his magic surely battling with everything it had 
to keep him on this side of life. 

The door at the base of the tower shattered. 

Dorian halted at the four Yellowlegs sentinels who rushed in, snarling 
up the hollow center of the tower. The witches paused, blinking at their 
Wing Leader. 

Wind-Cleaver twitched in her hand. Kill him--kill him now, before they 
could spread the word that she'd been spotted with him ... Shit, shit, shit. 

Manon didn't have to decide. In a whirlwind of steel, the Yellowlegs 
died before they could turn toward the warrior who exploded through the 


doorway. 

Silver hair, tattooed face and neck, and slightly pointed ears. The source 
of that wind. 

Dorian swore, staggering down a step, but the Fae warrior's eyes were 
on her. Only lethal rage flickered there. 

The air in Manon's throat choked away into nothing. 

A strangled sound came out of her, and she stumbled back, clawing at 
her throat as if she could carve an airway. But the male's magic held firm. 

He'd kill her for what she'd tried to do to his queen. For the arrow 
Asterin had shot, meaning to strike the queen's heart. An arrow he had 
jumped in front of. 

Manon crashed to her knees. The king was instantly at her side, 
studying her for a heartbeat before he roared down the stairs, "NO!" 

That was all it took. Air flooded her mouth, her lungs, and Manon 
gasped, back arching as she drank it in. 

Her kind had no magical shields against attacks like that. Only when 
most desperate, most enraged, could a witch summon the core of magic in 
her--with devastating consequences. Even the most bloodthirsty and 
soulless of them only whispered of that act: the Yielding. 

Dorian's face swam in her watery vision. Manon still gasped for that 
fresh, lifesaving air as he said, "Find me when you change your mind, 
Blackbeak." 

Then the king was gone. 


Chapter 7 


Rowan Whitethorn had flown without food or water or rest for two days. 

He'd still reached Rifthold too late. 

The capital was in chaos under the claws of the witches and their 
wyverns. He'd seen enough cities fall over the centuries to know that this 
one was done for. 

Even if the people rallied, it would only be to meet their deaths head- 
first. The witches had already brought down Aelin's glass wall. Another 
calculated move by Erawan. 

It had been an effort to leave the innocent to fight on their own, to race 
hard and fast for the stone castle and the king's tower. He had one order, 
given to him by his queen. 

He'd still come too late--but not without a glimmer of hope. 

Dorian Havilliard stumbled as they hurried down the castle hallway, 
Rowan's keen ears and sense of smell keeping them from areas where the 
fighting raged. If the secret tunnels were watched, if they could not reach 
the sewers ... Rowan calculated plan after plan. None ended well. 

"This way," the king panted. It was the first thing Dorian had said since 
rushing down the stairs. They were in a residential part of the palace Rowan 
had only seen from his own scouting outside--in hawk form. The queen's 
quarters. "There's a secret exit from my mother's bedroom." 

The pale white doors to the queen's suite were locked. 

Rowan blasted through them with half a thought, wood splintering and 
impaling the lavish furniture, the art on the walls. Baubles and valuables 
shattered. "Sorry," Rowan said to the king--not sounding like it at all. 

His magic flickered, a distant flutter to let him know it was draining. 
Two days of riding the winds at breakneck speed, then fighting off those 
wyverns outside, had taken its toll. 





Dorian surveyed the casual damage. "Someone would have done it 
anyway." No feeling, no sorrow behind it. He hurried through the room, 
limping a bit. If the king had possessed a fraction less magic, he might have 
succumbed to the wyvern's venomous tail. 

Dorian reached a large, gilded portrait of a beautiful auburn-haired 
young woman with a sapphire-eyed babe in her arms. 

The king looked at it for a heartbeat longer than necessary, enough to 
tell Rowan everything. But Dorian hauled the painting toward him. It pulled 
away to reveal a small trapdoor. 

Rowan saw to it that the king went inside first, candle in hand, before 
using his magic to float the painting back into its resting place, then 
shutting the door behind them. 

The hall was cramped, the stones dusty. But the wind ahead whispered 
of open spaces, of dampness and mold. Rowan sent a tendril of magic to 
probe the stairs they now strode down and the many halls ahead. No sign of 
the cave-in from when they'd destroyed the clock tower. No signs of 
enemies lying in wait, or the corrupt reek of the Valg and their beasts. A 
small mercy. 

His Fae ears picked up the muffled screams and shouts of the dying 
above them. 

"I should stay," Dorian said softly. 

A gift of the king's magic, then--the enhanced hearing. Raw magic that 
could grant him any gifts: ice, flame, healing, heightened senses and 
strength. Perhaps shape-shifting, if he tried. 

"You are more useful to your people alive," Rowan said, his voice 
rough against the stones. Exhaustion nagged at him, but he shoved it aside. 
He'd rest when they were safe. 

The king didn't respond. 

Rowan said, "I have seen many cities fall. I have seen entire kingdoms 
fall. And the destruction I saw as I flew in was thorough enough that even 
with your considerable gifts, there is nothing you could have done." He 
wasn't entirely sure what they'd do if that destruction were brought to 
Orynth's doorstep. Or why Erawan was waiting to do it. He'd think about 
that later. 

"T should die with them," was the king's answer. 


They reached the bottom of the stairs, the passage now widening into 
breathable chambers. Rowan again snaked his magic through the many 
tunnels and stairs. The one to the right suggested a sewer entrance lay at its 
bottom. Good. 

"I was sent here to keep you from doing just that," Rowan said at last. 

The king glanced over his shoulder at him, wincing a bit as the motion 
stretched his still-healing skin. Where Rowan suspected a gaping wound 
had been minutes before, now only an angry red scar peeked through the 
side of his torn jacket. Dorian said, "You were going to kill her." 

He knew whom the king meant. "Why did you tell me not to?" 

So the king told him of the encounter as they descended deeper into the 
castle's bowels. "I wouldn't trust her,' Rowan said after Dorian had 
finished, "but perhaps the gods will throw us a bone. Perhaps the Blackbeak 
heir will join our cause." 

If her crimes weren't discovered first. But even if they only had thirteen 
witches and their wyverns, if that coven was the most skilled of all the 
Ironteeth ... it could mean the difference between Orynth falling or 
standing against Erawan. 

They reached the castle sewers. Even the rats were fleeing through the 
small stream entrance, as if the bellowing of the wyverns were a death 
knell. 

They passed an archway sealed off by collapsed stones--no doubt from 
the hellfire eruption this summer. 

Aelin's passageway, Rowan realized with a tug deep in his chest. And a 
few steps ahead, an old pool of dried blood stained the stones along the 
water's edge. A human reek lingered around it, tainted and foul. 

"She gutted Archer Finn right there," Dorian said, following his stare. 

Rowan didn't let himself think about it, or that these fools had 
unwittingly given an assassin a room that connected to their queen's 
chambers. 

There was a boat moored to a stone post, its hull almost rotted through, 
but solid enough. And the grate to the little river snaking past the castle 
remained open. 

Rowan again speared his magic into the world, tasting the air beyond 
the sewers. No wings cleaved it, no blood scented its path. A quiet, eastern 


part of the castle. If the witches had been smart, they'd have sentries 
monitoring every inch of it. 

But from the screaming and pleading going on above, Rowan knew the 
witches were too lost in their bloodlust to think straight. At least for a few 
minutes. 

Rowan jerked his chin to the boat. "Get in." 

Dorian frowned at the mold and rot. "We'll be lucky if it doesn't 
collapse around us." 

"You," Rowan corrected. "Around you. Not me. Get in." 

Dorian heard his tone and wisely got in. "What are you--" 

Rowan yanked off his cloak and threw it over the king. "Lie down, and 
put that over you." 

Face a bit pale, Dorian obeyed. Rowan snapped the ropes with a flash of 
his knives. 

He shifted, wings flapping loudly enough to inform Dorian what had 
happened. Rowan's magic groaned and strained while it pushed what 
looked like an empty, meandering vessel out of the sewers, as if someone 
had accidentally loosed it. 

Flying through the sewer mouth, he shielded the boat with a wall of 
hard air--containing the king's scent and keeping any stray arrows from 
piercing it. 

Rowan looked back only once as he flew down the little river, high 
above the boat. 

Only once, at the city that had forged and broken and sheltered his 
queen. 

Her glass wall was no more than chunks and shards gleaming in the 
streets and the grass. 

These past weeks of travel had been torture--the need to claim her, taste 
her, driving him out of his wits. And given what Darrow had said ... 
perhaps, despite his promise when he'd left, it had been a good thing that 
they had not taken that final step. 

It had been in the back of his mind long before Darrow and his horse- 
shit decrees: he was a prince, but in name only. 

He had no army, no money. The substantial funds he possessed were in 
Doranelle--and Maeve would never allow him to claim them. They'd likely 
already been distributed amongst his meddlesome cousins, along with his 





lands and residences. It wouldn't matter if some of them--the cousins he'd 
been raised with--might refuse to accept out of typical Whitethorn loyalty 
and stubbornness. All Rowan now had to offer his queen were the strength 
of his sword, the depth of his magic, and the loyalty of his heart. 

Such things did not win wars. 

He'd scented the despair on her, though her face had hidden it, when 
Darrow had spoken. And he knew her fiery soul: she would do it. Consider 
marriage to a foreign prince or lord. Even if this thing between them ... 
even if he knew it was not mere lust, or even just love. 

This thing between them, the force of it, could devour the world. 

And if they picked it, picked them, it might very well cause the end of 
it. 

It was why he had not uttered the words he'd meant to tell her for some 
time, even when every instinct was roaring for him to do it as they parted. 
And maybe having Aelin only to lose her was his punishment for letting his 
mate die; his punishment for finally letting go of that grief and loathing. 

The lap of waves was barely audible over the roar of wyverns and the 
innocents screaming for help that would never come. He shut out the ache 
in his chest, the urge to turn around. 

This was war. These lands would endure far worse in the coming days 
and months. His queen, no matter how he tried to shield her, would endure 
far worse. 

By the time the boat drifted down the little river snaking toward the 
Avery delta, a white-tailed hawk soaring high above it, the walls of the 
stone castle were bathed in blood. 


Chapter 8


Elide Lochan knew she was being hunted. 

For three days now, she'd tried to lose whatever tracked her through the 
endless sprawl of Oakwald. And in the process, she herself had become 
lost. 

Three days hardly sleeping, barely stopping long enough to scavenge 
for food and water. 

She'd turned south once--to backtrack and shake it off her trail. She'd 
wound up heading a day in that direction. Then west, toward the mountains. 
Then south, possibly east; she couldn't tell. She'd been running then, 
Oakwald so dense that she could hardly track the sun. And without a clear 
view of the stars, not daring to stop and find an easy tree to climb, she 
couldn't find the Lord of the North--her beacon home. 

By noon on the third day, she was close to weeping. From exhaustion, 
from rage, from bone-deep fear. Whatever took its time hunting her would 
surely take its time killing her. 

Her knife trembled in her hand as she paused in a clearing, a swift, 
nimble stream dancing through it. Her leg ached--her ruined, useless leg. 
She'd offer the dark god her soul for a few hours of peace and safety. 

Elide dropped the knife into the grass beside her, falling to her knees 
before the stream and drinking swift and deep. Water filled the gaps in her 
belly left by berries and roots. She refilled her canteen, hands shaking 
uncontrollably. 

Shaking so hard she dropped the metal cap into the stream. 

She swore, plunging into the cold water up to her elbows as she 
fumbled for the cap, patting the rocks and slick tendrils of river weed, 
begging for one solitary break-- 

Her fingers closed on the cap as the first howl sounded through the 
forest. 


Elide and the forest went still. 

She had heard dogs baying, had listened to the unearthly choruses of 
wolves when she'd been hauled from Perranth down to Morath. 

This was neither. This was... 

There had been nights in Morath when she'd been yanked from sleep 
because of howls like that. Howls she'd believed were imagined when they 
didn't sound again. No one ever mentioned them. 

But there was the sound. That sound. 

We shall create wonders that will make the world tremble. 

Oh, gods. Elide blindly screwed the cap onto the canteen. Whatever it 
might be, it was closing in fast. Maybe a tree--high up a tree--might save 
her. Hide her. Maybe. 

Elide twisted to shove her canteen into her bag. 

But a warrior was crouched across the stream, a long, wicked knife 
balanced on his knee. 

His black eyes devoured her, his face harsh beneath equally dark, 
shoulder-length hair as he said in a voice like granite, "Unless you want to 
be lunch, girl, I suggest you come with me." 

A small, ancient voice whispered in her ear that she'd at last found her 
relentless hunter. 

And they'd now both become someone else's prey. 


Lorcan Salvaterre listened to the rising snarls in the ancient wood and knew 
they were likely about to die. 

Well, the girl was about to die. Either at the claws of whatever pursued 
them or at the end of Lorcan's blade. He hadn't yet decided. 

Human--the cinnamon-and-elderberries scent of her was utterly human 
--and yet that other smell remained, that tinge of darkness fluttering about 
her like a hummingbird's wings. 

He might have suspected she'd summoned the beasts were it not for the 
tang of fear staining the air. And for the fact that he'd been tracking her for 
three days now, letting her lose herself in the tangled labyrinth of Oakwald, 
and had found little to indicate she was under Valg thrall. 


Lorcan rose to his feet, and her dark eyes widened as she took in his 
towering height. She remained kneeling by the stream, a dirty hand 
reaching for the dagger she'd foolishly discarded in the grass. She wasn't 
stupid or desperate enough to lift it against him. "Who are you?" 

Her hoarse voice was low--not the sweet, high thing he'd expected 
from her delicate, fully curved frame. Low and cold and steady. 

"If you want to die," Lorcan said, "then go ahead: keep asking 
questions." He turned away--northward. 

And that was when the second set of snarling began. From the other 
direction. 

Two packs, closing in. Grass and cloth rustled, and when he looked, the 
girl was on her feet, dagger angled, face sickly pale as she realized what 
was happening: they were being herded. 

"East or west," Lorcan said. In the five centuries he'd been slaughtering 
his way across the world, he'd never heard snarls like that from any manner 
of beast. He thumbed free his hatchet from where it was strapped at his 
side. 

"East," the girl breathed, eyes darting to either direction. "I--I was told 
to stay out of the mountains. Wyverns--large, winged beasts--patrol 
them." 

"I know what a wyvern is," he said. 

Some temper snapped in her dark eyes at his tone, but the fear washed it 
away. She began backing toward the direction she'd chosen. One of the 
creatures loosed a keening cry. Not a canine sound. No, this was high- 
pitched, screeching--like a bat. But deeper. Hungrier. "Run," he said. 

She did. 

Lorcan had to give the girl credit: despite the still-injured leg, despite 
the exhaustion that had made her sloppy these past few days, she bolted like 
a doe through the trees, her terror likely leeching away any pain. Lorcan 
leaped the wide stream in an easy movement, closing the distance between 
them in mere heartbeats. Slow; these humans were so damned slow. Her 
breathing was already ragged as she hauled herself up a hill, making enough 
noise to alert their trackers. 

Crashing from the brush behind them--from the south. Two or three 
from the sound of it. Big, from the snapping branches and thudding of 
footfalls. 


The girl hit the top of the hill, stumbling. She stayed upright, and 
Lorcan eyed the leg again. 

There was no point in having tracked her for so long if she died now. 
For a heartbeat, he contemplated the weight in his jacket--the Wyrdkey 
tucked away. His magic was strong, the strongest of any demi-Fae male in 
any kingdom, any realm. But if he used the key-- 

If he used the key, then he'd deserve the damnation it'd call down upon 
him. 

So Lorcan flung out a net of his power behind them, an invisible barrier 
wafting black tendrils of wind. The girl stiffened, whipping her head to him 
as the power rippled away in a wave. Her skin blanched further, but she 
continued, half falling, half running down the hill. 

The impact of four massive bodies against his magic struck a moment 
later. 

The tang of her blood as she sliced herself open on rock and root shoved 
itself up his nose. She was nowhere near fast enough. 

Lorcan opened his mouth to order her to hurry when the invisible wall 
snapped. 

Not snapped, but cracked, as if those beasts had cleaved it. 

Impossible. No one could get through those shields. Not even Rowan- 
rutting-Whitethorn. 

But sure enough, the magic had been sundered. 

The girl hit the gully at the bottom of the hill, near-sobbing at the flat 
expanse of forest sprawling ahead. She sprinted, dark braid thrashing, pack 
bouncing against her slim back. Lorcan moved after her, eyeing the trees to 
either side as the snarling and rustling began again. 

They were being herded, but toward what? And if these things had 
ripped his magic apart... 

It had been a long, long while since he'd had a new enemy to study, to 
break. 

"Keep going," he growled, and the girl didn't so much as look over her 
shoulder as Lorcan slammed to a stop between two towering oaks. He'd 
been spiraling down into his magic for days, planning to use it on the 
human-but-not girl when he grew bored of stalking her. Now his body was 
rife with it, the power aching to get out. 


Lorcan flipped his axe in his hand--once, twice, the metal singing 
through the dense forest. A chill wind edged in black mist danced between 
the fingers of his other hand. 

Not wind like Whitethorn's, and not light and flame like Whitethorn's 
bitch-queen. Not even raw magic like the new King of Adarlan. 

No, Lorcan's magic was that of will--of death and thought and 
destruction. There was no name for it. 

Not even his queen had known what it was, where it had come from. A 
gift from the dark god, from Hellas, Maeve had mused--a dark gift, for her 
dark warrior. And left it at that. 

A wild smile danced on Lorcan's lips as he let his magic rise to the 
surface, let its black roar fill his veins. 

He had crumbled cities with this power. 

He did not think these beasts, however fell, would fare much better. 

They slowed as they closed in, sensing a predator was waiting--sizing 
him up. 

For the first time in a damn long while, Lorcan had no words for what 
he saw. 

Maybe he should have killed the girl. Death at his hand would be a 
mercy compared to what snarled before him, crouching low on massive, 
flesh-shredding claws. Not a Wyrdhound. No, these things were far worse. 

Their skin was a mottled blue, so dark as to be almost black. Each long, 
lightly muscled limb had been ruthlessly crafted and honed. For the long 
claws at the end of their hands--five-fingered hands--now curled as if in 
anticipation of a strike. 

But it was not their bodies that stunned him. 

It was the way the creatures halted, smiling beneath their smashed in, 
bat-like noses to reveal double rows of needlelike teeth, and then stood on 
their hind legs. 

Stood to their full height, as a crawling man might rise. They dwarfed 
him by a foot at least. 

And the physical attributes that seemed unnervingly familiar were 
confirmed when the one closest to him opened its hideous mouth and said, 
"We have not tasted your kind's flesh yet." 

Lorcan's axe twitched up. "I can't say I've had the pleasure, either." 





There were very, very few beasts who could speak in the tongues of 
mortal and Fae. Most had developed it through magic, ill-gained or blessed. 

But there, slitted with pleasure in anticipation of violence, gleamed 
dark, human eyes. 

Whitethorn had warned of what was occurring in Morath--had 
mentioned the Wyrdhounds might be the first of many awful things to be 
unleashed. Lorcan hadn't realized those things would be nearly eight feet 
tall and part human, part whatever Erawan had done to turn it into this. 

The closest one dared a step but hissed--hissed at the invisible line he'd 
drawn. Lorcan's power flickered and throbbed at the poisoned claw-tips of 
the creature as it prodded the shield. 

Four against one. Usually easy odds for him. 

Usually. 

But he bore the Wyrdkey they sought, and that golden ring he'd stolen 
from Maeve, then given to and stolen from Aelin Galathynius. Athril's ring. 
And if they brought either to their master... 

Then Erawan would possess all three Wyrdkeys. And would be able to 
open a door between worlds to unleash his awaiting Valg hordes upon them 
all. And as for Athril's golden ring ... Lorcan had no doubt Erawan would 
destroy the ring forged by Mala herself--the one object in Erilea that 
granted immunity to its bearer against Wyrdstone ... and the Valg. 

So Lorcan moved. Faster than even they could detect, he hurled his axe 
at the creature farthest from him, its focus pinned on its companion as it 
prodded his shield. 

They all whirled toward their companion as the axe slammed into its 
neck, deep and permanent. All turned away to see it fall. Lethal by nature, 
but untrained. 

The beasts' attention diverted for a heartbeat, Lorcan's next two knives 
flew. 

Both blades embedded to the hilt in their ridged foreheads, their heads 
reeling back as the blows sent them clattering to their knees. 

The one in the center, the one who had spoken, loosed a primal scream 
that set Lorcan's ears ringing. It lunged for the shield. 

It rebounded, the magic denser this time. Lorcan drew his long-sword 
and a knife. 


And could only watch as the thing roared at the shield and slammed 
against it with both ruined, clawed hands ... and his magic, his shield, 
melted under its touch. 

It stepped through his shield like it was a doorway. "Now we'll play." 

Lorcan crouched into a defensive stance, wondering how far the girl had 
made it, if she'd even turned to look at what pursued them. The sounds of 
her flight had faded away. 

Behind the creature, its companions were twitching. 

No-- reviving. 

They each lifted a strong, clawed hand to the daggers through their 
skulls--and yanked them out. Metal rasped on bone. 

Only the one with its head now attached by a few tendons remained 
down. Beheading, then. 

Even if it meant getting close enough to do so. 

The creature before him smiled in savage delight. 

"What are you?" Lorcan ground out. 

The two others were now on their feet, the wounds in their heads 
already healed, bristling with menace. 

"We are hunters for His Dark Majesty," the leader said with a mock 
bow. "We are the ilken. And we have been sent to retrieve our quarry." 

Those witches had dispatched these beasts for him? Cowards, not to do 
their own hunting. 

The ilken went on, stepping toward him on legs that bent backward. 
"We were going to let you have a quick death--a gift." Its broad nostrils 
flared, scenting the silent forest. "But as you have stood between us and our 
prey ... we will savor your long end." 

Not him. He was not what the wyverns had been stalking these days, 
what these creatures had come to claim. They had no idea what he bore-- 
who he was. 

"What do you want with her?" he asked, monitoring the creeping 
approach of the three. 

"It is none of your concern," the leader said. 

"If there is a reward in it, I will help you." 

Dark, soulless eyes flashed toward him. "You do not protect the girl?" 

Lorcan gave a shrug, praying they couldn't scent his bluff as he bought 
her more time, bought himself time to work out the puzzle of their power. "I 


don't even know her name." 

The three ilken looked at one another, a glance of question and decision. 
Their leader said, "She is important to our king. Retrieve her, and he will 
fill you with power far greater than feeble shields." 

Was that the price for the humans they'd once been--magic that was 
somehow immune to what flowed naturally in this world? Or had the choice 
been taken from them, as surely as their souls had been stolen, too? 

"Why is she important?" 

They were now within spitting range. He wondered how long it'd take 
to replenish the supply of whatever power allowed them to cleave through 
magic. Perhaps they were buying themselves time, too. 

The ilken said, "She is a thief and a murderer. She must be brought to 
our king for justice." 

Lorcan could have sworn an invisible hand touched his shoulder. 

He knew that touch--had trusted it his entire life. It had kept him alive 
this long. 

A touch on his back to go forward, to fight and kill and breathe in death. 
A touch on his shoulder to instead run. To know that only doom waited 
ahead, and life lay behind. 

The ilken smiled once more, its teeth bright in the gloom of the wood. 

As if in answer, a scream shattered from the forest behind him. 


Chapter 9 


Elide Lochan stood before a creature birthed from a dark god's nightmares. 

Across the clearing, it towered over her, its talons digging into the loam 
of the forest floor. "There you are," it hissed through teeth sharper than a 
fish's. "Come with me, girl, and I will grant you a quick end." 

Lies. She saw how it sized her up, claws curling as if it could already 
feel them shredding into her soft belly. The thing had appeared in her path 
as if a cloud of night had dropped it there, and had laughed when she 
screamed. Her knife shook as she raised it. 

It stood like a man--spoke like one. And its eyes ... Utterly soulless, 
yet the shape of them ... They were human, too. Monstrous--what terrible 
mind had dreamed up such a thing? 

She knew the answer. 

Help. She needed help. But that man from the stream was likely dead at 
the claws of the other beasts. She wondered how long that magic of his had 
held out. 

The creature stepped toward her, its muscled legs closing the distance 
too quickly. She backed toward the trees, the direction she'd come from. 

"Is your blood as sweet as your face, girl?" Its grayish tongue tasted the 
air between them. 

Think, think, think. 

What would Manon do before such a creature? 

Manon, she remembered, came equipped with claws and fangs of her 
own. 

But a small voice whispered in her ear, So do you. Use what you have. 

There were other weapons than those made of iron and steel. 

Though her knees shook, Elide lifted her chin and met the black, human 
eyes of the creature. 


"Careful," she said, dropping her voice into the purr Manon had so 
often used to frighten the wits out of everyone. Elide reached into the 
pocket of her coat, pulling out the shard of stone and clenching it in her fist, 
willing that otherworldly presence to fill the clearing, the world. She prayed 
the creature wouldn't look at her fist, wouldn't ask what was in it as she 
drawled, "Do you think the Dark King will be pleased if you harm me?" 
She looked down her nose at it. Or as best as she could while standing 
several feet shorter. "I have been sent to look for the girl. Do not interfere." 

The creature seemed to recognize the fighting leathers then. 

Seemed to scent that strange, off scent surrounding the rock. 

And it hesitated. 

Elide kept her face a mask of cold displeasure. "Get out of my sight." 

She almost vomited as she began stalking toward it, toward sure death. 
But she stomped along, prowling as Manon had so often done. Elide made 
herself look up into the bat-like, hideous face as she passed. "Tell your 
brethren that if you interfere again, I will personally oversee what delights 
you experience upon Morath's tables." 

Doubt still danced in its eyes--along with real fear. A lucky guess, 
those words and phrases, based on what she'd overheard. She didn't let 
herself consider what had been done to make such a creature quake at the 
mention. 

Elide was five paces from the creature, keenly aware that her spine was 
now vulnerable to those shredding claws and teeth, when it asked, "Why 
did you flee at our approach?" 

She said without turning, in that cold, vicious voice of Manon 
Blackbeak, "I do not tolerate the questions of underlings. You have already 
disrupted my hunt and injured my ankle with your useless attack. Pray that I 
do not remember your face when I return to the Keep." 

She knew her mistake the moment it sucked in a hissing breath. 

Still, she kept her legs moving, back straight. 

"What a coincidence," it mused, "that our prey is similarly lamed." 

Anneith save her. Perhaps it had not noticed the limp until then. Fool. 
Fool. 

Running would do her no good--running would proclaim the creature 
had won, that it was right. She halted, as if her temper had yanked on its 


leash, and snapped her face toward the creature. "What is that you're 
hissing about?" 

Utter conviction, utter rage. 

Again the creature paused. One chance--just one chance. It'd learn 
soon enough that it had been duped. 

Elide held its gaze. It was like staring a dead snake in the eyes. 

She said with that lethal quiet the witches liked to use, "Do not make 
me reveal what His Dark Majesty put inside me on that table." 

As if in response, the stone in her hand throbbed, and she could have 
sworn darkness flickered. 

The creature shuddered, backing away a step. 

Elide didn't consider what she held as she sneered one last time and 
stalked away. 

She made it perhaps half a mile before the forest was again full of 
chittering life. 

She fell to her knees and vomited. 

Nothing but bile and water came out. She was so busy hurling up her 
guts with stupid fear and relief that she didn't notice anyone's approach 
until it was too late. 

A broad hand clamped on her shoulder, whirling her around. 

She drew her dagger, but too slowly. The same hand released her to slap 
the blade to the grass. 

Elide found herself staring into the dirt-splattered face of the man from 
the stream. No, not dirt. Blood that reeked--black blood. 

"How?" she said, stumbling away a step. 

"You first,' he snarled, but whipped his head toward the forest behind 
them. She followed his gaze. Saw nothing. 

When she looked at his harsh face, a sword lay against her throat. 

She tried to fall back, but he gripped her arm, holding her as steel bit 
into her skin. "Why do you smell of one of them? Why do they chase you?" 

She'd pocketed the stone, or else she might have shown him. But 
movement might cause him to strike--and that small voice whispered to 
keep the stone concealed. 

She offered another truth. "Because I have spent the past several months 
in Morath, living amongst that scent. They seek me because I managed to 
get free. I flee north--to safety." 


Faster than she could see, he lowered his blade--only to slice it across 
her arm. A scratch, barely more than a whisper of pain. 

They both watched as her red blood surged and dribbled. 

It seemed answer enough for him. 

"You can call me Lorcan," he said, though she hadn't asked. And with 
that, he hauled her over his broad shoulder like a sack of potatoes and ran. 

Elide knew two things within seconds: 

That the remaining creatures--however many there were--had to be on 
their trail and closing in fast. Had to have realized she'd bluffed her way 
free. 

And that the man, moving swift as a wind between the oaks, was demi- 
Fae. 


Lorcan ran and ran, his lungs gobbling down great gulps of the forest's 
stifling air. Slung over his shoulder, the girl didn't even whimper as the 
miles passed. He'd carried packs heavier than her over entire mountain 
ranges. 

Lorcan slowed when his strength at last began to flag, spent quicker 
thanks to the magic he'd used to get those three beasts into a stranglehold, 
battering past their natural-born immunity to it, then kill two while he 
pinned the other long enough to sprint for the girl. 

He'd been lucky. 

The girl, it seemed, had been smart. 

He jogged into a stop, setting her down hard enough that she winced-- 
winced and hopped a bit on that hurt ankle. Her blood had flowed red 
instead of the reeking black that implied Valg possession, but it still didn't 
explain how she'd been able to intimidate that ilken into submission. 

"Where are we going?" she said, swinging her pack to pull out her 
canteen. He waited for the tears and prayers and begging. She just 
unscrewed the cap of the leather-coated container and swigged deep. Then, 
to his surprise, offered him some. 

Lorcan didn't take it. She merely drank again. 

"We're going to the edge of the forest--to the Acanthus River." 


""Where--where are we?" The hesitation said enough: she'd calculated 
the risk of revealing how vulnerable she was with that question ... and 
decided she was too desperate for the answer. 

"What is your name?" 

"Marion." She held his gaze with a sort of unflinching steel that had 
him angling his head. 

An answer for an answer. He said, ""We're in the middle of Adarlan. You 
were about a day's hike from the Avery River." 

Marion blinked. He wondered if she even knew that--or had considered 
how she'd cross the mighty body of water that had claimed ships captained 
by the most seasoned of men and women. 

She said, "Are we running, or can I sit for a moment?" 

He listened to the sounds of the forest for any hint of danger, then jerked 
his chin. 

Marion sighed as she sat on the moss and roots. She surveyed him. "I 
thought all the Fae were dead. Even the demi-Fae." 

"I'm from Wendlyn. And you," he said, brows rising slightly, "are from 
Morath." 

"Not from. Escaping from." 

"Why--and how." 

Her narrowed eyes told him enough: she knew he still didn't believe 
her, not entirely, red blood or no. Yet she didn't answer, instead leaning over 
her legs to unlace a boot. Her fingers trembled a bit, but she got through the 
laces, yanking off the boot, removing the sock, and rolling up her leather 
pant leg to reveal-- 

Shit. He'd seen plenty of ruined bodies in his day, had done plenty of 
ruining himself, but rarely were they left so untreated. Marion's leg was a 
mess of scar tissue and twisted bone. And right above her misshapen ankle 
lay still-healing wounds where shackles had unmistakably been. 

She said quietly, "Allies of Morath are usually whole. Their dark magic 
could surely cure a cripple--and they surely would have no use for one." 

That was why she'd managed so well with the limp. She'd had years to 
master it, from the coloring of the scar tissue. 

Marion rolled her pant leg back down but left her foot bare, massaging 
it. She hissed through her teeth. 


He sat on a fallen log a few feet away, taking off his own pack to rifle 
through it. "Tell me what you know of Morath," he said, and chucked her a 
tin of salve straight from Doranelle. 

The girl stared at it, those sharp eyes putting together what he was, 
where he was from, and what that tin likely contained. When she lifted 
them to his face, she nodded silently in agreement of his offer: relief from 
the pain for answers. She unscrewed the lid, and he caught the way her 
mouth parted as she breathed in the pungent herbs. 

Pain and pleasure danced across her face as she began rubbing the salve 
into her old injuries. 

And as she worked, she spoke. 

Marion told him of the Ironteeth host, of the Wing Leader and the 
Thirteen, of the armies camped around the mountain Keep, of the places 
where only screaming echoed, of the countless forges and blacksmiths. She 
described her own escape: without warning, she didn't know how, the castle 
had exploded. She'd seen it as her chance, disguising herself in a witch's 
attire, grabbing one of their packs, and running. In the chaos, no one had 
chased her. 

"Pve been running for weeks," she said. "Apparently, I've barely 
covered half the distance." 

"To where?" 

Marion looked northward. "Terrasen." 

Lorcan stifled a snarl. "You're not missing much." 

"Have you news of it?" Alarm filled those eyes. 

"No," he said, shrugging. She finished rubbing her foot and ankle. 
"What's in Terrasen? Your family?" He had not asked why she'd been 
brought to Morath. He didn't particularly care to hear her sad story. 
Everyone had one, he'd found. 

The girl's face tightened. "I owe a debt to a friend--someone who 
helped me get out of Morath. She bade me to find someone named Celaena 
Sardothien. So that is my first task: learning who she is, where she is. 
Terrasen seems like a better place to start than Adarlan." 

No guile, no whisper of this meeting being anything but chance. 

"And then," the girl went on, the brightness in her eyes growing, "I 
need to find Aelin Galathynius, the Queen of Terrasen." 

It was an effort not to go for his sword. "Why?" 


Marion glanced toward him, as if she'd somehow even forgotten he was 
there. "I heard a rumor that she's raising an army to stop the one in Morath. 
I plan to offer my services." 

"Why?" he said again. Aside from the wits that had kept her out of the 
ilken's claws, he saw no other reason for the bitch-queen to need the girl. 

Marion's full mouth tightened. "Because I am from Terrasen and 
believed my queen dead. And now she is alive, and fighting, so I will fight 
with her. So that no other girls will be taken from their homes and brought 
to Morath and forgotten." 

Lorcan debated telling her what he knew: that her two quests were one 
and the same. But that would lead to questions from her, and he was in no 
mood-- 

"Why do you wish to go to Morath? Everyone else is fleeing from it." 

"I was sent by my mistress to stop the threat it poses." 

"You're one man--male." Not an insult, but Lorcan stared her down 
anyway. 

"I have my skills, just as you have yours." 

Her eyes darted to his hands, now crusted in dried black blood. He 
wondered, though, if she was imagining the magic that had sparked there. 

He waited for Marion to ask more, but she pulled on her sock, then her 
boot, and laced it up. "We shouldn't rest for long." Indeed. 

She eased to her feet, wincing a bit, but gave an appreciative frown 
toward her leg. Lorcan took that as answer enough regarding the salve's 
efficiency. She bent down to retrieve the tin, her dark curtain of hair 
sweeping over her face. At some point, it had come free of its braid. 

She rose, chucking him the tin. He caught it in one hand. "Once we 
reach the Acanthus, what then?" 

He pocketed the tin in his cloak. "There are countless merchants' 
caravans and seasonal carnivals wandering the plains--I passed many on 
my way down here. Some might even be trying to cross the river. We'll get 
in with one of them. Hide out. Once we've crossed and wandered far 
enough onto the grasslands, you'll take one north; P1 head south." 

Her eyes narrowed slightly. But Marion said, "Why travel with me at 
all?" 

"There are more details regarding Morath's interior that I want from 
you. I'll keep you from danger, and yov'll provide them for me." 


The sun began its final descent, bathing the woods in gold. Marion 
frowned slightly. "You swear it? That you will protect me?" 

"I didn't leave you to the ilken today, did I?" 

She eyed him with a clarity and frankness that made him pause. "Swear 
it." 

He rolled his eyes. "I promise." The girl had no idea that for the past 
five centuries, promises were the only currency he really traded in. "I will 
not abandon you." 

She nodded, seemingly satisfied with that. "Then I will tell you what I 
know." 

He started eastward, slinging his pack over his shoulder. 

But Marion said, "They'Il be hunting for us at every crossing, searching 
wagons. If they could find me here, they'! find me on any main road." 

And find him, too, if the witches were still out for his blood. 

Lorcan said, "And you have some idea around this?" 

A faint smile danced around her rosebud mouth, despite the horrors 
they'd escaped, her misery in the woods. "I might." 


Chapter 10 


Manon Blackbeak landed in Morath more than ready to start slitting throats. 

Everything had gone to shit. 

Everything. 

She'd ended that Yellowlegs bitch and her wyvern, saved the sapphire- 
eyed king, and watched the Fae Prince slaughter those four other 
Yellowlegs sentinels. 

Five. Five Yellowlegs witches now lay dead, either by her hand or 
through her inaction. Five members of Iskra's coven. 

In the end, she'd barely participated in Rifthold's destruction, leaving it 
to the others. But she'd again donned her crowned helm, then ordered 
Abraxos to sail to the highest spire of the stone castle and roar his victory-- 
and command. 

Even at the distant white walls of the city, ripping apart the guards and 
fleeing folk, the wyverns had paused at his order to stand down. Not one 
coven disobeyed. 

The Thirteen had found her moments later. She didn't tell them what 
had happened, but both Sorrel and Asterin stared closely at her: the former 
to inspect for any cuts or wounds received during the "attack" Manon had 
claimed occurred, the latter because she had been with Manon that day 
they'd flown to Rifthold and painted a message to the Queen of Terrasen in 
Valg blood. 

With the Thirteen perched on the castle towers, some draped along them 
like cats or serpents, Manon had waited for Iskra Yellowlegs. 

As Manon now stalked down the dim, reeking halls of Morath, that 
crowned helm tucked into the crook of her arm, Asterin and Sorrel on her 
heels, she went over that conversation again. 

Iskra had landed on the only space left: a lower bit of roofing below 
Manon. The positioning had been intentional. 


Iskra's brown hair had come untangled from her tight braid, and her 
haughty face was splattered with human blood as she'd snarled at Manon, 
"This was my victory." 

Her face veiled in shadow beneath the helm, Manon had said, "The city 
is mine." 

"Rifthold was mine to take--you were only to oversee." A flash of iron 
teeth. On the spire to Manon's right, Asterin growled in warning. Iskra cast 
her dark eyes on the blond sentinel and snarled again. "Get your pack of 
bitches out of my city." 

Manon sized up Fendir, Iskra's bull. "You've left your mark enough. 
Your work is noted." 

Iskra trembled with rage. Not from the words. 

The wind had shifted, blowing toward Iskra. 

Blowing Manon's scent at her. 

"Who?" Iskra seethed. "Who of mine did you butcher?" 

Manon had not yielded, had not allowed one flicker of regret or worry 
to shine through. "Why should I know any of your names? She attacked me 
as I closed in on my prey, wanting to get the king for herself and willing to 
strike an heir for it. She deserved her punishment. Especially because my 
prey slipped away while I dealt with her." 

Liar liar liar. 

Manon bared her iron teeth, the only bit of her face visible beneath that 
crowned helm. "Four others lie dead inside the castle--at the hand of the 
Fae Prince who came to rescue the king while Z dealt with your unruly 
bitch. Consider yourself lucky, Iskra Yellowlegs, that I do not take that loss 
out of your hide as well." 

Iskra's tan face had gone pale. She surveyed Manon, all of the Thirteen 
assembled. Then she said, "Do what you want with the city. It's yours." A 
flash of a smile as she lifted her hand and pointed at Manon. The Thirteen 
tensed around her, arrows silently drawn and aimed at the Yellowlegs heir. 
"But you, Wing Leader..." That smile grew and she reined her wyvern, 
preparing to take to the skies. "You are a liar, Witch Killer." 

Then she was gone. 

Soaring not for the city, but the skies. 

Within minutes, she'd vanished from sight--sailing toward Morath. 

Toward Manon's grandmother. 


Manon now glanced at Asterin, then at Sorrel, as they slowed to a stop 
before turning the corner that would lead to Erawan's council chamber. 
Where she knew Iskra, and her grandmother, and the other Matrons would 
be waiting. Indeed, a glance around the corner revealed the Thirds and 
Fourths of several covens on guard, eyeing one another as suspiciously as 
the blank-faced men posted beside the double doors. 

Manon said to her Second and Third, "This will be messy." 

Sorrel said quietly, "We'll deal with it." 

Manon clenched the helmet a bit harder. "If it goes poorly, you are to 
take the Thirteen and leave." 

Asterin breathed, "You cannot go in there, Manon, accepting defeat. 
Deny it until your last breath." Whether Sorrel had realized Manon had 
killed that witch to save their enemy, she didn't let on. Asterin demanded, 
"Where would we even go?" 

Manon said, "I don't know or care. But when I am dead, the Thirteen 
will be targeted by anyone with a score to settle." A very, very long list. She 
held her Second's stare. "You get them out. At any cost." 

They glanced at each other. Sorrel said, "We will do as you ask, Wing 
Leader." 

Manon waited--waited for any objection from her Second, but 
Asterin's dark eyes were bright as she bowed her head and murmured her 
agreement. 

A knot in Manon's chest loosened, and she rolled her shoulders once 
before turning away. But Asterin gripped her hand. "Be careful." 

Manon debated snapping to not be a spineless fool, but ... she'd seen 
what her grandmother was capable of. It was carved into Asterin's flesh. 

She would not go into this looking guilty, looking like a liar. No--she'd 
make Iskra crawl by the end. 

So Manon took a solid breath before she resumed her usual storming 
pace, red cape flapping behind her on a phantom wind. 

Everyone stared as they approached. But that was to be expected. 

Manon didn't deign to acknowledge the Thirds and Fourths assembled, 
though she took them in through her peripheral vision. Two young ones 
from Iskra's coven. Six old ones, iron teeth flecked with rust, from the 
covens of the Matrons. And-- 


There were two other young sentinels in the hall, braided bands of dyed 
blue leather upon their brows. 

Petrah Blueblood had come. 

If the heirs and their Matrons were all assembled... 

She did not have room for fear in her husk of a heart. 

Manon flung open the doors, Asterin on her heels, Sorrel falling back to 
join the others in the hall. 

Ten witches turned toward Manon as she entered. Erawan was nowhere 
in sight. 

And though her grandmother was in the center of where they all stood 
in the room, her own Second against the stone wall behind Manon, lined up 
with the four other Seconds gathered, Manon's attention went to the golden- 
haired heir. 

To Petrah. 

She had not seen the Blueblood heir since the day of the War Games, 
when Manon had saved her life from a sure-kill fall. Saved her life, but was 
unable to save the life of Petrah's wyvern--whose throat had been ripped to 
shreds by Iskra's bull. 

The Blueblood heir stood beside her mother, Cresseida, both of them 
tall and thin. A crown of iron stars sat upon the Matron's pale brow, the face 
below unreadable. 

Unlike Petrah's. Caution--warning shone in her deep blue eyes. She 
wore her riding leathers, a cloak of midnight blue hanging from bronze 
clasps at her shoulders, her golden braid snaking over her chest. Petrah had 
always been odd, head in the clouds, but that was the way of the 
Bluebloods. Mystics, fanatics, zealots were among the pleasanter terms 
used to describe them and their worship of the Three-Faced Goddess. 

But there was a hollowness in Petrah's face that had not been there 
months ago. Rumor had claimed that losing her wyvern had broken the heir 
--that she had not gotten out of bed for weeks. 

Witches did not mourn, because witches did not love enough to allow it 
to break them. Even if Asterin, now taking up her place by the Blackbeak 
Matron's Second, had proved otherwise. 

Petrah nodded, a slight dip of the chin--more than a mere 
acknowledgment of an heir to an heir. Manon turned toward her 
grandmother before anyone could notice. 


Her grandmother stood in her voluminous black robes, her dark hair 
plaited over the crown of her head. Like the crown her grandmother sought 
for them--for her and Manon. High Queens of the Wastes, she'd once 
promised Manon. Even if it meant selling out every witch in this room. 

Manon bowed to her grandmother, to the other two Matrons assembled. 

Iskra snarled from beside the Yellowlegs Matron, an ancient, bent- 
backed crone with bits of flesh still in her teeth from lunch. Manon fixed 
the heir with a cool stare as she straightened. 

"Three stand gathered," her grandmother began, and every bone in 
Manon's body went stiff. "Three Matrons, to honor the three faces of our 
Mother." Maiden, Mother, Crone. It was why the Yellowlegs Matron was 
always ancient, why the Blackbeak was always a witch in her prime, and 
why Cresseida, as the Blueblood Matron, still looked young and fresh. 

But Manon did not care about that. Not when the words were being 
spoken. 

"The Crone's Sickle hangs above us," Cresseida intoned. "Let it be the 
Mother's blade of justice." 

This was not a meeting. 

This was a trial. 

Iskra began smiling. 

As if a thread wove between them, Manon could feel Asterin 
straightening behind her, feel her Second readying for the worst. 

"Blood calls for blood," the Yellowlegs crone rasped. "We shall decide 
how much is owed." 

Manon kept still, not daring to show one inch of fear, of trepidation. 

Witch trials were brutal, exact. Usually, problems were settled with the 
three blows to face, ribs, and stomach. Rarely, only in the gravest 
circumstances, did the three Matrons gather to mete out judgment. 

Manon's grandmother said, "You stand accused, Manon Blackbeak, of 
cutting down a Yellowlegs sentinel with no provocation beyond your own 
pride." 

Iskra's eyes positively burned. 

"And, as the sentinel was a part of the Yellowlegs' heir's own coven, it 
is also a crime against Iskra." Her grandmother's face was tight with rage-- 
not for what Manon had done, but for getting caught. "Through either your 
own neglect or ill-planning, the lives of four other coven members were 


ended. Their blood, too, stains your hands." Her grandmother's iron teeth 
shone in the candlelight. "Do you deny these charges?" 

Manon kept her back straight, looked each of them in the eye. "I do not 
deny that I killed Iskra's sentinel when she tried to claim my rightful prize. I 
do not deny that the other four were slaughtered by the Fae Prince. But I do 
deny any wrongdoing on my part." 

Iskra hissed. "You can smell Zelta's blood on her--smell the fear and 
pain." 

Manon sneered, "You smell that, Yellowlegs, because your sentinel had 
a coward's heart and attacked another sister-in-arms. When she realized she 
would not win our fight, it was already too late for her." 

Iskra's face contorted with fury. "Liar--" 

"Tell us, Blackbeak Heir," Cresseida said, "what happened in Rifthold 
three days past." 

So Manon did. 

And for the first time in her century of miserable existence, she lied to 
her elders. She wove a fine tapestry of falsehoods, believing the stories she 
told them. As she finished, she gestured to Iskra Yellowlegs. "It's common 
knowledge the Yellowlegs heir has long coveted my position. Perhaps she 
rushed back here to fling accusations at me so she might steal my place as 
Wing Leader, just as her sentinel tried to steal my prey." 

Iskra bristled but kept her mouth shut. Petrah took a step forward, 
however, and spoke. "I have questions for the Blackbeak heir, if it would 
not be an impertinence." 

Manon's grandmother looked like she'd rather have her own nails 
ripped out, but the other two nodded. 

Manon straightened, bracing herself for whatever Petrah thought she 
was doing. 

Petrah's blue eyes were calm as she met Manon's stare. "Would you 
consider me your enemy or rival?" 

"I consider you an ally when the occasion demands it, but always a 
rival, yes." The first true thing Manon had said. 

"And yet you saved me from sure death at the War Games. Why?" 

The other Matrons glanced at one another, faces unreadable. 

Manon lifted her chin. "Because Keelie fought for you as she died. I 
would not allow her death to be wasted. I could offer a fellow warrior 


nothing less." 

At the sound of her dead wyvern's name, pain flickered across Petrah's 
face. "You remember her name?" 

Manon knew it wasn't an intended question. But she nodded all the 
same. 

Petrah faced the Matrons. "That day, Iskra Yellowlegs nearly killed me, 
and her bull slaughtered my mare." 

"We have dealt with that," Iskra cut in, teeth flashing, "and dismissed it 
as accidental--" 

Petrah held up a hand. "I am not finished, Iskra Yellowlegs." 

Nothing but brutal steel in those words as she addressed the other heir. 
A small part of Manon was glad not to be on the receiving end of it. 

Iskra saw the unfinished business that waited in that tone and backed 
down. 

Petrah lowered her hand. "Manon Blackbeak had the chance to let me 
die that day. The easier choice would have been to let me die, and she 
would not be standing accused as she is now. But she risked her life, and the 
life of her mount, to spare me from death." 

A life debt--that was what lay between them. Did Petrah think to fill it 
by speaking in her favor now? Manon reined in her sneer. 

Petrah went on, "I do not comprehend why Manon Blackbeak would 
save me only to later turn on her Yellowlegs sisters. You crowned her Wing 
Leader for her obedience, discipline, and brutality--do not let the anger of 
Iskra Yellowlegs sully the qualities you saw in her then, and which still 
shine forth today. Do not lose your Wing Leader over a misunderstanding." 

The Matrons again glanced among them as Petrah bowed, backing into 
her place at her mother's right. But the three witches continued that 
unspoken discussion waging between them. Until Manon's grandmother 
stepped forward, the other two falling back--yielding the decision to her. 
Manon almost sagged in relief. 

She'd corner Petrah the next time the heir was foolish enough to be out 
alone, get her to admit why she'd spoken in Manon's favor. 

Her grandmother's black-and-gold gaze was hard. Unforgiving. 

"Petrah Blueblood has spoken true." 

That tense, tight string between Manon and Asterin loosened, too. 

"It would be a waste to lose our obedient, faithful Wing Leader." 


Manon had been beaten before. She could endure her grandmother's 
fists again. 

"Why should the heir of the Blackbeak Witch-Clan yield her life for that 
of a mere sentinel? Wing Leader or not, it is still the word of heir against 
heir in this matter. But the blood has still been shed. And blood must be 
paid." 

Manon again gripped her helm. Her grandmother smiled a little. 

"The blood shed must be equal," her grandmother intoned. Her attention 
flicked over Manon's shoulder. "So you, Granddaughter, will not die for 
this. But one of your Thirteen will." 

For the first time in a long, long while, Manon knew what fear, what 
human helplessness, tasted like as her grandmother said, triumph lighting 
her ancient eyes, "Your Second, Asterin Blackbeak, shall pay the blood debt 
between our clans. She dies at sunrise tomorrow." 


Chapter 11 


Without Evangeline slowing them down, Aelin, Aedion, and Lysandra 
traveled with little rest as they hauled ass for the coast. 

Aelin remained in her Fae form to keep up with Aedion, who she 
begrudgingly admitted was by far the better rider, while Lysandra shifted in 
and out of various bird shapes to scout the land ahead for any danger. 
Rowan had been instructing her on how to do it, what things to note and 
what to avoid or get a closer look at, while they'd been on the road these 
weeks. But Lysandra found little to report from the skies, and Aelin and 
Aedion encountered few dangers on the ground as they crossed the valleys 
and plains of Terrasen's lowlands. 

So little remained of the once-rich territory. 

Aelin tried not to dwell on it too much--on the threadbare estates, the 
abandoned farms, the gaunt-faced people whenever they ventured into 
town, cloaked and disguised, for desperately needed supplies. Though she 
had faced darkness and emerged full of light, a voice whispered in her head, 
You did this, you did this, you did this. 

That voice often sounded like Weylan Darrow's icy tones. 

Aelin left gold pieces in her wake--tucked under a mug of watery tea 
offered to her and Aedion on a stormy morning; dropped in the bread box of 
a farmer who'd given them slices and a bit of meat for Lysandra in falcon 
form; slipped into the coin drawer of an innkeeper who had offered them a 
free extra bowl of stew upon seeing how swiftly they devoured their 
lunches. 

But that gold didn't ease the cracking in her heart--that hideous voice 
that haunted her waking and dreaming thoughts. 

By the time they reached the ancient port town of Ilium a week later, 
she'd stopped leaving gold behind. 


Itd started to feel more like a bribe. Not to her people, who had no 
inkling she'd been among them, but to her own conscience. 

The green flatlands eventually yielded to rocky, arid coastline miles 
before the white-walled town rose between the thrashing turquoise sea and 
the broad mouth of the Florine River snaking inland, all the way to Orynth. 
The town of Ilium was as ancient as Terrasen itself, and would likely have 
already been forgotten by traders and history were it not for the crumbling 
temple at the northeastern edge of the city, drawing enough pilgrims to keep 
it thriving. 

The Temple of the Stone, it was called, had been built around the very 
rock where Brannon had first placed his foot upon the continent before 
sailing up the Florine to its source at the base of the Staghorns. How the 
Little Folk had known how to render the temple for her, she had no idea. 

Ilium's stout, sprawling temple had been erected on a pale cliff with 
commanding views of the storm-worn, pretty town behind it and the endless 
ocean beyond--so blue that it reminded Aelin of the tranquil waters of the 
South. 

Waters where Rowan and Dorian should now be headed, if they were 
lucky. Aelin tried not to dwell on that, either. Without the Fae Prince at her 
side, there was a horrible, endless silence. 

Almost as quiet as the white walls of the town--and the people inside. 
Hooded and armed to the teeth beneath their heavy cloaks, Aelin and 
Aedion rode through the open gates, no more than two cautious pilgrims on 
their way to the temple. Disguised for secrecy--and for the little fact that 
Ilium was now under Adarlanian occupation. 

Lysandra had brought the news that morning after flying ahead, 
lingering in human form only long enough to inform them. 

"We should have gone north to Eldrys," Aedion murmured as they rode 
past a cluster of hard-faced sentries in Adarlanian armor, the soldiers only 
glancing their way to note the sharp-eyed, sharper-beaked falcon perched 
on Aelin's shoulder. None marked the shield hidden amongst Aedion's 
saddlebags, carefully veiled by the folds of his cloak. Or the swords they'd 
both concealed as well. Damaris remained where she'd stored it these 
weeks on the road: strapped beneath the heavy bags containing the ancient 
spellbooks she'd borrowed from Dorian's royal library in Rifthold. "We can 
still turn around." 


Aelin shot him a glare beneath the shadows of her hood. "If you think 
for one moment I'm leaving this city in Adarlan's hands, you can go to 
hell." Lysandra clicked her beak in agreement. 

The Little Folk had not been wrong to send the message to come here, 
their rendering of the temple near-perfect. Through whatever magic they 
possessed, they had foreseen the news long before it ever reached Aelin on 
the road: Rifthold had indeed fallen, its king vanished and the city sacked 
by witches. Emboldened by this, and by the rumor that she was not taking 
back her throne but rather running as well, the Lord of Meah, Roland 
Havilliard's father and one of the most powerful lords in Adarlan, had 
marched his garrison of troops just over the border into Terrasen. And 
claimed this port for himself. 

"Fifty soldiers are camped here," Aedion warned her and Lysandra. 

The shifter only puffed out her feathers as if to say, So? 

His jaw clenched. "Believe me, I want a piece of them, too. But--" 

"I am not hiding in my own kingdom," Aelin cut in. "And I am not 
going to leave without sending a reminder of who this land belongs to." 

Aedion kept quiet as they rounded a corner, aiming for the small seaside 
inn Lysandra had also scouted that morning. On the other side of the city 
from the temple. 

The temple the soldiers had the nerve to use as their barracks. 

"Is this about sending a message to Adarlan, or to Darrow?" Aedion 
asked at last. 

"It is about freeing my people, who have dealt with these Adarlanian 
pieces of shit for too long," Aelin snapped, reining her mare in to a halt 
before the inn courtyard. Lysandra's talons dug into her shoulder in silent 
agreement. Mere feet beyond the weatherworn courtyard wall, the sea 
gleamed sapphire-bright. "We move at nightfall." 

Aedion remained quiet, his face partially hidden as the inn's owner 
scuttled out and they secured a room for the night. Aelin let her cousin 
brood a bit, wrangling her magic under control. She hadn't released any of 
it this morning, wanting it to be at full force for what they were to do 
tonight, but the strain now tugged at her, an itch with no relief, an edge she 
could not dull. 

Only when they were ensconced in their tiny, two-bed chamber, 
Lysandra perched on the windowsill, did Aedion say, "Aelin, you know Pl 


help--you know I want these bastards out of here. But the people of Ilium 
have lived here for centuries, aware that in war, they are the first to be 
attacked." 

And these soldiers could easily return as soon as they left, he didn't 
need to add. 

Lysandra pecked the window--a quiet request. Aelin strode over, 
shoved open the window to let the sea breeze flit in. "Symbols have power, 
Aedion," she said, watching the shifter fan her speckled wings. She'd read 
books and books on it during that ridiculous competition in Rifthold. 

He snorted. "I know. Believe me--I've wielded them to my advantage 
as often as I can." He patted the bone pommel of the Sword of Orynth for 
emphasis. "Come to think of it, I said the same exact thing once to Dorian 
and Chaol." He shook his head at the memory. 

Aelin just leaned against the windowsill. "Ilium used to be the 
stronghold of the Mycenians." 

"The Mycenians are nothing more than a myth--they were banished 
three hundred years ago. If you're looking for a symbol, they're fairly 
outdated--and divisive." 

She knew that. The Mycenians had once ruled Ilium not as nobility, but 
crime lords. And during some long-ago war, their lethal fleet had been so 
crucial in winning that they'd been turned legitimate by whatever king ruled 
at the time. Until they had been exiled centuries later for their refusal to 
come to Terrasen's aid in another war. 

She met Lysandra's green-eyed stare as the shifter lowered her wings, 
sufficiently cooled. She'd been distant on the road this week, preferring 
feathers or fur to skin. Perhaps because some piece of her heart now rode 
for Orynth with Ren and Murtaugh. Aelin stroked her friend's silken head. 
"The Mycenians abandoned Terrasen so they would not die in a war they 
did not believe in." 

"And they disbanded and vanished soon after that, never to be seen 
again,' Aedion countered. "What's your point? You think liberating Ilium 
will summon them again? They're long gone, Aelin, their sea dragons with 
them." 

Indeed, there was no sign anywhere in this city of the legendary fleet 
and warriors who had sailed to wars across distant, violent seas, who had 
defended these borders with their own blood spilled upon the waves beyond 


the windows. And the blood of their sea dragons, both allies and weapons. 
Only when the last of the dragons had died, heartsick to be banished from 
Terrasen's waters, had the Mycenians truly been lost. And only when the 
sea dragons returned would the Mycenians, too, come home. Or so their 
ancient prophecies claimed. 

Aedion began removing the extra blades hidden in their saddlebags, 
save for Damaris, and strapped them on, one by one. He double-checked 
that Rowan's knife was securely buckled at his side before he said to Aelin 
and Lysandra, still by the window, "I know you two are of the opinion that 
we males are here to provide you with a pretty view and meals, but I am a 
general of Terrasen. We need to find a real army--not spend our time 
chasing ghosts. If we don't get a host to the North by mid-fall, the winter 
storms will keep it away by land and sea." 

"If you're so versed in symbols wielding such power, Aedion," she said, 
"then you know why Ilium is vital. We can't allow Adarlan to hold it. For a 
dozen reasons." She was certain her cousin had already calculated all of 
them. 

"So take back the town," Aedion challenged. "But we need to sail by 
dawn." Her cousin's eyes narrowed. "The temple. It's also that they took the 
temple, isn't it?" 

"That temple is my birthright," Aelin said. "I cannot allow that insult to 
go unchecked." She rolled her shoulders. Revealing her plans, explaining 
herself ... It would take some getting used to. But she'd promised she'd try 
to be more ... open about her plotting. And for this matter, at least, she 
could be. "Both for Adarlan and for Darrow. Not if I am to one day reclaim 
my throne." 

Aedion considered. Then snorted, a hint of a smile on his face. "An 
undisputed queen of not just blood, but also of legends." His face remained 
contemplative. "You would be the undisputed queen if you got the 
kingsflame to bloom again." 

"Too bad Lysandra can only shift herself and not things," Aelin 
muttered. Lysandra clicked her beak in agreement, puffing her feathers. 

"They say the kingsflame bloomed once during Orlon's reign," Aedion 
mused. "Just one blossom, found in Oakwald." 

"I know," Aelin said quietly. "He kept it pressed within glass on his 
desk." She still remembered that small red-and-orange flower, so simple in 


its make, but so vibrant it had always snatched her breath away. It had 
bloomed in fields and across mountains throughout the kingdom the day 
Brannon set foot on this continent. And for centuries afterward, if a solitary 
blossom was ever found, the current sovereign was deemed blessed, the 
kingdom truly at peace. 

Before the flower was found in Orlon's second decade of kingship, the 
last one had been spotted ninety-five years earlier. Aelin swallowed hard. 
"Did Adarlan--" 

"Darrow has it," Aedion said. "It was the only thing of Orlon's he 
managed to grab before the soldiers took the palace." 

Aelin nodded, her magic flickering in answer. Even the Sword of 
Orynth had fallen into Adarlan's hands--auntil Aedion had won it back. Yes, 
her cousin understood perhaps more than anyone else the power a single 
symbol could wield. How the loss or reclaiming of one could shatter or 
rally an army, a people. 

Enough--it was enough destruction and pain inflicted on her kingdom. 

"Come on," she said to Lysandra and Aedion, heading for the door. 
"We'd better eat before we raise hell." 


Chapter 12


It had been a long while since Dorian had seen so many stars. 

Far behind them, smoke still stained the sky, the plumes illuminated by 
the crescent moon overhead. At least the screams had faded miles ago. 
Along with the thump of mighty wings. 

Seated behind him in the one-masted skiff, Prince Rowan Whitethorn 
gazed over the calm black expanse of the sea. They'd sail south, pushed by 
the prince's own magic, to the Dead Islands. The Fae warrior had gotten 
them quickly to the coast, where he'd had no qualms about stealing this 
boat while its owner was focused on the panicking city to the west. And all 
the while, Dorian had been silent, useless. As he had been while his city 
was destroyed, his people murdered. 

"You should eat," Rowan said from the other end of the small boat. 

Dorian glanced toward the sack of supplies Rowan had also stolen. 
Bread, cheese, apples, dried fish ... Dorian's stomach turned. 

"You were impaled by a poisoned barb," Rowan said, his voice no 
louder than the waves lapping against their boat as the swift wind pushed 
them from behind. "Your magic was drained keeping you alive and 
walking. You need to eat, or else it won't replenish." A pause. "Didn't 
Aelin warn you about that?" 

Dorian swallowed. "No. She didn't really have the time to teach me 
about magic." He looked toward the back of the boat, where Rowan sat 
with a hand braced on the rudder. The sight of those pointed ears was still a 
shock, even months after meeting the male. And that silver hair-- 

Not like Manon's hair, which was the pure white of moonlight on snow. 

He wondered what had become of the Wing Leader--who had killed for 
him, spared him. 

Not spared him. Rescued him. 


He wasn't a fool. He knew she'd done it for whatever reasons were 
useful to her. She was as alien to him as the warrior sitting at the other end 
of the boat--more so. 

And yet, that darkness, that violence and stark, honest way of looking at 
the world ... There would be no secrets with her. No lies. 

"You need to eat to keep up your strength," Rowan went on. "Your 
magic feeds on your energy--feeds on you. The more rested you are, the 
greater the strength. More important, the greater the control. Your power is 
both part of you and its own entity. If left to its own devices, it will 
consume you, wield you like a tool." A flash of teeth as Rowan smiled. "A 
certain person we know likes to siphon off her power, use it on frivolous 
things to keep its edge dull." Dorian could feel Rowan's stare pin him like a 
physical blow. "The choice is yours how much you allow it into your life, 
how to use it--but go any longer without mastering it, Majesty, and it will 
destroy you." 

A chill went down Dorian's spine. 

And maybe it was the open ocean, or the endless stars above them, but 
Dorian said, "It wasn't enough. That day ... that day Sorscha died, it wasn't 
enough to save her." He spread his hands on his lap. "It only wishes to 
destroy." 

Silence fell, long enough that Dorian wondered if Rowan had fallen 
asleep. He hadn't dared ask when the prince himself had last slept; he'd 
certainly eaten enough for a starved man. 

"I was not there to save my mate when she was murdered, either," 
Rowan said at last. 

Dorian straightened. Aelin had told him plenty of the prince's history, 
but not this. He supposed it wasn't her secret, her sorrow to share. "I'm 
sorry," Dorian said. 

His magic had felt the bond between Aelin and Rowan--the bond that 
went deeper than blood, than their magic, and he'd assumed it was just that 
they were mates, and hadn't announced it to anyone. But if Rowan already 
had a mate, and had lost her... 

Rowan said, "You're going to hate the world, Dorian. You are going to 
hate yourself. You will hate your magic, and you will hate any moment of 
peace or happiness. But I had the luxury of a kingdom at peace and no one 
depending upon me. You do not." 





Rowan shifted the rudder, adjusting their course farther out to sea as the 
coastline jutted to meet them, a rising wall of steep cliffs. He'd known they 
were traveling swiftly, but they had to be almost halfway to the southern 
border--and traveling far faster than he'd realized under the cover of 
darkness. 

Dorian said at last, "I am the sovereign of a broken kingdom. My people 
do not know who rules them. And now that I am fleeing..." He shook his 
head, exhaustion gnawing on his bones. "Have I yielded my kingdom to 
Erawan? What--what do I even do from here?" 

The ship's creaking and the rush of water were the only sounds. "Your 
people will have learned by now that you were not among the dead. It is 
upon you to tell them how to interpret it--if they are to see you as 
abandoning them, or if they are to see you as a man who is leaving to find 
help--to save them. You must make that clear." 

"By going to the Dead Islands." 

A nod. "Aelin, unsurprisingly, has a fraught history with the Pirate 
Lord. You don't. It's in your best interest to make him see you as an 
advantageous ally. Aedion told me the Dead Islands were once overrun by 
General Narrok and several of Erawan's forces. Rolfe and his fleet fled-- 
and though Rolfe is now once more ruler of Skull's Bay, that disgrace might 
be your way in with him. Convince him you are not your father's son--and 
that you'll grant Rolfe and his pirates privileges." 

"You mean turn them into privateers." 

"You have gold, we have gold. If promising Rolfe money and free rein 
to loot Erawan's ships will secure us an armada in the South, we'd be fools 
to shy from it." 

Dorian considered the prince's words. "I've never met a pirate." 

"You met Aelin when she was still pretending to be Celaena," Rowan 
said drily. "I can promise you Rolfe won't be much worse." 

"That's not reassuring." 

A huffed laugh. Silence fell between them again. At last, Rowan said, 
"I'm sorry--about Sorscha." 

Dorian shrugged, and hated himself for the gesture, as if it diminished 
what Sorscha had meant, how brave she'd been--how special. "You know," 
he said, "sometimes I wish Chaol were here--to help me. And then 
sometimes I'm glad he's not, so he wouldn't be at risk again. I'm glad he's 





in Antica with Nesryn." He studied the prince, the lethal lines of his body, 
the predatory stillness with which he sat, even as he manned their boat. 
"Could you--could you teach me about magic? Not everything, I mean, but 
... what you can, whenever we can." 

Rowan considered for a moment, and then said, "I have known many 
kings in my life, Dorian Havilliard. And it was a rare man indeed who 
asked for help when he needed it, who would put aside pride." 

Dorian was fairly certain his pride had been shredded under the claws of 
the Valg prince. 

"PII teach you as much as I can before we arrive in Skull's Bay," 
Rowan said. "We may find someone there who escaped the butchers-- 
someone to instruct you more than I can." 

"You taught Aelin." 

Again, silence. Then, "Aelin is my heart. I taught her what I knew, and 
it worked because our magics understood each other deep down--yjust as 
our souls did. You are ... different. Your magic is something I have rarely 
encountered. You need someone who grasps it, or at least how to train you 
in it. But I can teach you control; I can teach you about spiraling down into 
your power, and taking care of yourself." 

Dorian nodded his thanks. "The first time you met Aelin, did you know 

A snort. "No. Gods, no. We wanted to kill each other." The amusement 
flickered. "She was ... in a very dark place. We both were. But we led each 
other out of it. Found a way--together." 

For a heartbeat, Dorian could only stare. As if reading his mind, Rowan 
said, "You will find your way, too, Dorian. Yov'll find your way out." 

He didn't have the right words to convey what was in his heart, so he 
sighed up at the starry, endless sky. "To Skull's Bay, then." 

Rowan's smile was a slash of white in the darkness. "To Skull's Bay." 


Chapter 13


Clothed in battle-black from head to toe, Aedion Ashryver kept to the 
shadows of the street across from the temple and watched his cousin scale 
the building beside him. 

They'd already secured passage on a ship for tomorrow morning, along 
with another messenger ship to sail to Wendlyn, bearing letters beseeching 
the Ashryvers for aid and signed by both Aelin and Aedion himself. 
Because what they'd learned today... 

He'd been to Ilium enough times over the past decade to know his way 
around. Usually, he and his Bane had camped outside the town walls and 
enjoyed themselves so thoroughly at the taverns that he'd wound up puking 
in his own helmet the next morning. A far cry from the stunned silence as 
he and Aelin had walked down the pale, dusty streets, disguised and 
unsociable. 

In all those visits to the town, he'd never imagined traversing these 
streets with his queen--or that her face would be so grave as she took in the 
frightened, unhappy people, the scars of war. 

No flowers thrown in their path, no trumpets singing their return. Just 
the crash of the sea, the howl of the wind, and the beating sun overhead. 
And the rage rippling off Aelin at the sight of the soldiers stationed around 
the town... 

All strangers were watched enough that they'd had to be careful about 
securing their ship. To the town, the world, they'd be boarding the Summer 
Lady at midmorning, heading north to Suria. But they would instead be 
sneaking onto the Wind-Singer just before sunrise to sail south come dawn. 
They'd paid in gold for the captain's silence. 

And for his information. They had been about to leave the man's cabin 
when he'd said, "My brother is a merchant. He specializes in goods from 


distant lands. He brought me news last week that ships were spotted 
rallying along the western coast of the Fae territory." 

Aelin had asked, "To sail here?" at the same time Aedion had 
demanded, "How many ships?" 

"Fifty--all warships," the captain had said, looking them over carefully. 
No doubt assuming they were agents of one of the many crowns at play in 
this war. "An army of Fae warriors camped on the beach beyond. They 
seemed to be waiting for the order to sail." 

The news would likely spread fast. Panic the people. Aedion had made 
a note to send warning to his Second to brace the Bane for it--and counter 
any wild rumors. 

Aelin's face had gone a bit bloodless, and he'd braced a steadying hand 
between her shoulder blades. But she had only stood straighter at his touch 
and asked the captain, "Did your brother get the sense that Queen Maeve 
has allied with Morath, or that she is coming to assist Terrasen?" 

"Neither," the captain had cut in. "He was only sailing past, though if 
the armada was out like that, I doubt it was secret. We know nothing else-- 
perhaps the ships were for another war." 

His queen's face yielded nothing in the dimness of her hood. Aedion 
made his do the same. 

Except her face had remained like that the entire walk back, and in the 
hours since, when they'd honed their weapons and then slipped back onto 
the streets under cover of darkness. If Maeve was indeed rallying an army 
to stand against them... 

Aelin paused atop the roof, Goldryn's bright hilt wrapped in cloth to 
hide its gleaming, and Aedion glanced between her shadowy figure and the 
Adarlan watch patrolling the temple walls mere feet below. 

But his cousin turned her head toward the nearby ocean, as if she could 
see all the way to Maeve and her awaiting fleet. If the immortal bitch allied 
with Morath ... Surely Maeve would not be so stupid. Perhaps the two dark 
rulers would destroy each other in their bid for power. And likely destroy 
this continent in the process. 

But a Dark King and a Dark Queen united against the Fire-Bringer... 

They had to act quickly. Cut off one snake's head before dealing with 
the other. 


Cloth on skin hissed, and Aedion glanced at where Lysandra waited 
behind him, on the lookout for Aelin's signal. She was in her traveling 
clothes--a bit worn and dirty. She'd been reading an ancient-looking book 
all afternoon. Forgotten Creatures of the Deep or whatever it had been 
called. A smile tugged at his lips as he wondered whether she'd borrowed 
or stolen the title. 

The lady looked to where Aelin still stood on the roof, no more than a 
shadow. Lysandra cleared her throat a bit and said too softly for anyone to 
hear, either the queen or the soldiers across the street, "She's accepted 
Darrow's decree too calmly." 

"Td hardly call any of this calm." But he knew what the shifter meant. 
Since Rowan had gone, since word of Rifthold's fall had arrived, Aelin had 
been half present. Distant. 

Lysandra's pale green eyes pinned him to the spot. "It's the calm before 
the storm, Aedion." 

Every one of his predatory instincts perked. 

Lysandra's eyes again drifted to Aelin's lithe figure. "A storm is 
coming. A great storm." 

Not the forces lurking in Morath, not Darrow plotting in Orynth or 
Maeve assembling her armada--but the woman on that roof, hands braced 
on the edge as she crouched down. 

"You're not frightened of ... ?" He couldn't say the rest. He'd somehow 
grown accustomed to having the shifter guard Aelin's back--had found the 
idea mighty appealing. Rowan at her right, Aedion at her left, Lysandra at 
her back: nothing and no one would get to their queen. 

"No--no, never," Lysandra said. Something eased in his chest. "But the 
more I think about it, the more ... the more it seems like this was all 
planned, laid out long ago. Erawan had decades before Aelin was born to 
strike--decades during which no one with her powers, or Dorian's powers, 
existed to challenge him. Yet, as fate or fortune would have it, he moves 
now. At a time when a Fire-Bringer walks the earth." 

"What are you getting at?" He'd considered all this before, during those 
long watches on the road. It was all horrifying, impossible, but--so much of 
their lives defied logic or normalcy. The shifter next to him proved that. 

"Morath is unleashing its horrors," Lysandra said. "Maeve stirs across 
the sea. Two goddesses walk hand in hand with Aelin. More than that, Mala 


and Deanna have watched over her the entirety of her life. But perhaps it 
wasn't watching. Perhaps it was ... shaping. So they might one day unleash 
her, too. And I wonder if the gods have weighed the costs of that storm. 
And deemed the casualties worth it." 

A chill snaked down his spine. 

Lysandra went on, so quietly that Aedion wondered if she feared not the 
queen hearing, but those gods. "We have yet to see the full extent of 
Erawan's darkness. And I think we have yet to see the full extent of Aelin's 
fire." 

"She's not some unwitting pawn." He'd defy the gods, find a way to 
slaughter them, if they threatened Aelin, if they deemed these lands a 
worthy sacrifice to defeat the Dark King. 

"Is it really that hard for you to just agree with me for once?" 

"I never disagree." 

"You always have an answer to everything." She shook her head. "It's 
insufferable." 

Aedion grinned. "Good to know I'm finally getting under your skin. Or 
is it skins?" 

That staggeringly beautiful face turned positively wicked. "Careful, 
Aedion. I bite." 

Aedion leaned in a bit closer. He knew there were lines with Lysandra-- 
knew there were boundaries he wouldn't cross, wouldn't push at. Not after 
what she'd endured since childhood, not after she'd regained her freedom. 
Not after what he'd been through, too. 

Even if he hadn't yet told Aelin about it. How could he? How could he 
explain what had been done to him, what he'd been forced to do in those 
early years of conquest? 

But flirting with Lysandra was harmless--for both him and the shifter. 
And gods, it was good to talk to her for more than a minute between forms. 
So he snapped his teeth at her and said, "Good thing I know how to make 
women purr." 

She laughed softly, but the sound died as she looked toward their queen 
again, the sea breeze shifting her dark silken hair. "Any minute now," she 
warned him. 

Aedion didn't give a shit what Darrow thought, what he sneered about. 
Lysandra had saved his life--had fought for their queen and put everything 


on the line, including her ward, to rescue him from execution and reunite 
him with Aelin. He'd seen how often the shifter's eyes had darted behind 
them the first few days--as if she could see Evangeline with Murtaugh and 
Ren. He knew even now part of her remained with the girl, just as part of 
Aelin remained with Rowan. He wondered if he'd ever feel it--that degree 
of love. 

For Aelin, yes--but ... it was a part of him, as his limbs were a part of 
him. It had never been a choice, as Lysandra's selflessness with that little 
girl had been, as Rowan and Aelin had chosen each other. Perhaps it was 
stupid to consider, given what he'd been trained to do and what awaited 
them in Morath, but ... He'd never tell her this in a thousand years, but 
looking at Aelin and Rowan, he sometimes envied them. 

He didn't even want to think about what else Darrow had implied--that 
a union between Wendlyn and Terrasen had been attempted over ten years 
ago, with marriage between him and Aelin the asking price, only to be 
rejected by their kin across the sea. 

He loved his cousin, but the thought of touching her like that made his 
stomach turn. He had a feeling she returned the sentiment. 

She hadn't shown him the letter she'd written to Wendlyn. It hadn't 
occurred to him until now to ask to see it. Aedion stared up at the lone 
figure before the vast, dark sea. 

And realized he didn't want to know. 

He was a general, a warrior honed by blood and rage and loss; he had 
seen and done things that still drew him from his sleep, night after night, 
but ... He did not want to know. Not yet. 

Lysandra said, "We should leave before dawn. I don't like the smell of 
this place." 

He inclined his head toward the fifty soldiers camped inside the temple 
walls. "Obviously." 

But before she could speak, blue flames sparked at Aelin's fingertips. 
The signal. 

Lysandra shifted into a ghost leopard, and Aedion faded into the 
shadows as she loosed a roar that set the nearby homes tumbling awake. 
People spilled out of their doors just as the soldiers threw open the gates to 
the temple to see what the commotion was about. 


Aelin was off the roof in a few nimble maneuvers, landing with feline 
grace as the soldiers shoved into the street, weapons out and eyes wide. 

Those eyes grew wider as Lysandra slunk up beside Aelin, snarling. As 
Aedion fell into step on her other side. Together, they pulled off their hoods. 
Someone gasped behind them. 

Not at their golden hair, their faces. But at the hand wreathed in blue 
flame as Aelin lifted it above her head and said to the soldiers pointing 
crossbows at them, "Get the hell out of my temple." 

The soldiers blinked. One of the townsfolk behind them began weeping 
as a crown of fire appeared atop Aelin's hair. As the cloth smothering 
Goldryn burned away and the ruby glowed bloodred. 

Aedion smiled at the Adarlanian bastards, unhooked his shield from 
across his back, and said, "My lady gives you a choice: leave now ... or 
never leave at all." 

The soldiers exchanged glances. The flame around Aelin's head burned 
brighter, a beacon in the dark. Symbols have power indeed. 

There she was, crowned in flame, a bastion against the gathered night. 
So Aedion drew the Sword of Orynth from its sheath along his spine. 
Someone cried out at the sight of that ancient, mighty blade. 

More and more soldiers filled the open temple courtyard beyond the 
gate. And some dropped their weapons outright, lifting their hands. Backing 
away. 

"You bleeding cowards," a soldier snarled, shoving to the front. A 
commander, from the decorations on his red-and-gold uniform. Human. No 
black rings on any of them. His lip curled as he beheld Aedion, the shield 
and sword he held angled and ready for bloodletting. "The Wolf of the 
North." The sneer deepened. "And the fire-breathing bitch herself." 

Aelin, to her credit, only looked bored. And she said one last time to the 
human soldiers gathered there, shifting on their feet, "Live or die; it's your 
choice. But make it now." 

"Don't listen to the bitch," the commander snapped. "Simple parlor 
tricks, Lord Meah said." 

But five more soldiers dropped their weapons and ran. Outright sprinted 
into the streets. "Anyone else?" Aelin asked softly. 

Thirty-five soldiers remained, weapons out, faces hard. Aedion had 
fought against and alongside such men. Aelin looked to him in question. 


Aedion nodded. The commander had his claws in them--they would only 
retreat when the man did. 

"Come on, then. Let's see what you have to offer," the commander 
taunted. "I've got a lovely farmer's daughter I want to finish--" 

As if she were blowing out a candle, Aelin exhaled a breath toward the 
man. 

First the commander went quiet. As if every thought, every feeling had 
halted. Then his body seemed to stiffen, like he'd been turned to stone. 

And for a heartbeat, Aedion thought the man had been turned to stone 
as his skin, his Adarlanian uniform, turned varying shades of gray. 

But as the sea breeze brushed past, and the man simply fell apart into 
nothing but ashes, Aedion realized with no small amount of shock what she 
had done. 

She'd burned him alive. From the inside out. Someone screamed. 

Aelin merely said, "I warned you." A few soldiers now bolted. 

But most held their ground, hate and disgust shining in their eyes at the 
magic, at his queen--at him. 

And Aedion smiled like the wolf he was as he lifted the Sword of 
Orynth and unleashed himself upon the line of soldiers raising weapons on 
the left, Lysandra lunging to the right with a guttural snarl, and Aelin rained 
down flames of gold and ruby upon the world. 


They took back the temple in twenty minutes. 

It was only ten before they had control of it, the soldiers either dead or, 
if they'd surrendered, hauled to the town dungeon by the men and women 
who had joined the fight. The other ten minutes were spent scouring the 
place for any ambushers. But they found only their trappings and refuse, 
and the sight of the temple in such disrepair, the sacred walls carved with 
the names of Adarlanian brutes, the ancient urns of never-ending fire 
extinguished or used for chamber pots... 

Aelin had let them all see when she sent a razing fire through the place, 
gobbling up any trace of those soldiers, removing years of dirt and dust and 
gull droppings to reveal the glorious, ancient carvings beneath, etched into 
every pillar and step and wall. 


The temple complex comprised three buildings around a massive 
courtyard: the archives, the residence for the long-dead priestesses, and the 
temple proper, where the ancient Rock was held. It was in the archives, the 
most defensible area by far, that she left Aedion and Lysandra to find 
anything suitable for bedding, a wall of flame now encompassing the entire 
site. 

Aedion's eyes still shone with the thrill of battle when she claimed she 
wanted a moment alone by the Rock. He'd fought beautifully--and she'd 
made sure to leave some men alive for him to take down. She was not the 
only symbol here tonight, not the only one watched. 

And as for the shifter who had ripped into those soldiers with such feral 
savagery ... Aelin left her again in falcon form, perched on a rotting beam 
in the cavernous archives, staring at the enormous rendering of a sea dragon 
carved into the floor, at last revealed by that razing fire. One of many 
similar carvings throughout, the heritage of a people long since exiled. 

From every space inside the temple, the crashing of waves on the shore 
far below whispered or roared. There was nothing to absorb the sound, to 
soften it. Great, sprawling rooms and courtyards where there should have 
been altars and statues and gardens of reflection were wholly empty, the 
smoke of her fire still lingering. 

Good. Fire could destroy--but also cleanse. 

She crept across the darkened temple-complex grounds to where the 
innermost, holiest of sanctuaries sprawled to the lip of the sea. Golden light 
leaked onto the rocky ground before the inner sanctum's steps--light from 
the now-eternally-burning vats of flame to honor Brannon's gift. 

Still clothed in black, Aelin was little more than a shadow as she 
dimmed those fires to sleepy, murmuring embers and entered the heart of 
the temple. 

A great sea wall had been built to push back the wrath of storms from 
the stone itself, but even then, the space was damp, the air thick with brine. 

Aelin cleared the massive antechamber and strode between the two fat 
pillars that framed the inner sanctuary. At its far end, open to the wrath of 
the sea beyond, arose the massive black Rock. 

It was smooth as glass, no doubt from the reverent hands that had 
touched it over the millennia, and perhaps as big as a farmer's market 
wagon. It jutted upward, overhanging the sea, and starlight bounced off its 


pocked surface as Aelin extinguished every flame but the sole white candle 
fluttering in the center of the Rock. 

The temple carvings revealed no Wyrdmarks or further messages from 
the Little Folk. Just swirls and stags. 

She'd have to do this the old-fashioned way, then. 

Aelin mounted the small stairs that allowed pilgrims to gaze upon the 
sacred Rock--then stepped onto it. 


Chapter 14


The sea seemed to pause. 

Aelin tugged the Wyrdkey from her jacket, letting it rest between her 
breasts as she took a seat on the overhanging lip of the stone and peered out 
into the night-veiled sea. 

And waited. 

The sliver of crescent moon was beginning to descend when a deep 
male voice said behind her, "You look younger than I thought." 

Aelin stared at the sea, even as her stomach tightened. "But just as 
good-looking, right?" 

She did not hear any footsteps, but the voice was definitely closer as he 
said, "At least my daughter was right about your humility." 

"Funny, she never implied you had a sense of humor." 

A whisper of wind to her right, then long, muscled legs beneath ancient 
armor appeared beside hers, sandaled feet dangling into the surf. She finally 
dared to turn her head, finding that armor continued to a powerful male 
body and a broad-boned, handsome face. He might have fooled anyone into 
thinking he was flesh and blood--were it not for the pale glimmer of blue 
light along his edges. 

Aelin bowed her head slightly to Brannon. 

A half smile was his only acknowledgment, his red-gold hair shifting in 
the moonlight. "A brutal but efficient battle," he said. 

She shrugged. "I was told to come to this temple. I found it occupied. 
So I unoccupied it. You're welcome." 

His lips twitched toward a smile. "I cannot stay long." 

"But you're going to manage to cram in as many cryptic warnings as 
you can, right?" 

Brannon's brows rose, his brandy-colored eyes crinkling with 
amusement. "I had my friends send you a message to come for a reason, 


you know." 

"Oh, I'm sure of it." She wouldn't have risked reclaiming the temple 
otherwise. "But first tell me about Maeve." She'd had enough of waiting 
until they dumped their message into her lap. She had her own gods- 
damned questions. 

Brannon's mouth tightened. "Specify what you need to know." 

"Can she be killed?" 

The king's head whipped toward her. "She is old, Heir of Terrasen. She 
was old when I was a child. Her plans are far-reaching--" 

"I know, I know. But will she die if I shove a blade into her heart? Cut 
off her head?" 

A pause. "I don't know." 

"What?" 

Brannon shook his head. "I don't know. All Fae may be killed, yet she 
has outlived even our extended life spans, and her power ... no one really 
understands her power." 

"But you journeyed with her to get the keys back--" 

"I do not know. But she long feared my flame. And yours." 

"She's not Valg, is she?" 

A low laugh. "No. As cold as one, but no." Brannon's edges began to 
blur a bit. 

But he saw the question in her eyes and nodded for her to go on. 

Aelin swallowed, her jaw clenching a bit as she forced out a breath. 
"Does the power ever get easier to handle?" 

Brannon's gaze softened a fraction. "Yes and no. How it impacts your 
relationships with those around you becomes harder than managing the 
power--yet is tied to it as well. Magic is no easy gift in any form, yet fire 
... We burn not just within our magic, but also in our very souls. For better 
or worse." His attention flicked to Goldryn, peeking over her shoulder, and 
he laughed in quiet surprise. "Is the beast in the cave dead?" 

"No, but he told me that he misses you and you should pay him a visit. 
He's lonely out there." 

Brannon chuckled again. "We would have had fun together, you and I." 

"I'm starting to wish they'd sent you to deal with me instead of your 
daughter. The sense of humor must skip a generation." 


Perhaps it was the wrong thing to say. For that sense of humor instantly 
faded from that beautiful tan face, those brandy eyes going cold and hard. 
Brannon gripped her hand, but his fingers went through hers--right down 
to the stone itself. "The Lock, Heir of Terrasen. I summoned you here for it. 
In the Stone Marshes, there lies a sunken city--the Lock is hidden there. It 
is needed to bind the keys back into the broken Wyrdgate. It is the only way 
to get them back into that gate and seal it permanently. My daughter begs 
you--" 

"What Lock--" 

"Find the Lock." 

"Where in the Stone Marshes? It's not exactly a small--" 

Brannon was gone. 

Aelin scowled and shoved the Amulet of Orynth back into her shirt. "Of 
course there's a gods-damned lock," she muttered. 

She groaned a bit as she eased to her feet, and frowned at the night-dark 
sea crashing mere yards away. At the ancient queen across it, readying her 
armada. 

Aelin stuck out her tongue. 

"Well, if Maeve wasn't already poised to attack, that'll certainly set her 
off," Aedion drawled from the shadows of a nearby pillar. 

Aelin stiffened, hissing. 

Her cousin grinned at her, his teeth moon white. "You think I didn't 
know you had something else up your sleeve for why we took back this 
temple? Or that this spring in Rifthold taught me nothing about your 
tendency to be planning a few things at once?" 

She rolled her eyes, stepping off the sacred stone and stomping down 
the stairs. "I assume you heard everything." 

"Brannon even winked at me before he vanished." 

She clenched her jaw. 

Aedion leaned his shoulder against the carved pillar. "A Lock, eh? And 
when, precisely, were you going to inform us about this new shift in 
direction?" 

She stalked up to him. "When I rutting felt like it, that's when. And it's 
not a shift in direction--not yet. Allies remain our goal, not cryptic 
commands from dead royals." 





Aedion just smiled. A ripple in the murky shadows of the temple 
snagged her attention, and Aelin heaved a sigh. "You two are honestly 
insufferable." 

Lysandra flapped onto the top of a nearby statue and clicked her beak 
rather saucily. 

Aedion slid an arm around Aelin's shoulders, guiding her back toward 
the ramshackle residence within the compound. "New court, new traditions, 
you said. Even for you. Starting with fewer schemes and secrets that take 
years off my life every time you do a grand reveal. Though I certainly 
enjoyed that new trick with the ash. Very artistic." 

Aelin jabbed him in the side. "Do not--" 

The words halted as footsteps crunched on the dry earth from the nearby 
courtyard. The wind drifted by, carrying a scent they knew too well. 

Valg. A powerful one, if he'd walked through her wall of flame. 

Aelin drew Goldryn as Aedion's own blade whined softly, the Sword of 
Orynth gleaming like freshly forged steel in the moonlight. Lysandra 
remained aloft, ducking deeper into the shadows. 

"Sold out or shit-poor luck?" Aedion murmured. 

"Likely both," Aelin muttered back as the figure appeared through two 
pillars. 

He was stocky, slightly overweight--not at all the impossible beauty 
that the Valg princes preferred when inhabiting a human body. But the 
inhuman reek, even with that collar on his wide neck ... So much stronger 
than usual. 

Of course, Brannon couldn't have been bothered to warn her. 

The Valg stepped into the light of the sacred braziers. 

The thoughts eddied from her head as she saw his face. 

And Aelin knew that Aedion had been right: her actions tonight had 
sent a message. An outright declaration of her location. Erawan had been 
waiting for this meeting far longer than a few hours. And the Valg king 
knew both sides of her history. 

For it was the Chief Overseer of Endovier who now grinned at them. 


She still dreamt of him. 


Of that ruddy, common face leering at her, at the other women in 
Endovier. Of his laughter when she was stripped to the waist and whipped 
in the open, then left to hang from her shackles in the bitter cold or blazing 
sun. Of his smile as she was shoved into those lightless pits; the grin still 
stretching wide when they removed her from them days or weeks later. 

Goldryn's hilt became slimy in her hand. Flame instantly burned along 
the fingers of her other. She cursed Lorcan for stealing back the golden ring, 
for taking away that one bit of immunity, of redemption. 

Aedion was glancing between them, reading the recognition in her eyes. 

The Overseer of Endovier sneered at her, "Aren't you going to 
introduce us, slave?" 

The utter stillness that crept over her cousin's face told her enough 
about what he'd pieced together--along with the glance at the faint scars on 
her wrists where shackles had been. 

Aedion slid a step between them, no doubt reading every sound and 
shadow and scent to see if the man was alone, estimating how hard and long 
they'd have to fight their way out of here. Lysandra flapped to another 
pillar, poised to shift and pounce at a single word. 

Aelin tried to rally the swagger that had shielded and bluffed her way 
out of everything. But all she saw was the man dragging those women 
behind the buildings; all she heard was the slam of that iron grate over her 
lightless pit; all she smelled were the salt and the blood and the unwashed 
bodies; all she felt was the burning, wet slide of blood down her ravaged 
back-- 

I will not be afraid; I will not be afraid-- 

"Have they run out of pretty boys in the kingdoms for you to wear?" 
Aedion drawled, buying them time to figure out the odds. 

"Come a bit closer," the overseer smirked, "and we'll see if you make a 
better fit, General." 

Aedion let out a low chuckle, the Sword of Orynth lifting a bit higher. "I 
don't think you'd walk away from it." 

And it was the sight of that blade, her father's blade, the blade of her 
people... 

Aelin lifted her chin, and the flames encircling her left hand flickered 
brighter. 


The overseer's watery blue eyes slid to hers, narrowing with 
amusement. "Too bad you didn't have that little gift when I put you in those 
pits. Or when I painted the earth with your blood." 

A low snarl was Aedion's answer. 

But Aelin made herself smile. "It's late. I just trounced your soldiers. 
Let's get this chat out of the way so I can have some rest." 

The overseer's lip curled. "You'll learn proper manners soon enough, 
girl. All of you will." 

The amulet between her breasts seemed to grumble, a flicker of raw, 
ancient power. 

Aelin ignored it, shutting out any thought of it. If the Valg, if Erawan, 
got one whiff that she possessed what he so desperately sought-- 

The overseer again opened his mouth. She attacked. 

Fire blasted him into the nearest wall, surging down his throat, through 
his ears, up his nose. Flame that did not burn, flame that was mere light, 
blindingly white-- 

The overseer roared, thrashing as her magic swept into him, melded 
with him. 

But there was nothing inside to grab on to. No darkness to burn out, no 
remaining ember to breathe life into. Only-- 

Aelin reeled back, magic vanishing and knees buckling as if struck. Her 
head gave a throb, and nausea roiled in her gut. She knew that feeling--that 
taste. 

Iron. As if the man's core was made of it. And that oily, hideous 
aftertaste ... Wyrdstone. 

The demon inside the overseer let out a choked laugh. "What are collars 
and rings compared to a solid heart? A heart of iron and Wyrdstone, to 
replace the coward's heart beating within." 

"Why," she breathed. 

"I was planted here to demonstrate what is waiting should you and your 
court visit Morath." 

Aelin slammed her fire into him, scouring his insides, striking that core 
of pure darkness inside. Again, again, again. The overseer kept roaring, but 
Aelin kept attacking, until-- 

She vomited all over the stones between them. Aedion hauled her 
upright. 


Aelin lifted her head. She'd burned off his clothes, but not touched the 
skin. 

And there--pulsing against his ribs as if it were a fist punching through 
--was his heart. 

It slammed into his skin, stretching bone and flesh. 

Aelin flinched back. Aedion threw a hand in her path as the overseer 
arched in agony, his mouth open in a silent scream. 

Lysandra flapped down from the rafters, shifting into leopard form at 
their side and snarling. 

Again, that fist struck from inside. And then bones snapped, punching 
outward, ripping through muscle and skin as if his chest cavity were the 
petals of a blooming flower. There was nothing inside. No blood, no organs. 

Only a mighty, ageless darkness--and two flickering golden embers at 
its core. 

Not embers. Eyes. Simmering with ancient malice. They narrowed in 
acknowledgment and pleasure. 

It took every ounce of her fire to steel her spine, to tilt her head at a 
jaunty angle and drawl, "At least you know how to make a good entrance, 
Erawan." 


Chapter 15 


The overseer spoke, but the voice was not his. And the voice was not 
Perrington's. 

It was a new voice, an old voice, a voice from a different world and 
lifetime, a voice that fed on screams and blood and pain. Her magic 
thrashed against the sound, and even Aedion swore softly, still trying to 
herd her behind him. 

But Aelin stood fast against the darkness peering at them from the 
man's cracked chest. And she knew that even if his body hadn't been 
irreparably broken, there was nothing left inside him to save anyway. 
Nothing worth saving to begin with. 

She flexed her fingers at her sides, rallying her magic against the 
darkness that coiled and swirled inside the man's shattered chest. 

Erawan said, "I would think gratitude is in order, Heir of Brannon." 

She flicked her brows up, tasting smoke in her mouth. Easy, she 
murmured to her magic. Careful--she'd have to be so careful he did not see 
the amulet around her neck, sense the presence of the final Wyrdkey inside. 
With the first two already in his possession, if Erawan suspected that the 
third key was in this temple, and that his utter dominance over this land and 
all others was close enough to grab ... She had to keep him distracted. 

So Aelin snorted. "Why should I thank you, exactly?" 

The embers of eyes slid upward, as if surveying the hollow body of the 
overseer. "For this small warning present. For ridding the world of one 
more bit of vermin." 

And for making you realize how fruitless standing against me will be, 
that voice whispered right into her skull. 

She slammed fire outward in a blind maneuver, stumbling back into 
Aedion at the caress in that hideous, beautiful voice. From her cousin's pale 
face, she knew he'd heard it, too, felt its violating touch. 


Erawan chuckled. "I'm surprised you tried to save him first. Given what 
he did to you at Endovier. My prince could scarcely stand to be inside his 
mind, it was already so vile. Do you find pleasure in deciding who shall be 
saved and who is beyond it? So easy, to become a little, burning god." 

Nausea, true and cold, struck her. 

But it was Aedion who smirked, "I'd think you'd have better things to 
do, Erawan, than taunt us in the dead hours of the morning. Or is this all 
just a way to make yourself feel better about Dorian Havilliard slipping 
through your nets?" 

The darkness hissed. Aedion squeezed her shoulder in silent warning. 
End it now. Before Erawan might strike. Before he could sense that the 
Wyrdkey he sought was mere feet away. 

So Aelin inclined her head to the force staring at them through flesh and 
bone. "I suggest you rest and gather your strength, Erawan," she purred, 
winking at him with every shred of bravado left in her. "You're going to 
need it." 

A low laugh as flames started to flicker in her eyes, heating her blood 
with welcome, delicious warmth. "Indeed. Especially considering the plans 
I have for the would-be King of Adarlan." 

Aelin's heart stopped. 

"Perhaps you should have told your lover to disguise himself before he 
snatched Dorian Havilliard out of Rifthold." Those eyes narrowed to slits. 
"What was his name ... Oh, yes," Erawan breathed, as if someone had 
whispered it to him. "Prince Rowan Whitethorn of Doranelle. What a prize 
he shall be." 

Aelin plummeted down into fire and darkness, refusing to yield one 
inch to the terror creeping over her. 

Erawan crooned, "My hunters are already tracking them. And I am 
going to hurt them, Aelin Galathynius. I am going to hone them into my 
most loyal generals. Starting with your Fae Prince--" 

A battering ram of hottest blue slammed into that pit in the man's chest 
cavity, into those burning eyes. 

Aelin kept her magic focused on that chest, on the bones and flesh 
melting away, leaving only that heart of iron and Wyrdstone untouched. Her 
magic flowed around it like a stream surging past a rock, burning his body, 
that thing inside him-- 


"Don't bother saving any part of him," Aedion snarled softly. 

Her magic roaring out of her, Aelin glanced over a shoulder. Lysandra 
was now in human form beside Aedion, teeth gritted at the overseer-- 

The look cost her. 

She heard Aedion's shout before she felt Erawan's punch of darkness 
crash into her chest. 

Felt the air snap against her as she was hurled back, felt her body bark 
against the stone wall before the agony of that darkness really sank in. Her 
breath stalled, her blood halted-- 

Get up get up get up. 

Erawan laughed softly as Aedion was instantly at her side, dragging her 
to her feet as her mind, her body tried to reorder itself-- 

Aelin threw out her power again, letting Aedion believe she allowed 
him to hold her upright simply because she forgot to step away, not because 
her knees were shaking so violently she wasn't sure she could stand. 

But her hand remained steady, at least, as she extended it. 

The temple around them shuddered at the force of the power she hurled 
out of herself. Dust and kernels of debris trickled from the ceiling high 
above; columns swayed like drunken friends. 

Aedion's and Lysandra's faces glowed in the blue light of her flame, 
their features wide-eyed but set with solid determination--and wrath. She 
leaned farther into Aedion as her magic roared from her, his grip tightening 
at her waist. 

Each heartbeat was a lifetime; each breath ached. 

But the overseer's body at last ripped apart under her power--the dark 
shields around it yielding to her. 

And some small part of her realized that it only did so when Erawan 
deigned to leave, those amused, ember-like eyes guttering into nothing. 

When the man's body was only ashes, Aelin reeled back her magic, 
cocooned her heart in it. She gripped Aedion's arm, trying not to breathe 
too loudly, lest he hear the rasp of her battered lungs, realize how hard that 
single plume of darkness had hit. 

A heavy thud echoed through the silent temple as the lump of iron and 
Wyrdstone fell. 

That was the cost--Erawan's plan. To realize that the only mercy she 
might offer her court would be death. 


If they were ever captured ... he'd make her watch as they were all 
carved apart and filled with his power. Make her look into their faces when 
he'd finished, and find no trace of their souls within. Then he'd get to work 
on her. 

And Rowan and Dorian ... If Erawan was hunting them at this very 
moment, if he learned that they were in Skull's Bay, and how hard he'd 
actually struck her-- 

Aelin's flames banked to a quiet ember, and she finally found enough 
strength in her legs to push away from Aedion's grip. 

"We need to be on that ship before dawn, Aelin," he said. "If Erawan 
wasn't bluffing..." 

Aelin only nodded. They had to get to Skull's Bay as fast as the winds 
and currents could carry them. 

But as she turned toward the archway out of the temple, heading for the 
archives, she glanced at her chest--utterly untouched, though Erawan's 
power had hit her like a hurled spear. 

He'd missed. By three inches, Erawan had narrowly missed hitting the 
amulet. And possibly sensing the Wyrdkey inside it. 

Yet the blow still reverberated against her bones in brutal ripples. 

A reminder that she might be the heir of fire ... but Erawan was King of 
the Darkness. 


Chapter 16


Manon Blackbeak watched the black skies above Morath bleed to rotted 
gray on the last morning of Asterin's life. 

She had not slept the entirety of the night; had not eaten or drank; had 
done nothing but sharpen Wind-Cleaver in the frigid openness of the 
wyvern's aerie. Over and over, she had honed the blade, leaning against 
Abraxos's warm side, until her fingers were too stiff with cold to grip sword 
or stone. 

Her grandmother had ordered Asterin locked in the deepest bowels of 
the Keep's dungeon, so heavily guarded that escape was impossible. Or 
rescue. 

Manon had toyed with the idea for the first few hours after the sentence 
had been given. But to rescue Asterin would be to betray her Matron, her 
Clan. Her mistake--it was her own mistake, her own damned choices, that 
had led to this. 

And if she stepped out of line again, the rest of the Thirteen would be 
put down. She was lucky she hadn't been stripped of her title as Wing 
Leader. At least she could still lead her people, protect them. Better than 
allowing someone like Iskra to take command. 

The Ferian Gap legion's assault on Rifthold under Iskra's command had 
been sloppy, chaotic--not the systematic, careful sacking Manon would 
have planned had they asked her. It made no difference now whether the 
city was in full or half ruin. It didn't alter Asterin's fate. 

So there was little to be done, other than to sharpen her ancient blade 
and memorize the Words of Request. Manon would have to utter them at 
the right moment. This last gift, she could give her cousin. Her only gift. 

Not the long, slow torture and beheading that was typical of a witch 
execution. 

But the swift mercy of Manon's own blade. 


Boots scuffed on stone and crunched the hay littering the aerie floor. 
Manon knew that step--knew it as well as Asterin's own gait. "What," she 
said to Sorrel without looking behind her. 

"Dawn approaches," her Third said. 

Soon to be Second. Vesta would become Third, and ... and maybe 
Asterin would at last see that hunter of hers, see the stillborn witchling 
they'd had together. 

Never again would Asterin ride the winds; never again would Asterin 
soar on the back of her sky-blue mare. Manon's eyes slid to the wyvern 
across the aerie--shifting on her two legs, awake when the others were not. 

As if she could sense her mistress's doom beckoning with each passing 
moment. 

What would become of the mare when Asterin was gone? 

Manon rose to her feet, Abraxos nudging the backs of her thighs with 
his snout. She reached down, brushing his scaly head. She didn't know who 
it was meant to comfort. Her crimson cape, as bloody and filthy as the rest 
of her, was still clasped at her collarbone. 

The Thirteen would become twelve. 

Manon met Sorrel's gaze. But her Third's attention was on Wind- 
Cleaver, bare in Manon's hand. 

Her Third said, "You mean to make the Words of Request." 

Manon tried to speak. But she could not open her mouth. So she only 
nodded. 

Sorrel stared toward the open archway beyond Abraxos. "I wish she had 
the chance to see the Wastes. Just once." 

Manon forced herself to lift her chin. "We do not wish. We do not 
hope," she said to her soon-to-be Second. Sorrel's eyes snapped to her, 
something like hurt flashing there. Manon took the inner blow. She said, 
"We will move on, adapt." 

Sorrel said quietly, but not weakly, "She goes to her death to keep your 
secrets." 

It was the closest Sorrel had ever come to outright challenge. To 
resentment. 

Manon sheathed Wind-Cleaver at her side and strode for the stairwell, 
unable to meet Abraxos's curious stare. "Then she will have served me well 
as Second, and will be remembered for it." 


Sorrel said nothing. 
So Manon descended into the gloom of Morath to kill her cousin. 


The execution was not to be held in the dungeon. 

Rather, her grandmother had selected a broad veranda overlooking one 
of the endless drops into the ravine curled around Morath. Witches were 
crowded onto the balcony, practically thrumming with bloodlust. 

The Matrons stood before the gathered group, Cresseida and the 
Yellowlegs Matron flanked by each of their heirs, all facing the open doors 
through which Manon and the Thirteen exited the Keep proper. 

Manon did not hear the murmur of the crowd; did not hear the roaring 
wind ripping between the high turrets; did not hear the strike of hammers in 
the forges of the valley below. 

Not when her attention went to Asterin, on her knees before the 
Matrons. She, too, was facing Manon, still in her riding leathers, her golden 
hair limp and knotted, flecked with blood. She lifted her face-- 

"It was only fair," Manon's grandmother drawled, the crowd silencing, 
"for Iskra Yellowlegs to also avenge the four sentinels slaughtered on your 
watch. Three blows apiece for each of the sentinels killed." 

Twelve blows total. But from the cuts and bruises on Asterin's face, the 
split lip, from the way she cradled her body as she bent over her knees ... It 
had been far more than that. 

Slowly, Manon looked at Iskra. Cuts marred her knuckles--still raw 
from the beating she'd given Asterin in the dungeon. 

While Manon had been upstairs, brooding. 

Manon opened her mouth, her rage a living thing thrashing in her gut, 
her blood. But Asterin spoke instead. 

"Be glad to know, Manon," her Second rasped with a faint, cocky smile, 
"that she had to chain me up to beat me." 

Iskra's eyes flashed. "You still screamed, bitch, when I whipped you." 

"Enough," Manon's grandmother cut in, waving a hand. 

Manon barely heard the order. 

They had whipped her sentinel like some underling, like some mortal 
beast-- 


Someone snarled, low and vicious, to her right. 

The breath went out of her as she found Sorrel--unmovable rock, 
unfeeling stone--baring her teeth at Iskra, at those assembled here. 

Manon's grandmother stepped forward, brimming with displeasure. 
Behind Manon, the Thirteen were a silent, unbreakable wall. 

Asterin began scanning their faces, and Manon realized her Second 
understood that it was the last time she'd do so. 

"Blood shall be paid with blood,' Manon's grandmother and the 
Yellowlegs Matron said in unison, reciting from their eldest rituals. Manon 
steeled her spine, waiting for the right moment. "Any witch who wishes to 
extract blood in the name of Zelta Yellowlegs may come forward." 

Iron nails slid out from the hands of the entire Yellowlegs coven. 

Asterin only stared at the Thirteen, her bloody face unmoved, eyes 
clear. 

The Yellowlegs Matron said, "Form the line." 

Manon pounced. 

"I invoke the right of execution." 

Everyone froze. 

Manon's grandmother's face went pale with rage. But the other two 
Matrons, even Yellowlegs, just waited. 

Manon said, head high, "I claim the right to my Second's head. Blood 
shall be paid with blood--but at my sword's edge. She is mine, and so shall 
her death be mine." 

For the first time, Asterin's mouth tightened, eyes gleaming. Yes, she 
understood the only gift Manon could give her, the only honor left. 

It was Cresseida Blueblood who cut in before the other two Matrons 
could speak. "For saving my daughter's life, Wing Leader, it shall be 
granted." 

The Yellowlegs Matron whipped her head to Cresseida, a retort on her 
lips, but it was too late. The words had been spoken, and the rules were to 
be obeyed at any cost. 

The Crochan's red cape fluttering behind her in the wind, Manon dared 
a look at her grandmother. Only hatred glowed in those ancient eyes-- 
hatred, and a flicker of satisfaction that Asterin would be ended after 
decades of being deemed an unfit Second. 

But at least this death was now hers to give. 


And in the east, slipping over the mountains like molten gold, the sun 
began to rise. 

A hundred years she'd had with Asterin. She'd always thought they'd 
have a hundred more. 

Manon said softly to Sorrel, "Turn her around. My Second shall see the 
dawn one last time." 

Sorrel obediently stepped forward, pivoting Asterin to face the High 
Witches, the crowd by the rail--and the rare sunrise piercing through 
Morath's gloom. 

Blood soaked through the back of her Second's leathers. 

And yet Asterin knelt, shoulders square and head high, as she looked 
not at the dawn--but at Manon herself while she stalked around her Second 
to take a place a few feet before the Matrons. 

"Sometime before breakfast, Manon," her grandmother said from a few 
feet behind. 

Manon drew Wind-Cleaver, the blade singing softly as it slid free of its 
sheath. 

The sunlight gilded the balcony as Asterin whispered, so softly that only 
Manon could hear, "Bring my body back to the cabin." 

Something in Manon's chest broke--broke so violently that she 
wondered if it was possible for no one to have heard it. 

Manon lifted her sword. 

All it would take was one word from Asterin, and she could save her 
own hide. Spill Manon's secrets, her betrayals, and she'd walk free. Yet her 
Second uttered no other word. 

And Manon understood in that moment that there were forces greater 
than obedience, and discipline, and brutality. Understood that she had not 
been born soulless; she had not been born without a heart. 

For there were both, begging her not to swing that blade. 

Manon looked to the Thirteen, standing around Asterin in a half circle. 

One by one, they lifted two fingers to their brows. 

A murmur went through the crowd. The gesture not to honor a High 
Witch. 

But a Witch-Queen. 

There had not been a Queen of Witches in five hundred years, either 
among the Crochans or the Ironteeth. Not one. 


Forgiveness shone in the faces of her Thirteen. Forgiveness and 
understanding and loyalty that was not blind obedience, but forged in pain 
and battle, in shared victory and defeat. Forged in hope for a better life--a 
better world. 

At last, Manon found Asterin's gaze, tears now rolling down her 
Second's face. Not from fear or pain, but in farewell. A hundred years--and 
yet Manon wished she'd had more time. 

For a heartbeat, she thought of that sky-blue mare in the aerie, the 
wyvern that would wait and wait for a rider who would never return. 
Thought of a green rocky land spreading to the western sea. 

Hand trembling, Asterin pressed her fingers to her brow and extended 
them. "Bring our people home, Manon," she breathed. 

Manon angled Wind-Cleaver, readying for the strike. 

The Blackbeak Matron snapped, "Be done with it, Manon." 

Manon met Sorrel's eyes, then Asterin's. And Manon gave the Thirteen 
her final order. 

"Run." 

Then Manon Blackbeak whirled and brought Wind-Cleaver down upon 
her grandmother. 


Chapter 17 


Manon saw only the flash of her grandmother's rusted iron teeth, the 
glimmer of her iron nails as she raised them to ward against the sword--but 
too late. 

Manon slashed Wind-Cleaver down, a blow that would have cut most 
men in half. 

Yet her grandmother darted back fast enough that the sword sliced down 
her torso, ripping fabric and skin as it cut between her breasts in a shallow 
line. Blue blood sprayed, but the Matron was moving, blocking Manon's 
next blow with her iron nails--iron so hard that Wind-Cleaver bounced off. 

Manon did not look to see if the Thirteen obeyed. But Asterin was 
roaring; roaring and shouting to stop. The cries grew more distant, then 
echoed, as if she were now inside the hall, being dragged away. 

No sounds of pursuit--as if the onlookers were too stunned. Good. 

Iskra and Petrah had swords out, iron teeth down as they stepped 
between their Matrons and Manon, herding their two High Witches away. 

The Blackbeak Matron's coven lunged forward, only to be halted by a 
hand. "Stay back," her grandmother commanded, panting as Manon circled 
her. Blue blood leaked down her grandmother's front. An inch closer, and 
she'd have been dead. 

Dead. 

Her grandmother bared her rusted teeth. "She's mine." She jerked her 
chin at Manon. "We do this the ancient way." 

Manon's stomach roiled, but she sheathed her sword. 

A flick of her wrists had her nails out, and a snap of her jaw had her 
teeth descending. 

"Let's see how good you are, Wing Leader," her grandmother hissed, 
and attacked. 

Manon had never seen her grandmother fight, never trained with her. 


And some small part of Manon wondered if it was because her 
grandmother did not want others to know how skilled she was. 

Manon could hardly move fast enough to avoid the nails ripping into 
her face, her neck, her gut, yielding step after step after step. 

She only had to do this long enough to buy the Thirteen time to get to 
the skies. 

Her grandmother slashed for her cheek, and Manon blocked the blow 
with an elbow, slamming the joint down hard into her grandmother's 
forearm. The witch barked in pain, and Manon spun out of reach, circling 
again. 

"It is not so easy to strike now is it, Manon Blackbeak?" her 
grandmother panted as they surveyed each other. No one around them dared 
move; the Thirteen had vanished--every last one of them. She almost 
sagged with relief. Now to keep her grandmother occupied long enough to 
avoid her giving the onlookers the order to pursue. "So much easier with a 
blade, the weapon of those cowardly humans," her grandmother seethed. 
"With the teeth, the nails ... You have to mean it." 

They lunged for each other, some fundamental part of her cracking with 
every slash and swipe and block. They darted apart again. 

"As pathetic as your mother," her grandmother spat. "Perhaps you'll die 
like her, too--with my teeth at your throat." 

Her mother, whom she'd killed coming out of, who had died birthing 
her-- 

"For years, I tried to train her weakness out of you." Her grandmother 
spat blue blood onto the stones. "For the good of the Ironteeth, I made you 
into a force of nature, a warrior equal to none. And this is how you repay 
me--" 

Manon didn't let the words unnerve her. She went for the throat, only to 
feint and slash. 

Her grandmother barked in pain--genuine pain--as Manon's claws 
shredded her shoulder. 

Blood showered her hand, flesh clinging to her nails-- 

Manon staggered back, bile burning her throat. 

She saw the blow coming, but still didn't have time to stop it as her 
grandmother's right hand slashed across her belly. 

Leather, cloth, and skin ripped. Manon screamed. 


Blood, hot and blue, rushed out of her before her grandmother had 
darted back. 

Manon shoved a hand against her abdomen, pushing against the 
shredded skin. Blood dribbled through her fingers, splattering onto the 
stones. 

High above, a wyvern roared. 

Abraxos. 

The Blackbeak Matron laughed, flicking Manon's blood off her nails. 
"Pm going to dice your wyvern into tiny pieces and feed him to the 
hounds." 

Despite the agony in her belly, Manon's vision honed. "Not if I kill you 
first." 

Her grandmother chuckled, still circling, assessing. "You are stripped of 
your title as Wing Leader. You are stripped of your title as heir." Step after 
step, closer and closer, an adder looping around its prey. "From this day, 
you are Manon Witch Killer, Manon Kin Slayer." 

The words pelted her like stones. Manon backed toward the balcony 
rail, pushing against the wound in her stomach to keep the blood in. The 
crowd parted like water around them. Just a little longer--just another 
minute or two. 

Her grandmother paused, blinking toward the open doors, as if realizing 
the Thirteen had vanished. Manon attacked again before she could give the 
order to pursue. 

Swipe, lunge, slash, duck--they moved in a whirlwind of iron and 
blood and leather. 

But as Manon twisted away, the wounds in her stomach gave more, and 
she stumbled. 

Her grandmother didn't miss a beat. She struck. 

Not with her nails or teeth, but with her foot. 

The kick to Manon's stomach set her screaming, a roar again answered 
by Abraxos, locked high above. Soon to die, as she would. She prayed the 
Thirteen would spare him, let him join them wherever they would flee. 

Manon slammed into the stone rail of the balcony and crumpled to the 
black tiles. Blue blood leaked from her, staining the thighs of her pants. 

Her grandmother slowly approached, panting. 


Manon grabbed the balcony rail, hauling herself to her feet one last 
time. 

"Do you want to know a secret, Kin Slayer?" her grandmother breathed. 

Manon slumped against the balcony rail, the drop below endless and a 
relief. They'd take her to the dungeons--either use her for Erawan's 
breeding, or torture her until she begged for death. Maybe both. 

Her grandmother spoke so softly that even Manon could barely hear 
over her own gasps for air. "As your mother labored to push you out, she 
confessed who your father was. She said you ... you would be the one who 
broke the curse, who saved us. She said your father was a rare-born 
Crochan Prince. And she said that your mixed blood would be the key." Her 
grandmother lifted her nails to her mouth and licked off Manon's blue 
blood. 

No. 

No. 

"So you have been a Kin Slayer your whole life," her grandmother 
purred. "Hunting down those Crochans--your relatives. When you were a 
witchling, your father searched the lands for you. He never stopped loving 
your mother. Loving her," she spat. "And loving you. So I killed him." 

Manon gazed at the drop below, the death that beckoned. 

"His despair was delicious when I told him what I'd done to her. What I 
would make you into. Not a child of peace--but war." 

Made. 

Made. 

Made. 

Manon's iron nails chipped on the dark stone of the balcony rail. And 
then her grandmother said the words that broke her. 

"Do you know why that Crochan was spying in the Ferian Gap this 
spring? She had been sent to find you. After a hundred and sixteen years of 
searching, they had finally learned the identity of their dead prince's lost 
child." 

Her grandmother's smile was hideous in its absolute triumph. Manon 
willed strength to her arms, to her legs. 

"Her name was Rhiannon, after the last Crochan Queen. And she was 
your half sister. She confessed it to me upon our tables. She thought it'd 


save her life. And when she saw what you had become, she chose to let the 
knowledge die with her." 

"I am a Blackbeak," Manon rasped, blood choking her words. 

Her grandmother took a step, smiling as she crooned, "You are a 
Crochan. The last of their royal bloodline with the death of your sister at 
your own hand. You are a Crochan Queen." 

Absolute silence from the witches gathered. 

Her grandmother reached for her. "And you're going to die like one by 
the time I'm finished with you." 

Manon didn't let her grandmother's nails touch her. 

A boom sounded nearby. 

Manon used the strength she'd gathered in her arms, her legs, to hurl 
herself onto the stone ledge of the balcony. 

And roll off it into the open air. 


Air and rock and wind and blood-- 

Manon slammed into a warm, leathery hide, screaming as pain from her 
wounds blacked out her vision. 

Above, somewhere far away, her grandmother was shrieking orders-- 

Manon dug her nails into the leathery hide, burying her claws deep. 
Beneath her, a bark of discomfort she recognized. Abraxos. 

But she held firm, and he embraced the pain as he banked to the side, 
swerving out of Morath's shadow-- 

She felt them around her. 

Manon managed to open her eyes, flicking the clear lid against the wind 
into place. 

Edda and Briar, her Shadows, were now flanking her. She knew they'd 
been there, waiting in the shadows with their wyverns, had heard every one 
of those damning last words. "The others have flown ahead. We were sent 
to retrieve you," Edda, the eldest of the sisters, shouted over the roar of the 
wind. "Your wound--" 

"It's shallow," Manon snapped, forcing the pain aside to focus on the 
task at hand. She was on Abraxos's neck, the saddle a few feet behind her. 
One by one, every breath an agony, she released her nails from his skin and 


slid toward the saddle. He evened out his flight, offering smooth air to 
buckle herself into the harness. 

Blood leaked from the gouges in her belly--soon the saddle was slick 
with it. 

Behind them, several roars set the mountains trembling. 

"We can't let them get to the others," Manon managed to say. 

Briar, black hair streaming behind her, swept in closer. "Six Yellowlegs 
on our tail. From Iskra's personal coven. Closing in fast." 

With a score to settle, they'd no doubt been given free rein to slaughter 
them. 

Manon surveyed the peaks and ravines of the mountains around them. 

"Two apiece," she ordered. The Shadows' black wyverns were 
enormous--skilled at stealth, but devastating in a fight. "Edda, you drive 
two to the west; Briar, you slam the other two to the east. Leave the last two 
to me." 

No sign of the rest of the Thirteen in the gray clouds or mountains. 

Good--they had gotten away. It was enough. 

"You kill them, then you find the others,' Manon ordered, an arm 
draped over her wound. 

"But, Wing Leader--" 

The title almost sapped her will. But Manon barked, "That's an order." 

The Shadows bowed their heads. Then, as if sharing one mind, one 
heart, they banked to either direction, peeling away from Manon like petals 
in the wind. 

Bloodhounds on a scent, four Yellowlegs split from their group to deal 
with each Shadow. 

The two in the center flew faster, harder, spreading apart to close in on 
Manon. Her vision blurred. 

Not a good sign--not a good sign at all. 

She breathed to Abraxos, "Let's make it a final stand worthy of song." 

He bellowed in answer. 

The Yellowlegs swept near enough for Manon to count their weapons. 
A battle cry shattered from the one to her right. 

Manon dug her left heel into Abraxos's side. 

Like a shooting star, he blasted down toward the peaks of the ashy 
mountains. The Yellowlegs dove with them. 


Manon aimed for a ravine running through the spine of the mountain 
range, her vision flashing black and white and foggy. A chill crept into her 
bones. 

The walls of the ravine closed around them like the maw of a mighty 
beast, and she pulled on the reins once. 

Abraxos flung out his wings and coasted along the side of the ravine 
before catching a current and leveling out, flapping like hell through the 
heart of the crevasse, pillars of stone jutting from the floor like lances. 

The Yellowlegs, too ensnared in their bloodlust, their wyverns too large 
and bulky, balked at the ravine--at the sharp turn-- 

A boom and a screech, and the whole ravine shuddered. 

Manon swallowed her bark of agony to peer behind. One of the wyverns 
had panicked, too big for the space, and slammed into a stone column. 
Broken bone and blood rained down. 

But the other wyvern had managed to bank, and now sailed toward 
them, wings so wide they nearly grazed either side of the ravine. 

Manon panted through her bloody teeth, "Fly, Abraxos." 

And her gentle, warrior-hearted mount flew. 

Manon focused on keeping to the saddle, on keeping the arm pressed 
against her wound to hold the blood in, keep that lethal cold away. She'd 
gotten enough injuries to know her grandmother had struck deep and true. 

The ravine swerved right, and Abraxos took the turn with expert skill. 
She prayed for the boom and roar of the pursuing wyvern to hit the walls, 
but none came. 

But Manon knew these deadly canyons. She'd flown this path countless 
times on the endless, inane patrols these months. The Yellowlegs, 
sequestered in the Ferian Gap, did not. 

"To the very end, Abraxos," she said. His roar was his only 
confirmation. 

One shot. She'd have one shot. Then she could gladly die, knowing the 
Thirteen wouldn't be pursued. Not today, at least. 

Turn after turn, Abraxos hurtled through the ravine, snapping his own 
tail against the rock to send debris flying into the Yellowlegs sentinel. 

The rider dodged the rocks, her wyvern bobbing on the wind. Closer-- 
Manon needed her closer. She tugged on Abraxos's reins, and he checked 
his speed. 


Turn after turn after turn, black rock flashing by, blurring like her own 
fading vision. 

The Yellowlegs was near enough to throw a dagger. 

Manon looked over a shoulder with her failing eyesight in time to see 
her do just that. 

Not one dagger--but two, metal gleaming in the dim canyon light. 

Manon braced herself for the impact of metal in flesh and bone. 

Abraxos took the final turn as the sentinel hurled her daggers at Manon. 
A towering, impenetrable wall of black stone arose, mere feet away. 

But Abraxos soared up, catching the updraft and sailing out of the heart 
of the ravine, so close Manon could touch the dead-end wall. 

The two daggers struck the rock where Manon had been moments 
before. 

And the Yellowlegs sentinel, on her bulky, heavy wyvern, did as well. 

Rock groaned as wyvern and rider splattered against it. And fell to the 
ravine floor. 

Panting, her breath a wet, bloody rasp, Manon patted Abraxos's side. 
Even the motion was feeble. "Good," she managed to say. 

Mountains became small again. Oakwald spread before her. Trees--the 
cover of trees might hide her ... "Oak ... ," she rasped. 

Manon didn't finish the command before the Darkness swept in to claim 
her. 


Chapter 18 


Elide Lochan kept quiet during the two days she and Lorcan trekked 
through the eastern edges of Oakwald, heading for the plains beyond. 

She had not asked him the questions that seemed to matter the most, 
letting him think her a foolish girl, blinded by gratitude that he had saved 
her. 

He'd quickly forgotten that though he'd carried her out, she'd saved 
herself. And he'd accepted her name--her mothers name--without 
question. If Vernon was on her trail ... It had been a fool's mistake, but 
there was no undoing it, not without raising Lorcan's suspicions. 

So she kept her mouth shut, swallowed her questions. Like why he'd 
been hunting her. Or who his mistress was to command such a powerful 
warrior--why he wanted to get into Morath, why he kept touching some 
object beneath his dark jacket. And why he had looked so surprised-- 
though he'd tried to hide it--when she'd mentioned Celaena Sardothien and 
Aelin Galathynius. 

Elide had no doubt the warrior was keeping secrets of his own, and that 
despite his promise to protect her, the moment he got every answer he 
needed, that protection would end. 

But she still slept soundly these last two nights--thanks to the belly full 
of meat courtesy of Lorcan's hunting. He'd scrounged up two rabbits, and 
when she'd devoured all of hers in minutes, he'd given her half of what was 
left of his. She hadn't bothered being polite by refusing. 

It was midmorning by the time the light in the forest turned brighter, the 
air fresher. And then the roaring of mighty waters--the Acanthus. 

Lorcan stalked ahead, and Elide could have sworn even the trees leaned 
away from him as he held up a hand in a silent motion to wait. 

She obeyed, lingering in the gloom of the trees, praying he wouldn't 
make them return to the tangle of Oakwald, that she wouldn't be denied this 


step into the bright, wide-open world... 

Lorcan motioned again--to come forward. All was clear. 

Elide was silent as she stepped, blinking at the flood of sunshine, from 
the last line of trees to stand beside Lorcan on a high, rocky riverbank. 

The river was enormous, shades of rushing gray and brown--the last of 
the ice melt from the mountains. So wide and wild that she knew she could 
not swim it, and that the crossing had to be somewhere else. But past the 
river, as if the water were a boundary between two worlds... 

Hills and meadows of high emerald grasses swayed on the other side of 
the Acanthus, like a hissing sea under a cloudless blue sky, stretching away 
forever to the horizon. 

"I can't remember," she murmured, the words barely audible over the 
roaring song of the river, "the last time I saw..." In Perranth, locked in that 
tower, she'd only had a view of the city, perhaps the lake if the day was 
clear enough. Then she'd been in that prison wagon, then in Morath, where 
it was only mountains and ash and armies. And during the flight with 
Manon and Abraxos, she had been too lost in terror and grief to notice 
anything at all. But now ... She could not remember the last time she'd seen 
sunlight dancing on a meadow, or little brown birds bobbing and swooping 
on the warm breeze over it. 

"The road is about a mile upriver," Lorcan said, his dark eyes unmoved 
by the Acanthus or the rippling grasses beyond. "If you want your plan to 
work, now would be the time to prepare." 

She cut him a glance. "You need the most work." A flick of black 
brows. Elide clarified, "If this ruse is to succeed, you at least need to ... 
pretend to be human." 

Nothing about the man suggested his human heritage held sway. 

"Hide more of your weapons," she went on. "Leave only the sword." 

Even the mighty blade would be a dead giveaway that Lorcan was no 
ordinary traveler. 

She fished an extra strap of leather out of her jacket pocket. "Tie back 
your hair. You'll look less..." She trailed off at the faint amusement tinged 
with warning in his eyes. "Savage," she made herself say, dangling the 
leather strap between them. Lorcan's broad fingers closed around it, a frown 
on his lips as he obeyed. "And unbutton your jacket," she said, rummaging 
through her mental catalog of traits she had noted seemed less threatening, 


less intimidating. Lorcan obeyed that order, too, and soon the dark gray 
shirt beneath his tight-fitting black jacket was showing, revealing the broad, 
muscled chest. It looked more inclined for solid labor than killing fields, at 
least. 

"And you?" he said, brows still high. 

Elide surveyed herself, and set down her pack. First, she removed the 
leather jacket, even though it left her feeling like a layer of skin had peeled 
off, then she rolled up the sleeves of her white shirt. But without the tight 
leather, the full size of her breasts could be seen--marking her as a woman 
and not a slip of a girl that people assumed she was. She then took to her 
hair, ruffling it out of its braid and restyling it into a knot atop her head. A 
married woman's hairstyle, not the free-flowing locks or plait of youth. 

She stuffed her jacket into her pack, standing up straight to face Lorcan. 

His eyes traveled from her feet to her head, and he frowned again. 
"Bigger tits won't prove or hide anything." 

Her cheeks heated. "Perhaps they'll keep men distracted just enough 
that they won't ask questions." 

With that, she started upstream, trying not to think about the men who 
had touched and sneered in that cell. But if it got her safely across the river, 
she'd use her body to her advantage. Men would see what they wanted to: a 
pretty young woman who did not bristle at their attention, who spoke kindly 
and warmly. Someone trustworthy, someone sweet yet unremarkable. 

Lorcan trailed, then caught up to walk beside her like an actual 
companion and not some promise-bound escort for the final half mile 
around the bend of the river. 

Horses and wagons and shouts greeted them before the sight did. 

But there it was: a broad if worn stone bridge, wagons and carts and 
riders lined up in droves on either side. And about two dozen guards in 
Adarlanian colors monitoring either bank, collecting tolls, and-- 

Checking wagons, inspecting every face and person. 

The ilken had known about her limp. 

Elide slowed, keeping close to Lorcan as they neared the two-story, 
derelict barracks on their side of the river. Down the road, flanked by the 
trees, a few equally sorry-looking buildings were a flurry of activity. An inn 
and a tavern. For travelers to wait out the lines with a drink or meal, or 
perhaps rent a room during inclement weather. 


So many people--humans. No one appeared panicked or hurt or sickly. 
And the guards, despite their uniforms, moved like men while they searched 
the wagons passing the barracks that served as tollhouse and sleeping 
quarters. 

She said quietly to Lorcan as they headed for the dirt road and the 
distant back of the line, "I don't know what magic you possess, but if you 
can make my limp less noticeable--" 

Before she could finish, a force like a cool night wind pushed against 
her ankle and calf, then wrapped around it in a solid grip. A brace. 

Her steps evened out, and she had to bite back her urge to gawk at the 
feeling of walking straight and sure. She didn't allow herself to enjoy it, 
savor it, not when it would likely only last until they cleared the bridge. 

Merchants' wagons idled, crammed with goods from those who hadn't 
wanted to risk the Avery river to the north, their drivers tight-faced at the 
wait and impending inspections. Elide scanned the drivers, the merchants, 
the other travelers ... Each one of them made her instincts shout that they'd 
be betrayed the second they asked to ride or offered a coin to keep quiet. 

To trawl the line would catch the eye of the guards, so Elide used every 
step to study it while seemingly heading toward the back. But she reached 
the end of the line empty-handed. 

Lorcan, however, gave a pointed glance behind her--toward the tavern, 
whitewashed to no doubt hide the near-crumbling stones. "Let's get a bite 
before we wait," he said, loud enough for the wagon in front of them to hear 
and dismiss it. 

She nodded. Someone else might be inside, and her stomach was 
grumbling. Except-- 

"I don't have any money," she murmured as they approached the pale 
wooden door. Lie. She had gold and silver from Manon. But she wasn't 
about to flash it in front of Lorcan, promise or no. 

"Tve got plenty," he said tightly, and she delicately cleared her throat. 

He lifted his brows. 

"You'll win us no allies looking like that," she said, and gave him a 
sweet little smile. "Walk in there looking like a warrior and you'll get 
noticed." 

"And what am I to be, then?" 


"Whatever we need you to be when the time comes. But ... don't 
glower." 

He opened the door, and by the time her eyes adjusted to the glow of the 
wrought-iron chandeliers, Lorcan's face had changed. His eyes might never 
be warm, but a bland smile was on his face, his shoulders relaxed--as if he 
were slightly inconvenienced by the wait but eager for a good meal. 

He almost looked human. 

The tavern was packed, the noise so deafening that she could barely 
speak loudly enough to the nearest barmaid to order lunch. They squeezed 
between crammed tables, and Elide noticed that more than a few pairs of 
eyes went to her chest, then her face. And lingered. 

She pushed against the crawling feeling and kept her steps unhurried as 
she aimed for a table tucked against the back wall that a weary-looking 
couple had just vacated. 

A boisterous party of eight was crammed around the table a few feet 
away, a middle-aged woman with a booming laugh instantly singling 
herself out as their leader. The others at the table--a beautiful, raven-haired 
woman; a barrel-chested bearded man whose hands were as large as dinner 
plates; and a few rough-looking people--all kept looking to the older 
woman, gauging her responses and listening carefully to what she had to 
say. 

Elide slid into the worn wooden chair, Lorcan claiming the one across 
from her--his size earning him a look from the bearded man and the 
middle-aged woman at the table. 

Elide weighed that look. 

Assessment. Not for a fight; not for a threat. But in appreciation and 
calculation. 

Elide wondered for a heartbeat if Anneith herself had nudged that other 
couple to move away--to free up this one table for them. For that very 
look. 

Elide laid her hand out on the table, palm up, and gave Lorcan a sleepy 
smile she'd once seen a kitchen maid give a Morath cook. "Husband," she 
said sweetly, wriggling her fingers. 

Lorcan's mouth tightened, but he took her hand--her fingers dwarfed in 
his. 


His calluses scraped against her own. He noticed it at the same moment 
she did, sliding his hand to cup hers so he might inspect her palm. She 
closed her hand, rotating it to grip his again. 

"Brother," Lorcan murmured so no one else could hear. "I am your 
brother." 

"You are my husband," she said with equal quiet. "We have been 
married three months. Follow my lead." 

He glanced around, not having noticed the assessing stare they'd been 
given. Doubt still danced in his eyes, along with a silent question. 

She said simply, "Men will not fear the threat of a brother. I would still 
be unclaimed--still be open for ... invitations. I have seen how little respect 
men have for anything they think they are entitled to. So you are my 
husband," she hissed, "until I say otherwise." 

A shadow flickered in Lorcan's eyes, along with another question. One 
she didn't want to and couldn't answer. His hand tightened on hers, 
demanding she look at him. She refused. 

Their food arrived, mercifully, before Lorcan could ask it. 

Stew--root vegetables and rabbit. She dug in, nearly melting the roof of 
her mouth at the first bite. 

The group behind them began talking again, and she listened as she ate, 
selecting bits and pieces as if they were shells on a shore. 

"Maybe we'll offer them a performance and they'll cut the toll fee in 
half." From the blond, bearded man. 

"Unlikely," the leader said. "Those pricks would charge us to perform. 
Worse, they enjoy our performance and demand we stay awhile. We can't 
afford that wait. Not when other companies are already on the move. We 
don't want to hit all the plains towns after everyone else." 

Elide almost choked on her stew. Anneith must have freed this table, 
then. Her plan had been to find a troupe or carnival to fall into, disguise 
themselves as workers, and this... 

"We pay full price on that toll," the beautiful woman said, "and we 
might get to that first town half starved and barely able to perform at all." 

Elide lifted her eyes to Lorcan's--he gave a nod. 

She took a sip of her stew, steeling herself, thinking of Asterin 
Blackbeak. Charming, confident, fearless. She'd always had her head at a 


jaunty angle, a looseness to her limbs, a hint of a smile on her lips. Elide 
took a breath, letting those memories sink into muscle and flesh and bone. 

Then she pivoted in her chair, an arm draped around the back as she 
leaned toward their table and said with a grin, "Sorry to interrupt your meal, 
but I couldn't help but overhear your conversation." They all turned toward 
her, brows high, the eyes of the leader going right to Elide's face. She saw 
the assessment: young, pretty, unblemished by a hard life. Elide kept her 
own expression pleasant, willed her eyes to brighten. "Are you some sort of 
performing troupe?" She motioned to Lorcan with a tilt of her head. "My 
husband and I have been looking to fall in with one for weeks with no luck 
--everyone's full." 

"So are we," their leader said. 

"Right," Elide replied merrily. "But that toll 1s steep--for anyone. And 
if we were to be in business together, perhaps on a temporary basis..." 
Lorcan's knee brushed hers in warning. She ignored him. "We'd be glad to 
chip in on the fee--make up any difference owed." 

The woman's assessment turned wary. "We are a carnival indeed. But 
we have no need of new members." 

The bearded man and beautiful woman shot glances at the woman, 
reprimand in their eyes. 

Elide shrugged. "All right, then. But in case you change your mind 
before you depart, my husband'"--a gesture to Lorcan, who was giving his 
best attempt at an easy smile--"is an expert sword-thrower. And in our 
previous troupe, he made good coin matching himself against men who 
sought to best him in feats of strength." 

The leader turned her keen eyes on Lorcan--on the height and muscles 
and posture. 

Elide knew she'd guessed right on the vacancy they'd needed filled 
when the woman said to her, "And what did you do for them?" 

"I worked as a fortune-teller--they called me their oracle." A shrug. 
"Mostly just shadows and guesswork." It'd have to be, considering the little 
fact that she couldn't read. 

The woman remained unimpressed. "And what was your troupe's 
name?" 

They likely knew them--knew every troupe that patrolled the plains. 

She scanned her memory for anything helpful, anything-- 





Yellowlegs. The witches in Morath had once mentioned Baba 
Yellowlegs, who had traveled in a carnival to avoid detection, who had died 
in Rifthold this winter with no explanation.... Detail after detail, buried in 
the catacombs of her memory, poured out. 

"We were in the Carnival of Mirrors," Elide said. Recognition-- 
surprise, respect--sparked in the leader's eyes. "Until Baba Yellowlegs, our 
owner, was killed in Rifthold this past winter. We left, and have been 
looking for work since." 

"Where did you come from, then?" the bearded man asked. 

It was Lorcan who replied, "My family lives on the western side of the 
Fangs. We've spent the past few months with them--waited until the snows 
melted, since the pass was so treacherous. Strange things happening," he 
added, "in the mountains these days." 

The company stilled. 

"Indeed," the raven-haired woman said. She looked to their leader. 
"They could help pay the toll, Molly. And since Saul left, that act has been 
empty..." Likely their sword-thrower. 

"Like I said," Elide chimed in with Asterin's pretty smile, "we'll be 
here for a little while, so if you change your minds ... let us know. If not..." 
She saluted with her dented spoon. "Safe travels." 

Something flashed in Molly's eyes, but the woman looked them over 
once more. "Safe travels," she murmured. 

Elide and Lorcan returned to their meal. 

And when the barmaid came to take their money for it, Elide reached 
into her inner pocket and pulled out a silver coin. 

The barmaid's eyes were wide, but it was the sharp eyes of Molly, of the 
others at that table, that Elide noted as the girl slipped away and brought 
back their change. 

Lorcan kept silent as Elide left a generous tip on the table, but they both 
offered pleasant smiles to the troupe as they vacated their table and the 
tavern. 

Elide went right to the back of the line, still keeping that smile on her 
face, her back straight. 

Lorcan sidled up close, not at all noteworthy for the front they were 
putting on. "You have no money, do you?" 

She gave him a sidelong glance. "Looks like I was mistaken." 


A flash of white teeth as he smiled--genuinely this time. "Well, you'd 
better hope you and I have enough, Marion, because Molly's about to make 
you an offer." 

Elide turned at the crunch of dirt beneath black boots and found Molly 
before them, the others lingering--some slipping around the corner of the 
tavern, to no doubt retrieve the wagons. 

Molly's hard face was flushed--as if they'd been arguing. But she just 
clicked her tongue and said, "Temporary stint. If you're shit, you're out, and 
we won't pay back the money for the toll." 

Elide smiled, not entirely faking it. "Marion and Lorcan, at your service, 
madam." 


His wife. Gods above. 

He was over five hundred years old--and this ... this girl, young 
woman, she-devil, whatever she was, had just bluffed and lied her way into 
a job. A sword-thrower indeed. 

Lorcan lingered outside the tavern, Marion at his side. A small troupe-- 
hence the lack of funds--and one that had seen better days, he realized as 
the two yellow-painted wagons clattered and wobbled into view, pulled by 
four nags. 

Marion carefully observed Molly climb into the driver's seat beside the 
raven-haired beauty, who paid Lorcan absolutely no heed. 

Well, having Marion as his gods-damned wife certainly put an end to 
anything more than appreciation of the stunning woman. 

It was an effort not to growl. He hadn't been with a woman in months 
now. And of course--of course--he'd have the time and interest in one ... 
only to be shackled by another one's lies. 

His wife. 

Not that Marion was hard on the eyes, he noted as she obeyed Molly's 
barked order to climb into the back of the second wagon. Some of the other 
party members followed on piss-poor horses. 

Marion took the bearded man's extended hand and he easily hauled her 
into the wagon. Lorcan trailed, assessing everyone in the party, everyone in 


the makeshift little town. A number of men, and some women, had noticed 
Marion when she strode by. 

The sweet face paired with sinful curves--and without the limp, with 
her hair out of her face ... She knew exactly what she was doing. Knew 
people would notice those things, think about those things, instead of the 
cunning mind and lies she fed them. 

Lorcan ignored the hand the bearded man offered and jumped into the 
back of the wagon, reminding himself to sit close to Marion, to put an arm 
around her bony shoulders and look relieved and happy to have a troupe 
again. 

Supplies filled the wagon, along with five other people who all smiled 
at Marion--and then quickly looked away from him. 

Marion put a hand on his knee, and Lorcan avoided the urge to flinch. It 
had been a shock, earlier, to feel how rough those delicate hands were. 

Not just a prisoner in Morath--but a slave. 

The calluses were old and dense enough that she'd likely worked for 
years. Hard labor, from the looks of it--and with that ruined leg... 

He tried not to think about that tang of fear and pain he'd sensed when 
she'd told him how little she believed in the kindness and decency of men. 
He didn't let his imagination delve too deep regarding why she might feel 
that way. 

The wagon was hot, the air soaked with human sweat, hay, the shit of 
the horses lined up before them, the tang of iron from the weapons. 

"Not much by way of belongings?" asked the bearded man--Nik, he'd 
called himself. 

Shit. He'd forgotten humans traveled with baggage as if they were 
moving somewhere-- 

"We lost most of it on our trip out of the mountains. My husband," 
Marion said with charming annoyance, "insisted we ford a rushing stream. 
I'm lucky he even bothered to help me out, since he certainly didn't go after 
our supplies." 

A low chuckle from Nik. "I suspect he was more focused on saving you 
than on the packs." 

Marion rolled her eyes, patting Lorcan's knee. He nearly cringed at 
every touch. 


Even with his lovers, outside the bed itself, he didn't like casual, 
careless contact. Some found that intolerable. Some thought they could 
break him into a decent male who just wanted a home and a good female to 
work beside him. Not one of them had succeeded. 

"I can save myself," Marion said brightly. "But his throwing swords, 
our cooking supplies, my clothes..." A shake of the head. "His act might be 
a bit lackluster until we can find somewhere to purchase more supplies." 

Nik met Lorcan's eyes, holding them for longer than most men dared. 
What he did for the carnival, Lorcan wasn't sure. Sometime performer--but 
definitely security. Nik's smile faded a bit. "The land beyond the Fangs isn't 
kind. Your people must be hardy folk to live out there." 

Lorcan nodded. "A rougher life," he said, "than I want for my wife." 

"Life on the road isn't much better," Nik countered. 

"Ah," Marion chimed in, "but isn't it? A life of open skies and roads, of 
wandering where the wind takes you, answering to no one and nothing? A 
life of freedom..." She shook her head. "What more could I ask than to live 
a life unchecked by cages?" 

Lorcan knew the words were no lie. He had seen her face when they 
beheld the grassy plain. 

"Spoken like someone who has spent long enough on the road," Nik 
said. "It always goes either way with our kind: you settle down and never 
travel again, or you wander forever." 

"I want to see life--see the world," Marion said, her voice softening. "I 
want to see everything." 

Lorcan wondered if Marion would even get to do that if he failed in his 
task, if the Wyrdkey he carried wound up in the wrong hands. 

"Best not wander too far," Nik said, frowning. "Not with what happened 
in Rifthold--or what's brewing down in Morath." 

"What happened in Rifthold?" Lorcan cut in, sharply enough that 
Marion squeezed his knee. 

Nik idly scratched his wheat-colored beard. "Whole city's been sacked 
--overrun, they say, by flying terrors and demon-women as their riders. 
Witches, if one is to believe the rumors. Ironteeth, straight out of legend." A 
shudder. 

Holy gods. The destruction would have been a sight to behold. Lorcan 
forced himself to listen, to concentrate and not begin calculating casualties 





and what it would mean for this war, as Nik continued, "No word on the 
young king. But the city belongs to the witches and their beasts. They say to 
travel north is to now face a death trap; to travel south is another death trap 
... 30' --a shrug--'we'll head east. Maybe we can find a way to bypass 
whatever's waiting in either direction. Maybe war will come and we'll all 
scatter to the winds." Nik looked him over. "Men like you and me might be 
conscripted." 

Lorcan bit back a dark chuckle. No one could force him into anything-- 
save for one person, and she ... His chest tightened. It was best not to think 
of his queen. 

"You think either side would do that? Force men to fight?" Marion's 
words were breathless. 

"Don't know," Nik said, the scent and sound of the river now 
overwhelming enough that Lorcan knew they were near the toll. He reached 
into his jacket for the money Molly had demanded. Far more than their fair 
share, but he didn't care. These people could go to hell the moment they 
were safely hidden deep in the endless plains. "Duke Perrington's forces 
might not even want us, if they've got witches and beasts on their side." 

And much worse, Lorcan wanted to say. Wyrdhounds and ilken and the 
gods knew what. 

"But Aelin Galathynius," Nik mused. Marion's hand went limp on 
Lorcan's knee. "Who knows what she will do. She has not called for aid, 
has not asked soldiers to come to her. Yet she held Rifthold in her grip-- 
killed the king, destroyed his castle. But gave the city back." 

The bench beneath them groaned as Marion leaned forward. "What do 
you know of Aelin?" 

"Rumors, here and there," Nik said, shrugging. "They say she's 
beautiful as sin--and colder than ice. They say she's a tyrant, a coward, a 
whore. They say she's gods-blessed--or gods-damned. Who knows? 
Nineteen seems awfully young to have such burdens ... Rumor claims her 
court is strong, though. A shape-shifter guards her back--and two warrior- 
princes flank her on either side." 

Lorcan thought of that shape-shifter, who had so unceremoniously 
vomited not once, but twice, all over him; thought of those two warrior- 
princes ... One of them Gavriel's son. 





"Will she save or damn us all?" Nik considered, now monitoring the 
snaking line behind their wagon. "I don't know if I much like the thought of 
everything resting in her hands, but ... if she wins, perhaps the land will get 
better--life will get better. And if she fails ... perhaps we all deserve to be 
damned anyway." 

"She will win," Marion said with quiet strength. Nik's brows rose. 

Men shouted, and Lorcan said, "I'd save talk of her for another time." 

Boots crunched, and then uniformed men were peering into the back of 
the wagon. "Out," one ordered. "Line up." The man's eyes snagged on 
Marion. 

Lorcan's arm tightened around her as an ugly, too-familiar light filled 
the soldier's eyes. 

Lorcan bit back his snarl as he said to her, "Come, wife." 

The soldier noticed him, then. The man backed away a step, a bit pale, 
then ordered the supplies be searched. 

Lorcan jumped out first, bracing his hands on Marion's waist as he 
helped her off the wagon. When she made to step away, he tugged her back 
against him, an arm across her abdomen. He met each soldier's stare as they 
passed and wondered who was looking after the dark-haired beauty in the 
front. 

A moment later, she and Molly came around. A dark, rimmed hat was 
slung over the beauty's head, half of her light brown face obscured, her 
body concealed in a heavy coat that drew the eye away from any feminine 
curves. Even the cast of her mouth was unpleasant--as if the woman had 
slipped into another person's skin entirely. 

Still, Molly nudged the woman between Lorcan and Nik. Then took the 
money pouch from Lorcan's free hand without so much as a thank-you. 

The dark-haired beauty leaned forward to murmur to Marion, "Don't 
look them in the eye, and don't talk back." 

Marion nodded, chin dipping as she focused on the ground. Against 
him, he could feel her racing heart--wild, despite the calm submission 
written over every line of her body. 

"And you," the beauty hissed at him as the soldiers searched their wares 
--and took what they wanted. "Molly says if you get into a fight, you're 
gone, and we're not bailing you out of prison. So let them talk and laugh, 
but don't interfere." 


Lorcan debated saying he could slaughter this entire garrison if he 
pleased, but nodded. 

After five minutes, another order was shouted. Molly handed over 
Lorcan's money and her own to pay the toll, plus more for "expedited 
passage." Then they were all back in the wagon again, none of them daring 
to see what had been pilfered. Marion was shaking slightly against where he 
kept her tucked into his side, but her face was blank, bored. 

The guards hadn't so much as questioned them--hadn't asked after a 
woman with a limp. 

The Acanthus roared beneath them as they crossed the bridge, wagon 
wheels clattering on ancient stones. Marion kept shaking. 

Lorcan studied her face again--the hint of red along her high 
cheekbones, her tight mouth. 

Not shaking from fear, he realized as he caught a whiff of her scent. A 
slight tang of it, perhaps, but mostly something red-hot, something wild and 
raging and-- 

Anger. It was boiling rage that made her shake. At the inspection, at the 
leering of the guards. 

An idealist--that's what Marion was. Someone who wanted to fight for 
her queen, who believed, as Nik did, that this world could be better. 

As they cleared the other side of the bridge, the soldiers letting them 
pass without fuss, as they meandered past the line on that side, and emerged 
onto the plains themselves, Lorcan wondered at that anger--at that belief in 
a better world. 

He didn't feel like telling either Marion or Nik that their dream was a 
fool's one. 

Marion relaxed enough to peer out the back of the wagon--at the 
grasses flanking the wide dirt road, at the blue sky, at the roaring river and 
the looming sprawl of Oakwald behind them. And for all her rage, a 
tentative sort of wonder grew in her dark eyes. He ignored it. 

Lorcan had seen the worst and best in men for five hundred years. 

There was no such thing as a better world--no such thing as a happy 
end. 

Because there were no endings. 

And there would be nothing waiting for them in this war, nothing 
waiting for an escaped slave girl, but a shallow grave. 


Chapter 19


Rowan Whitethorn just needed a place to rest. He didn't give a shit if it was 
a bed or a pile of hay or even beneath a horse in a stable. As long as it was 
quiet and there was a roof to keep out the driving veils of rain, he didn't 
care. 

Skull's Bay was what he expected, and yet not. Ramshackle buildings, 
painted every color but mostly in cracking disrepair, were bustling as 
residents shuttered windows and hauled in clotheslines against the storm 
that had chased Rowan and Dorian into the harbor minutes ago. 

Hooded and cloaked, no one had asked them any questions once Rowan 
had flipped a five-copper mark to the dockmaster. Enough to keep his 
mouth shut, but not enough to warrant any of the would-be thieves 
monitoring the docks to come after them. 

Dorian had mentioned twice now that he wasn't sure how Rowan was 
still functioning. To be honest, Rowan wasn't, either. He'd allowed himself 
to doze only for hours at a time over the past few days. The burnout loomed 
--steadily fraying his grip on his magic, his focus. 

When Rowan hadn't been wrangling the winds to propel their skiff 
through the vibrant warm waters of the Dead Islands' archipelago, he'd 
been soaring high above to monitor for approaching enemies. He'd seen 
none. Just turquoise ocean and white sands flecked with dark, volcanic 
stone. All of it ringing the dense emerald foliage crusting mountainous 
islands that spread as far as even a hawk's eye could see. 

Thunder grumbled across Skull's Bay, and the turquoise sea beyond the 
harbor seemed to glow brighter, as if a distant lightning strike had lit up the 
entire ocean. Along the docks, a cobalt-painted tavern remained lightly 
guarded, even with the storm bearing down on them. 

The Sea Dragon. Rolfe's own headquarters, named after his ship, from 
Aelin's reports. Rowan debated going right up to it, no more than two lost 


travelers seeking shelter from the storm. 

But he and the young king had chosen another route, during the many 
hours he'd made good on his promise to teach Dorian about magic. They'd 
worked for only minutes at a time--since it'd be no use if the king wrecked 
their little boat should his power slip its leash. So it had been exercises with 
ice: summoning a ball of frost to his palm, letting it melt. Over and over. 

Even now, standing like a stone amid the stream of people hauling in 
wares from the storm's fury, the king was curling and relaxing his fingers, 
letting Rowan glean their bearings while he gazed across the horseshoe- 
shaped bay to the colossal chain stretched across its mouth--currently 
beneath the surface. 

Ship-Breaker, the chain was called. Crusted with barnacles and draped 
in scarves of seaweed, it was connected to a watchtower on either side of 
the bay, where guards would raise and lower the chain to let ships out. Or 
keep ships in until they'd paid the hefty tolls. They'd been lucky that the 
chain had already been lowered in anticipation of the storm. 

Since their plan for announcing themselves would be ... calm. 
Diplomatic. 

Which it would need to be, given that the last time Aelin had set foot in 
Skull's Bay, two years ago, she'd wrecked that chain. And taken out one of 
the now-rebuilt watchtowers (Rolfe, it seemed, had added a sister-tower 
across the bay since then), plus half the town. And disabled the rudders on 
every ship in the harbor, including Rolfe's prized one, the Sea Dragon. 

Rowan wasn't surprised, but seeing the scope of the hell she had 
unleashed ... Holy gods. 

So Dorian's announcement of his arrival would be the opposite of that. 
They'd take rooms at a reputable inn and then request an audience with 
Rolfe. Proper and dignified. 

Lightning flashed, and Rowan swiftly scanned the street ahead, a hand 
gripping his hood to keep the wind from revealing his Fae heritage. 

An emerald-painted inn lay at the other end of the block, its gilded sign 
clacking in the wild wind. THE OCEAN ROSE. 

The nicest inn in town, the dockmaster had claimed when they asked. 
Since they at least needed to appear like they could make good on the 
money they'd offer Rolfe. 


And get some rest, if only for a few hours. Rowan stepped toward it, 
nearly sagging with relief, and looked over a shoulder to motion the king to 
follow. 

But as if the gods themselves wanted to test him, a gust of rain-cooled 
wind sprayed into their faces, and some sense pricked in its wake. A shift in 
the air. Like a great pocket of power gathered close, beckoning. 

The knife at his side was instantly in his soaked hand as he searched the 
rooftops, revealing only plumes of rain. Rowan quieted his mind, listening 
to the city and storm around them. 

Dorian swept his dripping hair out of his face, mouth open to speak-- 
until he noted the knife. "You feel it, too." 

Rowan nodded, rain sliding down his nose. "What do you sense?" 

The king's raw power might pick up different feelings, different clues, 
than what his wind and ice and instinct could detect. But without the 
training, it might not be clear. 

"It feels ... old." Dorian winced, and said over the storm, "Feral. 
Ruthless. I can't glean anything more." 

"Does it remind you of the Valg?" 

If there was one person who'd know, it'd be the king before him. 

"No," Dorian said, gaze shuttering. "They were abhorrent to my magic. 
This thing out there ... It just makes my magic curious. Wary, but curious. 
But it's concealed--somehow." 

Rowan sheathed his knife. "Then stay close and keep alert." 


Dorian had never been in such a place as Skull's Bay. 

Even with the heavy rain lashing them as they hunted the source of that 
power down the main street, he'd marveled at the blend of lawlessness and 
complete order of the island-city. It bowed to no king of royal blood--yet 
was ruled by a Pirate Lord who had clawed his way to power thanks to 
hands tattooed with a map of the world's oceans. 

A map, rumor claimed, that had revealed where enemies, treasure, and 
storms awaited him. The cost: his eternal soul. 

Aelin had once confirmed that Rolfe was indeed soulless and indeed 
tattooed. As for the map ... She'd shrugged, saying Rolfe claimed it 


stopped moving when magic fell. Dorian wondered if that map now 
indicated that he and Rowan walked through his city--if it marked them as 
enemies. 

Perhaps Aelin's arrival would be known well before she set foot on this 
island. 

Cloaked and hooded and thoroughly soaked, Dorian and Rowan made a 
wide circuit of the surrounding streets. People had quickly vanished, and 
the ships in the harbor rocked wildly with the waves lapping over the broad 
quay and onto the cobblestones. Palms thrashed and hissed, and not even 
gulls stirred. 

His magic remained dormant, rumbling when he'd stiffen at a loud 
noise from within the taverns, inns, homes, and shops they passed. At his 
side, Rowan plowed through the storm, the rain and wind seeming to part 
for him. 

They reached the quay, Rolfe's massive prize ship looming out in the 
heaving waters, sails tied down against the storm. 

At least Rolfe was here. At least that had gone right. 

Dorian was so busy observing the ship that he nearly slammed into 
Rowan's back as the warrior-prince halted. 

He staggered back, Rowan mercifully not commenting on it, then 
scanned the building that had snagged the prince's attention. 

His magic perked up like a startled deer. 

"I shouldn't even be surprised," Rowan grumbled, and the blue-painted 
sign clattered in the winds above the tavern entrance. THE SEA DRAGON. 

Two guards stood halfway down the block--guards not for any uniform, 
but for the fact that they were standing in this storm, hands on their swords. 

Rowan angled his head in a way that told Dorian the prince was likely 
contemplating whether it was worth it to chuck the men into the roiling 
harbor. But no one stopped them as Rowan gave Dorian a warning look and 
opened the door to the Pirate Lord's personal tavern. Golden light, spices, 
polished wood floors and walls greeted them. 

It was empty, despite the storm. Utterly empty, save for the dozen or so 
tables. 

Rowan shut the door behind Dorian, scanning the room, the small stairs 
in the back. From where they stood, Dorian could see the letters covering 
most of the tables. 


Storm-Chaser. Lady Ann. Tiger-Star. 

The sterns of ships. Every table was made from them. 

They hadn't been taken from wrecks. No, this was a trophy room--a 
reminder to those who met with the Pirate Lord of how, exactly, he had 
gained his crown. 

All the tables seemed centered around one in the back, bigger and more 
worn than the others. Thresher. The enormous slats were flecked with burn 
marks and gouges--but the lettering remained clear. As if Rolfe never 
wanted to forget what ship was used as his personal dining table. 

But as for the man himself and that power they'd felt ... No sign of 
either. 

A door behind the bar opened, and a slim, brown-haired young woman 
stepped out. Her apron marked her as the barmaid, but her shoulders were 
back, head high--gray eyes sharp and clear as she scanned them and 
remained unimpressed. "He was wondering when you two would come 
snooping," she said, her accent rich and thick--like Aedion's. 

Rowan said, "Oh?" 

The barmaid jerked her delicate chin toward the narrow wood stairs in 
the back. "Captain wants to see you--in his office. One flight up, second 
door down." 

"Why." 

Even Dorian knew not to ignore that tone. But the girl just grabbed a 
glass, held it to the candlelight to inspect for smudges, and pulled a rag 
from her apron. Twin tattoos of roaring gray sea dragons snaked around her 
tan forearms, the beasts seeming to slither as her muscles shifted with the 
movement. 

Their scales, he realized, matched her eyes perfectly as she flicked her 
stare over Dorian and Rowan once more and said coolly, "Don't keep him 
waiting." 


Dorian murmured to Rowan as they ascended the creaky, dim stairs, "It 
could be a trap." 

"Possibly," Rowan said with equal quiet. "But consider that we were 
allowed to come to him. If it was a trap, the smarter move would have been 


to catch us unawares." 

Dorian nodded, something in his chest easing. "And you--your magic 
is ... better?" 

That hard face yielded nothing. "I'Il manage." Not an answer. 

Along the second-level hallway, four steely-eyed young men had been 
stationed, each armed with fine swords whose hilts were fashioned after 
attacking sea dragons--surely the mark of their captain. None bothered to 
speak as he and Rowan made for the indicated door. 

The Fae Prince knocked once. A grunt was all they got in response. 

Dorian didn't know what he expected from the Lord of Pirates. 

But a dark-haired man, a day past thirty if that, lounging on a red velvet 
chaise before the rain-splattered curve of windows was not it. 

Chapter 20


The Pirate Lord of Skull's Bay did not turn from where he was sprawled on 
the chaise, piles of papers littering the worn cobalt rug beneath it. From the 
neat columns that Dorian could barely make out from where he and Rowan 
stood a few feet into the man's office, the papers seemed crammed with 
tallies of goods or expenses--ill-gained or otherwise. 

But Rolfe continued monitoring the ships tilting and bobbing in the 
harbor, the shadow of Ship-Breaker's sagging chain cleaving the storm- 
tossed world beyond them. 

Rolfe had likely learned of their arrival not due to any magic map, but 
from sitting here. Indeed, dark leather gloves adorned his hands--the 
material scarred and cracked with age. Not a hint of the legendary tattoos 
lurking beneath. 

Rowan didn't move; barely blinked as he took in the captain, the office. 
Dorian himself had been part of enough political maneuverings to know the 
uses of silence--the power in who spoke first. The power in making 
someone wait. 

The rain drumming on the windows and the muffled dripping of their 
own soaked clothes on the threadbare carpet filled the quiet. 

Captain Rolfe tapped a gloved finger on the arm of the chaise, watching 
the harbor for a heartbeat longer--as if to make sure the Sea Dragon still 
floated--and finally turned to them. 

"Take off your hoods. I want to know who I'm talking to." 

Dorian stiffened at the command, but Rowan said, "Your barmaid 
implied that you know damn well who we are." 

A wry half smile tugged on Rolfe's lips, the upper-left corner flecked 
with a small scar. Hopefully not from Aelin. "My barmaid talks too much." 

"Then why keep her?" 


"Easy on the eyes--hard to come by around here," Rolfe said, uncoiling 
to his feet. He was about Dorian's height and clothed in simple but well- 
made black. An elegant rapier hung at his side, along with a matching 
parrying knife. 

Rowan snorted, but to Dorian's surprise, removed his hood. 

Rolfe's sea-green eyes flared--no doubt at the silver hair, pointed ears, 
and slightly elongated canines. Or the tattoo. "A man who likes ink as much 
as I do," Rolfe said with an appreciative nod. "I think you and I will get 
along just fine, Prince." 

"Male," Rowan corrected. "Fae males are not human men." 

"Semantics," Rolfe said, flicking his attention to Dorian. "So you're the 
king everyone's in such a tizzy over." 

Dorian finally tugged back his hood. "What of it?" 

With that gloved hand, Rolfe pointed toward a paper-covered desk and 
two upholstered chairs before it. Like the man himself, it was elegant, but 
worn--either from age, use, or battles past. And those gloves ... To cover 
the maps inked there? 

Rowan gave Dorian a nod to sit. The flames on the candles burning 
throughout guttered as they passed, and claimed their seats. 

Rolfe edged around the stacks of papers on the floor and took up his 
spot at the desk. His carved, high-backed chair might very well have been a 
throne from some distant kingdom. "You seem remarkably calm for a king 
who's just been declared a traitor to his crown and robbed of his throne." 

Dorian was glad he was in the process of sitting down. 

Rowan lifted a brow. "According to whom?" 

"According to the messengers who arrived yesterday," Rolfe said, 
leaning back in his seat and crossing his arms. "Duke Perrington--or 
should I call him King Perrington now?--issued a decree, signed by the 
majority of Adarlan's lords and ladies, naming you, Majesty, an enemy to 
your kingdom, and claiming that he liberated Rifthold from your claws after 
you and the Queen of Terrasen slaughtered so many innocents this spring. It 
also claims that any ally'--a nod toward Rowan--"'is an enemy. And that 
you will be crushed under his armies if you do not yield." 

Silence filled his head. Rolfe went on, perhaps a bit more gently, "Your 
brother has been named Perrington's heir and Crown Prince." 


Oh gods. Hollin was a child, but still ... something had rotted in him, 
festered-- 

He had left them there. Rather than deal with his mother and brother, 
he'd told them to stay in those mountains. Where they were now as good as 
lambs surrounded by a pack of wolves. 

He wished Chaol were with him. Wished for time to just ... stop so he 
might sort out all these fractured pieces of himself, put them into some kind 
of order, if not back together entirely. 

Rolfe said, "From the look on your face, I'm guessing your arrival 
indeed has something to do with the fact that Rifthold now lies in ruin, its 
people fleeing wherever they can." 

Dorian shoved out the insidious thoughts and drawled, "I came to learn 
what side of the line you stand on, Captain, in regard to this conflict." 

Rolfe sat forward, resting his forearms on the desk. "You must be 
desperate indeed, then." A glance at Rowan. "And is your queen equally 
desperate for my aid?" 

"My queen," Rowan said, "is not a part of this discussion." 

Rolfe only grinned at Dorian. "You wish to know what side of the line I 
stand on? I stand on the side that keeps the hell out of my territory." 

"Rumor has it," Rowan countered smoothly, "that the easternmost part 
of this archipelago is no longer your territory at all." 

Rolfe held Rowan's gaze. A heartbeat passed. Then another. A muscle 
flickered in Rolfe's jaw. 

Then he pulled off those gloves to reveal hands tattooed from fingertip 
to wrist. He turned them palm up, revealing a map of the archipelago, and 
what-- 

Dorian and Rowan leaned forward as the blue waters did indeed flow, 
little dots among it sailing by. And in the easternmost tip of the archipelago, 
curving out to sea... 

Those waters were gray, the islands a ruddy brown. But nothing moved 
--no dots indicated ships. As if the map had frozen. 

"They have magic that shields them--even from this," Rolfe said. "I 
can't get a count of their ships, or men, or beasts. Scouts never return. This 
winter, we'd hear roaring from the islands--some almost-human, some 
definitely not. Often, we'd spy ... things standing out on those rocks. Men, 
but not. We let it go unchecked for too long--and paid the price." 


"Beasts," Dorian said. "What sort of beasts?" 

A grim smile, scar stretching. "Ones to make you consider fleeing this 
continent, Majesty." 

The condescension snapped something loose in Dorian's temper. "I 
have walked through more nightmares than you realize, Captain." 

Rolfe snorted, but his eyes went to that pale line across Dorian's throat. 

Rowan leaned back in his chair with lazy grace--the War 
Commander incarnate. "It must be a solid truce you hold, then, if you're 
still camped here with minimal ships in your harbor." 

Rolfe simply tugged on his worn gloves. "My fleet does have to do a 
little pirating every now and then, you know. Bills to pay and all that." 

"Pm sure. Especially when you employ four guards to watch your 
hallway." 

Dorian caught Rowan's train of thought and said to the Fae Prince, "I 
didn't scent the Valg in town." No, whatever that power had been ... it had 
flickered into nothing now. 

"That's because," Rolfe drawled, cutting them off, "we killed most of 
them." 

Wind rattled the windows, smearing the rain across them. 

"And as for the four men in the hall--they are all that's left of my crew. 
Thanks to the battle we had early this spring to reclaim this island after 
Perrington's general stole it from us." 

Dorian swore low and viciously. The captain nodded. 

"But I am again Pirate Lord of Skull's Bay, and if the eastern islands are 
as far as Morath plans to go, then Perrington and his beasts can have them. 
The Dead End is barely more than caves and rock anyway." 

"What manner of beasts," Dorian said again. 

Rolfe's pale green eyes darkened. "Sea-wyverns. Witches rule the skies 
with their wyverns--but these waters are now ruled by beasts bred for naval 
battle, foul corruptions of an ancient template. Imagine a creature half the 
size of a first-rate ship--faster than a racing dolphin--and the damage it 
can cause with tooth and claw and a poisoned tail big as a mast. Worse, if 
you kill one of their vicious offspring, the adults will hunt you to the ends 
of the earth." Rolfe shrugged. "So you will find, Majesty, that I have no 
interest in disturbing the eastern islands if they do not disturb me any 


further. I have no interest in doing anything but continuing to profit from 
my endeavors." He waved a vague hand to the papers scattered throughout. 

Dorian held his tongue. The offer he'd been planning to make ... His 
coffers belonged to Morath now. He doubted privateers would volunteer 
based on credit. 

Rowan gave him a look that said the same. Another route to win Rolfe 
to their cause, then. Dorian surveyed the office, the taste leaning toward 
finery and yet so little that was not worn. The half-wrecked town around 
them. The four surviving crew. The way Rolfe had looked at that band of 
white along his throat. 

Rowan opened his mouth, but Dorian said, "They weren't just killed, 
your crew. Some were taken, weren't they?" 

Rolfe's sea-green eyes went cold. 

Dorian pushed, "Captured, along with others, and taken into the Dead 
Islands. Used for information about how and where to strike you. The only 
way to free them when they were sent back to you, demons wearing their 
bodies, was to behead them. Burn them." 

Rowan asked roughly, "Was it rings or collars they wore, Captain?" 

Rolfe's throat bobbed once. After a long moment, he said, "Rings. They 
said they'd been set free. But they weren't the men who..." A shake of the 
head. "Demons," he breathed, as if it explained something. "That's what he 
put in them." 

So Rowan told him. Of the Valg, their princes, and of Erawan, the last 
Valg king. 

Even Rolfe had the wits to look unnerved as Rowan concluded, "He has 
cast off the disguise as Perrington. He is only Erawan now--King Erawan, 
apparently." 

Rolfe's eyes again drifted to Dorian's neck, and it was an effort not to 
touch the scar there. "How did you survive it? We even cut the rings off-- 
but my men ... they were gone." 

Dorian shook his head. "I don't know." No answer didn't make Rolfe's 
men sound ... lesser for not having survived. Maybe he'd been infested by 
a Valg prince who'd savored taking his time. 

Rolfe shifted a piece of paper on his desk, reading it again for a 
heartbeat--as if it were a mere distraction while he thought. He said at last, 


"Wiping what's left of them from the Dead Islands won't do shit against the 
might of Morath." 

"No," Rowan countered, "but if we hold the archipelago, we can use 
these islands to wage a battle from the seas while we strike from the land. 
We can use these islands to house fleets from other kingdoms, other 
continents." 

Dorian added, "My Hand is currently in the southern continent--in 
Antica itself. He will persuade them to send a fleet." Chaol would do 
nothing less for him, for Adarlan. 

"None will come," Rolfe said. "They didn't come ten years ago; they 
certainly won't come now." He surveyed Rowan and added with a small 
smirk, "Especially not with the latest news." 

This couldn't end well, Dorian decided as Rowan asked flatly, "What 
news?" 

Rolfe didn't answer, instead watching the stormy bay, or whatever out 
there held his interest. A rough few months for the man, Dorian realized. 
Someone holding on to this place through sheer arrogance and will. And all 
those tables below, assembled from the wreckage of conquered ships ... 
How many enemies were circling, waiting for a shot at revenge? 

Rowan opened his mouth, no doubt to demand an answer, when Rolfe 
thumped his booted foot thrice on the worn floorboards. An answering 
thump on the wall sounded. 

Silence fell. Given Rolfe's hatred for the Valg, Dorian doubted Morath 
was about to spring shut a trap, but ... he slid deep into his magic as 
footsteps thudded down the hall. From the tight cast of Rowan's tattooed 
face, he knew the prince was doing the same. Especially as Dorian felt his 
magic reach toward the Fae Prince's, as it had done that day with Aelin atop 
the glass castle. 

Those footsteps paused outside the office door, and again, that pulse of 
foreign, mighty magic rose up. Rowan's hand slid into casual distance of 
the hunting knife at his thigh. 

Dorian focused on his breathing, on hauling up lines and pieces of his 
magic. Ice bit into his palms as the office door opened. 

Two golden-haired males appeared in the doorway. 

Rowan's snarl reverberated through the floorboards and along Dorian's 
feet as he took in the muscle, the pointed ears, the gaping mouths that 


revealed elongated canines... 

The two strangers, the source of that power ... They were Fae. 

The one with night-dark eyes and an edged grin looked Rowan over and 
drawled, "I liked your hair longer." 

A dagger embedding itself in the wall not an inch from the male's ear 
was Rowan's only answer. 


Chapter 21


Dorian didn't see the Fae Prince throw the dagger until the blade thudded 
into the wooden wall, its hilt still bobbing with the impact. 

But the dark-eyed, bronze-skinned male--so handsome that Dorian 
blinked--smirked at the dagger shivering beside his head. "Was your aim 
that shitty when you cut your own hair?" 

The other male beside him--tan, tawny-eyed, with a steady sort of quiet 
to him--lifted his broad, tattooed hands. "Rowan, put your blades down. 
We're not here for you." 

For there were already more weapons gripped in Rowan's hands. Dorian 
hadn't even heard him stand, let alone draw the sword, or the elegant 
hatchet in the other hand. 

Dorian's magic writhed in his veins as it studied the two strangers. Here 
you are, it sang. 

Alone with Rowan, his magic had become accustomed to the prince's 
staggering abyss of power, but the three of these males together, ancient and 
powerful and primal ... They were their own maelstrom. They could wreck 
this city without even trying. He wondered if Rolfe realized it. 

The Pirate Lord said drily, "I take it you know each other." 

The solemn, golden-eyed one nodded, his pale clothes so like the ones 
Rowan favored: layered, efficient fabric, fit for battlefields. A band of black 
tattoos encircled the male's muscled neck. Dorian's stomach lurched. From 
a distance, it might very well have been another sort of black collar. 

Rowan said tightly, "Gavriel and Fenrys used to ... work with me." 

Rolfe's sea-green eyes darted among them all, assessing, weighing. 

Fenrys--Gavriel. Dorian knew those names. Rowan had mentioned 
them during their journey here ... Two members of Rowan's cadre. 

Rowan explained to Dorian, "They are blood-sworn to Maeve. As I 
used to be." 


Meaning they were here under her orders. And if Maeve had sent not 
one, but two of her lieutenants to this continent, when Lorcan was already 
here... 

Rowan said through his teeth but sheathed his weapons, "What is your 
business with Rolfe?" 

Dorian released his magic into himself. It settled into his core like a bit 
of dropped ribbon. 

Rolfe waved a hand to the two males. "They're the bearer of the news I 
promised you--among other things." 

"And we were just sitting down to lunch," Fenrys said, those dark eyes 
dancing. "Shall we?" 

Fenrys didn't wait for them as he ducked back into the hall and walked 
out. 

The tattooed one--Gavriel--sighed quietly. "It's a long tale, Rowan, 
and one you and the King of Adarlan'--a flick of tawny eyes in his 
direction--"must hear." He gestured to the hall and said, utterly stone- 
faced, "You know how cranky Fenrys gets when he doesn't eat." 

"I heard that," called a deep male voice from the hall. 

Dorian reined in his smile, watching Rowan for his reaction instead. But 
the Fae Prince only jerked his head at Gavriel in silent order to lead the 
way. 

None of them, not even Rolfe, spoke as they descended into the main 
room. The barmaid was gone, only sparkling glasses behind the bar hinting 
that she'd been there. And, indeed digging into a steaming bowl of what 
smelled like fish stew, Fenrys now waited for them at a table in the back. 

Gavriel slid into a seat beside the warrior, his mostly full bowl sloshing 
a bit as the table shifted, and said to Rowan when the prince halted halfway 
through the room, "Is..." The Fae warrior paused, as if weighing the words 
and how Rowan might react if the question was posed poorly. Dorian knew 
why the exact next moment. "Is Aelin Galathynius with you?" 

Dorian didn't know where to look: at the warriors now at the table, at 
Rowan beside him, or at Rolfe, brows raised as he leaned against the stair 
banister, with no idea that the queen was his great enemy. 

Rowan shook his head once, a swift, cutting move. "My queen is not in 
our company." 


Fenrys flicked his brows up but continued devouring his meal, his gray 
jacket unbuttoned to reveal the muscled brown chest peeking through the 
vee of his white shirt. Gold embroidery swirled along the lapels of the 
jacket--the only sign of wealth among them. 

Dorian didn't quite know what had happened this past spring with 
Rowan's cadre, but ... they obviously hadn't parted on good terms. At least 
on Rowan's end. 

Gavriel rose to drag over two chairs--closest to the exit, Dorian 
noticed. Perhaps Gavriel was the one who kept the peace among the cadre. 

Rowan didn't make a move for them. It was so easy to forget that the 
prince had centuries of handling foreign courts--had gone to war and back 
again. With these males. 

Rowan didn't bother with diplomacy, however, as he said, "Tell me 
whatever the hell this news is." 

Fenrys and Gavriel exchanged a look. The former just rolled his eyes 
and gestured with his spoon for Gavriel to speak. 

"Maeve's armada sails for this continent." 

Dorian was glad he didn't have anything in his stomach. 

Rowan's words were guttural as he asked, "Is that bitch allying with 
Morath?" He cut what Dorian considered to be the definition of an icy stare 
at Rolfe. "Are you allying with her?" 

"No," Gavriel said evenly. 

Rolfe, to his credit, just shrugged. "I told you, I want no part in this 
war." 

"Maeve isn't the sort to share power," Gavriel cut in calmly. "But before 
we left, she was readying her armada to leave--for Eyllwe." 

Dorian whooshed out a breath. "Why Eyllwe? Is it possible she could be 
sending aid?" 

From the look on Rowan's face, Dorian could tell the prince was 
already cataloging and marking, analyzing what he knew of his former 
queen, of Eyllwe, and how it tied to everything else. 

Dorian tried to control his thundering heart, knowing they could likely 
hear its shift in rhythm. 

Fenrys set down his spoon. "I doubt she's sending aid to anyone at all-- 
at least not where this continent is concerned. And again, she didn't tell us 
her specific reasons." 


99 


"She always tells us," Rowan countered. "She's never contained 
information like that." 

Fenrys's dark eyes flickered. "That was before you humiliated her by 
leaving her for Aelin of the Wildfire. And before Lorcan abandoned her as 
well. She trusts none of us now." 

Eyllwe ... Maeve had to know how dear the kingdom was to Aelin. But 
to launch an armada ... There had to be something there, something worth 
her while. Dorian ran through every lesson he'd been taught, every book 
he'd read on the kingdom. But nothing sparked. 

Rowan said, "Maeve cannot believe she can conquer Eyllwe--at least 
not for any extended period of time, not without drawing all her armies 
here, and leaving her realm undefended." 

But perhaps it'd spread Erawan thin, even if the cost of Maeve's 
invasion would be steep... 

"Again," Fenrys drawled, "we don't know details. We only told him"-- 
a jerk of the chin toward where Rolfe still leaned against the banister with 
crossed arms--"as a courtesy warning--among other things." 

Dorian noted that Rowan didn't ask if they'd have extended the 
courtesy to them had they not been here. Or what, exactly, those other 
things were. The prince said to Rolfe, "I need to dispatch messages. 
Immediately." 

Rolfe studied his gloved hands. "Why bother? Won't the recipient arrive 
soon enough?" 

"What?" Dorian braced himself at the simmering temper in Rowan's 
tone. 

Rolfe smiled. "Rumor has it Aelin Galathynius destroyed General 
Narrok and his lieutenants over in Wendlyn. And that she accomplished this 
with a Fae Prince at her side. Impressive." 

Rowan's canines flashed. "And your point is, Captain?" 

"I just wish to know whether Her Majesty, Queen of Fire, expects a 
grand parade when she arrives." 

Dorian doubted Rolfe would very much like her other title--Adarlan's 
Assassin. 

Rowan's snarl was soft. "Again, she's not coming here." 

"Oh? You mean to tell me that her lover goes to rescue the King of 
Adarlan, and instead of taking him north, he brings him here--and it 


doesn't somehow mean I'm to soon play host to her?" 

At the mention of lover, Rowan gave Fenrys a lethal stare. The beautiful 
male--really, there was no way to describe him other than that--yjust 
shrugged. 

But Rowan said to Rolfe, "She asked me to bring King Dorian to 
persuade you to join our cause. But as you have no interest in any agenda 
but your own, it seems our trip was wasted. So we have no further use for 
you at this table, especially if you're incapable of dispatching messengers." 
Rowan flicked his eyes toward the stairs behind Rolfe. "You're dismissed." 

Fenrys choked on a dark laugh, but Gavriel straightened as Rolfe hissed, 
"I don't care who you are and what power you wield. You don't give me 
orders in my territory." 

"You'd better get used to taking them," Rowan said, his voice calm in 
that way that made Dorian's every instinct prepare to run. "For if Morath 
wins this war, they will not be content to let you flounce about these 
islands, pretending to be king. They will lock you out of every port and 
river, deny you trade with cities that you have come to depend upon. Who 
shall your buyers be when there are none left to purchase your goods? I 
doubt Maeve will bother--or remember you." 

Rolfe snapped, "If these islands are sacked, we will sail to others--and 
others. The seas are my haven--upon the waves, we will always be free." 

"Td hardly call squatting in your tavern in fear of Valg assassins free." 

Rolfe's gloved hands flexed and unfurled, and Dorian wondered if he'd 
go for the rapier at his side. But then the Pirate Lord said to Fenrys and 
Gavriel, "We will meet here tomorrow at eleven." When his gaze shifted to 
Rowan, it hardened. "Send however many damn messages you want. You 
may stay until your queen arrives, which I have no doubt she will. At that 
time, I will hear what the legendary Aelin Galathynius has to say for 
herself. Until then, get the hell out." He jerked his chin toward Gavriel and 
Fenrys. "You can talk to the princes at their own damn lodgings." Rolfe 
stalked to the front door, yanking it open to reveal a wall of rain and the 
four young but hard-looking men lingering on the soaked quay. Their hands 
shot to their weapons, but Rolfe made no move to summon them. He only 
pointed out the door. 

Rowan stared down the man for a moment, then said to his former 
companions, "Let's go." 





They weren't stupid enough to argue. 


This was bad. Undeniably bad. 

Rowan's magic frayed apart as he worked to keep the shields around 
him and Dorian intact. But he didn't let Fenrys or Gavriel get a whiff of that 
exhaustion, didn't reveal one bit of the effort it took to hold the magic and 
concentrate. 

Rolfe might very well be a lost cause against Erawan or Maeve-- 
especially once he saw Aelin. If Aelin had been present during this 
conversation, Rowan had a feeling it would have ended with the Sea 
Dragon--both the inn and the ship anchored in the harbor--aflame. But 
those sea-wyverns ... And Maeve's armada ... He'd think about that later. 
But shit. Just--shit. 

The no-nonsense innkeeper at the Ocean Rose asked no questions as 
Rowan purchased two rooms--the best the inn had to offer. Not when he 
laid a gold piece on the counter. Two weeks' accommodations, plus all 
meals, plus stabling of their horses if they had them, and unlimited laundry, 
she'd offered with a knowing look at his clothes. 

And whatever guests he wished, she added as Rowan whistled sharply, 
and Dorian, Fenrys, and Gavriel crossed the flagstone courtyard, hoods on 
as they edged around the burbling fountain. Rain pattered on the potted 
palms, rustling the magenta bougainvillea crawling up the walls toward the 
white-painted balconies, still shuttered against the storm. 

Rowan asked the woman to send up what was likely enough food for 
eight people, then stalked for the polished stairs at the back of the dim 
dining room, the others falling in behind him. Fenrys, mercifully, kept his 
mouth shut until they reached Rowan's room, discarded their cloaks, and 
Rowan lit a few candles. The act alone left a hole in his chest. 

Fenrys sank into one of the cushioned chairs before the dark fireplace, 
running a finger down the black-painted arm. "Such fine accommodations. 
Which of the royals is paying, then?" 

Dorian, who had been about to claim the seat by the small desk before 
the shuttered windows, stiffened. Gavriel gave Fenrys a look that said, 
Please no brawling. 


"Does it make a difference?" Rowan asked as he went wall to wall, 
lifting the framed pictures of lush flora for any spy holes or access points. 
Then he checked beneath the white-sheeted bed, its posts of twirled black 
wood kissed with the candlelight, trying not to consider that for all his 
resolutions ... she'd share this room with him. This bed. 

The space was secure--serene, even, with the beat of the rain in the 
courtyard and on the roof, the smell of sweet fruit heavy in the air. 

"Someone's got to have money to finance this war," Fenrys purred, 
watching Rowan at last lean against a low dresser beside the door. "Though 
maybe considering yesterday's decree from Morath, you'll be moving to 
more ... economical quarters." 

Well, that said enough about what Fenrys and Gavriel knew regarding 
Erawan's decree concerning Dorian and his allies. "Worry over your own 
business, Fenrys," Gavriel said. 

Fenrys snorted, toying with a small curl of golden hair at his nape. 
"How you even manage to walk with that much steel on you, Whitethorn, 
has always been a mystery to me." 

Rowan said smoothly, "How no one has ever cut out your tongue just to 
shut you up has always been a mystery to me as well." 

An edged chuckle. "I've been told it's my best feature. At least the 
women think so." 

A low laugh escaped Dorian--the first sound like it Rowan had 
witnessed from the king. 

Rowan braced his hands on the dresser. "How did you keep your scents 
hidden?" 

Gavriel's tawny eyes darkened. "A new trick of Maeve's--to keep us 
nearly invisible in a land that does not receive our kind warmly." He jerked 
his chin at Dorian and Rowan. "Though it seems it's not wholly effective." 

Rowan said, "You two better have a damn good explanation for why 
you're here--and why you dragged Rolfe into whatever it is." 

Fenrys drawled, "You get everything you want, Rowan, yet you're still 
a stone-cold bastard. Lorcan would be proud." 

"Where's Connall?" was Rowan's mocking reply, naming Fenrys's 
twin. 

Fenrys's face tightened. "Where do you think? One of us is always the 
anchor." 





"She'd stop keeping him as collateral if you didn't make your 
discontent so obvious." 

Fenrys had always been a pain in his ass. And Rowan had not forgotten 
that 1t was Fenrys who had wanted the task of handling Aelin Galathynius 
this past spring. Fenrys loved anything that was wild and beautiful, and to 
dangle Aelin before him ... Maeve had known it was torture. 

Perhaps it was torture, too, for Fenrys to be so far from Maeve's grip-- 
but to know that his twin was back in Doranelle, that if Fenrys never came 
back ... Connall would be punished in unspeakable ways. It was how the 
queen had ensnared them in the first place: offspring were rare among the 
Fae--but twins? Even rarer. And for twins to be born gifted with strength, 
to grow into males whose dominance rivaled that of warriors centuries older 
than them... 

Maeve had coveted them. Fenrys had refused the offer to join her 
service. So she'd gone after Connall--the dark to Fenrys's gold, quiet to 
Fenrys's roar, thoughtful to Fenrys's recklessness. 

Fenrys got what he wanted: women, glory, wealth. Connall, though 
skilled, was forever in his twin's shadow. So when the queen approached 
him about the blood oath, at a time when Fenrys, not Connall, had been 
selected to fight in the war with the Akkadians ... Connall had sworn it. 

And when Fenrys returned to find his brother bound to the queen, and 
learned what Maeve forced him to do behind closed doors ... Fenrys had 
bargained: he'd swear the oath, but only to get Maeve to back off his 
brother. For over a century now, Fenrys had served in the queen's bedroom, 
had sat chained by invisible shackles beside her dark throne. 

Rowan might have liked the male. Respected him. If it weren't for that 
damned mouth of his. 

"So," Fenrys said, well aware he had not answered Rowan's demand for 
information, "are we soon to call you King Rowan?" 

Gavriel murmured, "Gods above, Fenrys." He gave the sigh of the long- 
suffering and added before Fenrys could open that stupid mouth, "Your 
arrival, Rowan, was a fortunate turn of events." 

Rowan faced the male beside him--second-in-command for Maeve 
now that Rowan had vacated the title. As if the golden-haired warrior read 
the name from his eyes, Gavriel asked, "Where is Lorcan?" 


Rowan had been debating how to answer that question from the moment 
he'd seen them. That Gavriel had asked ... Why had they come to Skull's 
Bay? 

"I don't know where Lorcan is," Rowan said. Not a lie. If they were 
lucky, his former commander would get the other two Wyrdkeys, realize 
Aelin had tricked him, and come running--delivering the two keys for 
Aelin to then destroy. 

If they were lucky. 

Gavriel said, "You don't know where he is--but you've seen him." 
Rowan nodded. 

Fenrys snorted. "Are we really going to play truths and lies? Just tell us, 
you bastard." 

Rowan pinned Fenrys with a look. The White Wolf of Doranelle smiled 
right back at him. 

Gods help them all if Fenrys and Aedion ever sat in a room together. 

Rowan said, "Are you here on Maeve's command--ahead of the 
armada?" 

Gavriel shook his head. "Our presence has nothing to do with the 
armada sailing. She sent us to hunt him. You already know the crime he 
committed." 

An act of love--though only in the twisted way that Lorcan could love 
things. Only in the twisted way he loved Maeve. 

"He claims to be doing it in her best interest," Rowan said casually, 
aware of the king seated beside him. Rowan knew most underestimated the 
sharp intelligence under that disarming smile. Knew that Dorian's value 
wasn't his godlike magic, but his mind. He'd latched on to Rolfe's fear and 
trauma at the hands of the Valg and laid the foundation--one he'd make 
sure Aelin would exploit. 

"Lorcan's always been arrogant that way," Fenrys drawled. "This time, 
he crossed the line." 

"So you've been sent here to bring Lorcan back?" 

Those tattoos on Gavriel's throat--marks Rowan himself had inked-- 
bobbed with each word as he said, ""We've been sent here to kill him." 





Chapter 22


Holy gods. 

Rowan froze. "That explains the two of you, then." 

Fenrys tossed his hair out of his dark eyes. "Three, actually. Vaughan 
left yesterday afternoon to fly north--while we take the South." Vaughan, 
with his osprey form, could cover the far harsher terrain more easily. "We 
landed in this shithole town to see if Rolfe had dealings with Lorcan--to 
bribe him to tip us off if Lorcan should come through here again, looking to 
hire a boat." Skull's Bay would be one of the few ports where Lorcan could 
do such a thing without questions. "Warning Rolfe about Maeve's armada 
was part of convincing the bastard to help us. We're to make our way onto 
the continent from here--start our hunt in the South. And since these lands 
are rather large..." A flash of white teeth in a feral smile. "Any inkling 
about his general whereabouts would be much appreciated, Prince." 

Rowan debated it. But if they caught Lorcan, and the commander had 
possession of even one of the Wyrdkeys ... If they brought both 
commander and keys back to Maeve, especially if she was already sailing 
for Eyllwe for whatever reasons of her own... 

Rowan shrugged. "I washed my hands of you all this spring. Lorcan's 
business is his own." 

"You prick--" Fenrys snarled. 

Gavriel cut in, "If we could bargain?" 

There was something like patn--and regret--in Gavriel's eyes. Of all of 
them, Gavriel had probably been his only friend. 

Rowan debated if he should tell him about the son who now was 
making his way here. Debated if Aedion would like the chance to meet his 
father ... perhaps before war made corpses of them all. 

But Rowan said, "Has Maeve given you leave to bargain on her 
behalf?" 


"We only received our orders," Fenrys drawled, "and the permission to 
use any means necessary to kill Lorcan. She did not mention your queen at 
all. So that amounts to a yes." 

Rowan crossed his arms. "You send me an army of Doranelle warriors, 
and Pll tell you where Lorcan is, and where he plans to go." 

Fenrys let out a harsh laugh. "Mother's tits, Rowan. Even if we could, 
the armada's already in use." 

"I suppose Ill have to make do with you two, then." 

Dorian had the good sense not to look as surprised as Rowan's former 
brothers-in-arms. 

Fenrys burst out laughing. ""What--work for your queen? Fight in your 
battles?" 

"Isn't that what you want, Fenrys?" Rowan fixed him with a stare. "To 
serve my queen? You've been pulling on the leash for months. Well, here's 
your shot." 

All amusement faded from Fenrys's beautiful face. "You're a bastard, 
Rowan." 

Rowan turned to Gavriel. "I'm assuming Maeve didn't specify when 
you had to do this." A shallow nod was his only confirmation. "And you 
will technically be fulfilling her command to you." The blood oath operated 
on specific, clear demands. And relied on close physical contact to enable 
that tug to get the body to yield. This far away ... they had to obey Maeve's 
orders--but could use any loopholes in the language to their own 
advantage. 

"Lorcan might very well be gone by the time you've considered our 
bargain fulfilled,' Fenrys countered. 

Rowan smiled a bit. "Ah, but the thing is ... Lorcan's path will 
eventually lead him right back to me. To my queen. Who knows how long it 
will take, but he will find us again. At which time, he'll be yours." He 
tapped a finger against his bicep. "People are going to be talking about this 
war for a thousand years. Longer." Rowan jerked his chin at Fenrys. 
"You've never shied from a fight." 

"That's if we survive," Fenrys said. "And what of Brannon's gifts? How 
long will a single flame last against the darkness that gathers? Maeve hid 
her motives about the armada and Eyllwe, but she at least told us who really 
reigns in Morath." 


When Rowan had walked through the door of the Sea Dragon, he'd 
wondered what god had sent the storm that had pushed them to arrive in 
Skull's Bay on this day, at this time. 

Together, he and the cadre had taken on a legion of Adarlan's forces this 
spring and won--easily. 

And even if Lorcan, Vaughan, and Connall weren't with them ... One 
Fae warrior was as good as a hundred mortal soldiers. Maybe more. 

Terrasen needed more troops. Well, here was a three-male army. 

And against the aerial Ironteeth legions, they would need Fae speed and 
strength and centuries of experience. 

Together, they had sacked cities and kingdoms for Maeve; together, they 
had waged war and ended it. 

Rowan said, "Ten years ago, we did nothing to stop this. If Maeve had 
sent a force, we might have kept it from growing so out of control. Our 
brethren were hunted and killed and tortured. Maeve let it happen for spite, 
because Aelin's mother would not yield to her wishes. So yes--my 
Fireheart is one flame in the sea of darkness. But she is willing to fight, 
Fenrys. She is willing to take on Erawan, take on Maeve and the gods 
themselves, if it means peace can be had." 

Across the room, Dorian's eyes had shuttered. Rowan knew the king 
would fight--and go down swinging--and that his gift could make a 
difference between victory and defeat. Yet ... he was untrained. Still 
untried, despite all he'd endured. 

"But Aelin is one person," Rowan went on. "And even her gifts might 
not be enough to win. Alone," he breathed, meeting Fenrys's stare, then 
Gavriel's, "she will die. And once that flame goes out, it is done. There is 
no second chance. Once that fire extinguishes, we are all doomed, in every 
land and every world." 

The words were poison on his tongue, his very bones aching at the 
thought of that death--what he'd do if it should happen. 

Gavriel and Fenrys looked at each other, speaking in that silent way he 
used to do with them. There was one card Rowan had to play to convince 
them--to convince Gavriel. 

Even if the specificity of Maeve's command might allow it, she could 
very well punish them for acting around her orders. She'd done it before; 


they all bore scars from it. They knew the risk of it as well as Rowan did. 
Gavriel shook his head slightly at Fenrys. 

Before they could turn to say no, Rowan said to Gavriel, "If you do not 
fight in this war, Gavriel, then you doom your son to die." 

Gavriel froze. 

Fenrys spat, "Bullshit." Even Dorian was gaping a bit. 

Rowan wondered just how pissed Aedion would be as he said, "Think 
on my proposal. But know that your son makes for Skull's Bay. You may 
want to wait to decide until you meet him." 

"Who..." Rowan wasn't sure Gavriel was breathing properly. The 
warrior's hands were clenched so tightly the scars over his knuckles were 
moon white. "I have a son?" 

Some part of Rowan felt like the prick Fenrys claimed he was and not 
the male that Aelin believed him to be as he nodded. 

The information would have gotten out sooner or later. 

If Maeve had learned first, she might have schemed to ensnare Aedion 
--might have sent the cadre to kill or steal him. But now, Rowan supposed, 
he'd ensnared the cadre himself. It was only a matter of how desperately 
Gavriel wanted to meet his son ... and how afraid they were of failing 
Maeve should they not find Lorcan. 

So Rowan said coldly, "Stay out of our way until they arrive and we'll 
stay out of yours." 

Putting his back to them went against every instinct, but Rowan kept his 
shields tight, his magic spread to alert him if either so much as breathed 
wrong while he twisted to open the bedroom door in silent dismissal. He 
had much to do. Starting with writing a warning to the Eyllwe royals and 
Terrasen's forces. Ending with trying to figure out how the hell they could 
fight two wars at once. 

Gavriel rose, slack-faced, pale--something like devastation written 
there. 

Rowan caught the spark of realization that flashed across Dorian's eyes 
a heartbeat before the king buried it. Yes--at first glance, Aedion and Aelin 
looked like siblings, but it was Aedion's smile that gave away his heritage. 
Gavriel would know in a heartbeat ... if Aedion's scent didn't give it away 
first. 


Fenrys stepped closer to the male, a hand on his shoulder as they 
entered the hallway. For both Rowan and Fenrys, Gavriel had always been 
their sounding board. Never each other--no, he and Fenrys ... it was easier 
to be at each other's throats instead. 

Rowan said to both of his former companions, "If you so much as hint 
about Gavriel's son to Maeve, our bargain is over. You'll never find Lorcan. 
And if Lorcan does show up ... PIL gladly help him kill you." Rowan 
prayed it wouldn't come to it--to a fight that brutal and devastating. 

This was war, though. And he had no intention of losing it. 

Chapter 23


The Wind-Singer left Ilium at dawn, its crew and captain unaware that the 
two hooded individuals--and their pet falcon--who had paid in gold had no 
intention of going the entire journey to Leriba. Whether they pieced 
together that those two individuals were also the general and queen who 
had liberated their town the night before, they didn't let on. 

It was considered an easy trip down the coast of the continent, though 
Aelin wondered if voicing that statement would guarantee it wasn t an easy 
trip. First, there was the matter of sailing through Adarlan's waters--near 
Rifthold, specifically. If the witches patrolled far out to sea... 

But they had no other choice, not with the net Erawan had stretched 
across the continent. Not with his threat to find and capture Rowan and 
Dorian still ringing fresh in her mind, along with the throbbing of the deep 
purple bruise on her chest, right over her heart. 

Standing on the deck of the ship, the rising sun staining the turquoise 
bay of Ilium with gold and pink, Aelin wondered if the next time she'd see 
these waters, they'd be red. Wondered how long the Adarlanian soldiers 
would remain on their side of the border. 

Aedion stepped to her side, finished with his third inspection. 
"Everything looks fine." 

"Lysandra said all was clear." Indeed, from high up on the mainmast of 
the ship, Lysandra's falcon eyes missed nothing. 

Aedion frowned. "You know, you ladies can let us males do things 
every now and then." 

Aelin lifted a brow. "Where would the fun be in that?" But she knew 
this would be an ongoing argument--stepping back so that others, so that 
Aedion, might fight for her. It'd been bad enough in Rifthold, bad enough 
knowing that those rings and collars might enslave them--but what Erawan 
had done to that overseer ... as an experiment. 


Aelin glanced toward the scurrying crew, biting back her demand to 
hurry. Every minute delayed could be one that Erawan closed in on Rowan 
and Dorian. It was only a matter of time before a report reached him 
regarding where they'd been spotted. Aelin tapped her foot on the deck. 

The rocking of the ship on the calm waves echoed the beat of her foot. 
She'd always loved the smell and feel of the sea. But now ... even the 
lapping of those waves seemed to say, Hurry, hurry. 

"The King of Adarlan--and Perrington, I suppose--had me in their 
grasp for years," Aedion said. His voice was tight enough that Aelin turned 
from the sea to face him. He'd gripped the wooden railing, the scars on his 
hands stark against his summer-tanned skin. "They met with me in 
Terrasen, in Adarlan. He had me in his rutting dungeon, gods above. And 
yet he didn't do that to me. He offered me the ring but didn't notice I wore 
a fake instead. Why not cleave me open and corrupt me? He had to know-- 
he had to know that you'd come for me." 

"The king left Dorian alone for as long as he could--perhaps that 
goodness extended to you, too. Perhaps he knew that if you were gone, I 
might very well have decided to let this world go to hell and never free him 
for spite." 

"Would you have done that?" 

The people you love are just weapons that will be used against you, 
Rowan had once told her. "Don't waste your energy worrying about what 
could have been." She knew she hadn't answered his question. 

Aedion didn't look at her as he said, "I knew what happened in 
Endovier, Aelin, but seeing that overseer, hearing what he said..." His 
throat bobbed. "I was so close to the salt mines. That year--I was camped 
with the Bane right over the border for three months." 

She whipped her head to him. "We're not starting down this road. 
Erawan sent that man for a reason--for this reason. He knows my past-- 
wants me to know he's aware of it--and will use it against me. Against us. 
He'll use everyone we know, if he needs to." 

Aedion sighed. "Would you have told me what happened last night if I 
hadn't been there?" 

"I don't know. I bet you would have awoken as soon as I unleashed my 
power on him." 

He snorted. "It's hard to miss." 


The crying of gulls swooping overhead filled the quiet that followed. 
Despite her declaration not to linger in the past, Aelin said carefully, 
"Darrow claimed you fought at Theralis." She'd been meaning to ask for 
weeks, but hadn't worked up the nerve. 

Aedion fixed his stare on the churning water. "It was a long time ago." 

She swallowed against the burning in her throat. "You were barely 
fourteen." 

"I was." His jaw tightened. She could only imagine the carnage. And 
the horror--not just of a boy killing and fighting, but seeing the people they 
cared for fall. One by one. 

"I'm sorry," she breathed. "That you had to endure it." 

Aedion turned toward her. No hint of the haughty arrogance and 
insolence. "Theralis is the battlefield I see the most--in my dreams." He 
scratched at a fleck on the rail. "Darrow made sure I stayed out of the thick 
of it, but we were overwhelmed. It was unavoidable." 

He'd never told her--that Darrow had tried to shield him. She put a 
hand atop Aedion's and squeezed. "I'm sorry," she said again. She couldn't 
bring herself to ask more. 

He shrugged with a shoulder. "My life as a warrior was chosen long 
before that battlefield." 

Indeed, she couldn't imagine him without that sword and shield--both 
currently strapped across his back. She couldn't decide if it was a good 
thing. 

Silence settled between them, heavy and old and weary. 

"T don't blame him," Aelin said at last. "I don't blame Darrow for 
blocking me from Terrasen. I would do the same, judge the same, if I were 
him." 

Aedion frowned. "I thought you were going to fight his decree." 

"I am," she swore. "But... I understand why Darrow did it." 

Aedion observed her before nodding. A grave nod, from one soldier to 
another. 

She put a hand against the amulet beneath her clothes. Its ancient, 
otherworldly power rubbed up against her, and a shiver went down her 
spine. Find the Lock. 

Good thing Skull's Bay was on their way to the Stone Marshes of 
Eyllwe. 


And good thing that its ruler possessed a magical map inked on his 
hands. A map that revealed enemies, storms ... and hidden treasure. A map 
to find things that did not wish to be found. 

Aelin lowered her hand, propping both on the rail and examining the 
scar across each palm. So many promises and oaths made. So many debts 
and favors to still call in. 

Aelin wondered what answers and oaths she might find waiting in 
Skull's Bay. 

If they got there before Erawan did. 


Chapter 24 


Manon Blackbeak awoke to the sighing of leaves, the distant call of wary 
birds, and the reek of loam and ancient wood. 

She groaned as she opened her eyes, squinting at the dappled sunlight 
through heavy canopy cover. 

She knew these trees. Oakwald. 

She was still strapped in the saddle, Abraxos sprawled beneath her, neck 
craned so he could monitor her breaths. His dark eyes widened with panic 
as she moaned, trying to sit up. She'd fallen flat onto her back, had 
undoubtedly lain here for some time, judging by the blue blood coating 
Abraxos's sides. 

Manon lifted her head to peer at her stomach and bit back a cry as 
muscles pulled. 

Wet warmth trickled from her abdomen. The wounds had barely set, 
then, if they were tearing so easily. 

Her head pounded like a thousand forges. And her mouth was so dry she 
could barely shift her tongue. 

First order of business: get out of this saddle. Then try to assess herself. 
Then water. 

A stream babbled nearby, close enough that she wondered if Abraxos 
had chosen this spot for it. 

He huffed, shifting in worry, and she hissed as her stomach tore more. 
"Stop," she rasped. "I'm ... fine." 

She wasn't fine, not even close. 

But she wasn't dead. 

And that was a start. 

The other bullshit--her grandmother, the Thirteen, the Crochan claim 

.. She'd deal with it once she didn't have one foot in the Darkness. 

Manon lay there for long minutes, breathing against the pain. 


Clean the wound; staunch the bleeding. 

She had nothing on her but her leathers--but her shirt ... She didn't 
have the strength to boil the linen first. 

She'd just have to pray that the immortality gracing her blood would 
drive off any infection. 

The Crochan blood in her-- 

Manon sat up in a sudden jerk, not giving herself time to balk, biting 
down on her scream so hard her lip bled, a coppery tang filling her mouth. 

But she was up. Blood dribbled from beneath her flying leathers, but 
she focused on unstrapping the harness, one buckle at a time. 

She was not dead. 

The Mother still had some use for her. 

Free of the harness, Manon stared at the drop off Abraxos onto the 
mossy ground. 

Darkness save her, this was going to hurt. 

Just shifting her body to pivot her leg over one side made her clench her 
teeth against the sobbing. If her grandmother's nails had been poisoned, 
she'd be dead. 

But they had been left jagged--jagged instead of honed, and full of rust. 

A large head nudged at her knee, and she found Abraxos there, neck 
stretched--his head just below her feet, the offer in his eyes. 

Not trusting consciousness to keep its grip much longer, Manon slid 
onto his wide, broad head, breathing through the ripples of fiery pain. His 
breath warmed her chilled skin as he gently lowered her onto the grassy 
clearing. 

She lay on her back, letting Abraxos nose her, a faint whine breaking 
from him. 

"Fine ...," she breathed. "I'm..." 


Manon awoke at twilight. 

Abraxos was curled around her, his wing angled to form a makeshift 
covering. 

At least she was warm. But her thirst... 


Manon groaned, and the wing instantly snapped back, revealing a 
leathery head and concerned eyes. "You ... mother hen," she gasped out, 
sliding her arms beneath her and pushing up. 

Oh gods, oh gods, oh gods-- 

But she was in a sitting position. 

Water. That stream... 

Abraxos was too big to reach it through the trees--but she needed 
water. Soon. How many days had it been? How much blood had she lost? 

"Help," she breathed. 

Powerful jaws closed around the collar of her tunic, hoisting her up with 
such gentleness Manon's chest tightened. She swayed, bracing a hand on 
his leathery side, but stayed upright. 

Water--then she could sleep more. 

"Wait here," she said, stumbling to the nearest tree, a hand on her belly, 
Wind-Cleaver a weight on her back. She debated leaving the sword behind, 
but any extra movement, even unbuckling the belt from across her chest, 
was unthinkable. 

Tree to tree, she staggered, nails digging into each trunk to keep herself 
upright, her ragged breathing filling the silent forest. 

She was alive; she was alive... 

The stream was barely more than a trickle through some mossy 
boulders. But it was clear and fast and the most beautiful thing she'd ever 
seen. 

Manon surveyed the water. If she knelt, could she get back up? 

She'd sleep here if she had to. Once she drank. 

Carefully, muscles trembling, she knelt at the bank. She swallowed her 
cry as she bowed over the stream, as more blood slid out. She drank the first 
few handfuls without stop--then slowed, her stomach aching inside and out 
now. 

A twig snapped, and Manon was on her feet, instinct overriding pain so 
fast the agony hit her a breath later. But she scanned the trees, the rocks and 
canopy and little hills. 

A cool female voice said from across the stream, "It seems you have 
fallen far from your aerie, Blackbeak." 

Manon couldn't place who it belonged to, what witch she'd met... 

From behind the shadows of a tree, a stunning young woman emerged. 


Her body was supple yet lithe--her unbound auburn hair draping to 
partially cover her nakedness. Not a stitch of clothing covered that cream- 
colored skin. Not a scar or mark marred flesh as pure as snow. The 
woman's silken hair moved with her as she stepped closer. 

But the woman was no witch. And her blue eyes... 

Run. Run. 

Eyes of glacier blue gleamed even in the shadowed wood. And a full 
red mouth made for the bedroom parted in a too-white smile as she took in 
Manon, the blood, the injury. Abraxos roared in warning, shaking the 
ground, the trees, the leaves. 

"Who are you," Manon said, her voice raw. 

The young woman cocked her head--a robin studying a writhing worm. 
"The Dark King calls me his Bloodhound." 

Manon made every breath count as she rallied her strength. 

"Never heard of you," Manon rasped. 

Something too dark to be blood slithered under the cream-colored skin 
of the woman's abdomen, then vanished. She traced a small, beautiful hand 
over where it had squirmed across the curve of her taut belly. "You would 
not have heard of me. Until your treachery, I was kept beneath those other 
mountains. But when he honed the power within my own blood..." Those 
blue eyes pierced Manon, and it was madness that glittered there. "He could 
do much with you, Blackbeak. So much. He sent me to bring his crowned 
rider to his side once more..." 

Manon backed away a step--just one. 

"There is nowhere to flee. Not with your belly barely inside you." She 
tossed her auburn hair over a shoulder. "Oh, what fun we'll have now that 
I've found you, Blackbeak. All of us." 

Manon braced herself, drawing Wind-Cleaver as the woman's form 
glowed like a black sun, then rippled, the edges expanding, morphing, until 

The woman had been an illusion. A glamour. The creature that stood 
before her had been birthed in darkness, so white she doubted it had ever 
felt the kiss of the sun until now. And the mind that had invented it ... The 
imagination of someone born in another world--one where nightmares 
prowled the dark, cold earth. 


The body and face were vaguely human. But--Bloodhound. Yes, that 
was fitting. The nostrils were enormous, the eyes so large and lidless she 
wondered if Erawan himself had spread her eyelids apart, and her mouth ... 
The teeth were black stumps, the tongue thick and red--for tasting the air. 
And spreading from that white body--the method of Manon's 
transportation: wings. 

"You see," the Bloodhound purred. "You see what he can give you? I 
can now taste the wind; smell its very marrow. Just as I smelled you across 
the land." 

Manon kept an arm cradled over her belly as the other trembled, lifting 
Wind-Cleaver. 

The Bloodhound laughed, low and soft. "I shall enjoy this, I think," she 
said--and pounced. 

Alive--she was alive, and she would stay that way. 

Manon jumped back, sliding between two trees, so close that the 
creature hit them, a wall of wood in her way. Those calf eyes narrowed in 
rage, and her white hands--tipped with earth-digging claws--sank into the 
wood as she backtracked-- 

Only to be stuck. 

Maybe the Mother was watching over her. 

The Bloodhound had lodged herself between the two trees, half in, half 
out, thanks to those wings, wood squeezing-- 

Manon ran. Pain ripped at her with each step, and she sobbed through 
her teeth as she sprinted between the trees. A snap and crash of wood and 
leaves from behind. 

Manon pushed herself, a hand shoved against her wound, gripping 
Wind-Cleaver tight enough it shook. But there was Abraxos, eyes wild, 
wings already flapping, preparing for flight. 

"Go," she rasped, flinging herself at him as wood crunched behind her. 

Abraxos launched for her as she leaped for him--not onto him, but into 
his claws, into the mighty talons that wrapped her under her breasts, her 
stomach tearing a bit more as he hefted her up, up, up, through wood and 
leaf and nest. 

The air snapped beneath her boots, and Manon, eyes streaming, peered 
down to see the Bloodhound's claws reaching wildly. But too late. 


A shriek of rage on her lips, the Bloodhound backed a few steps to the 
edge of the clearing, preparing to get a running leap into the air, as 
Abraxos's wings beat like hell-- 

They cleared the canopy, his wings shattering branches, raining them 
onto the Bloodhound. 

The wind tore at Manon as Abraxos sailed with her, higher and higher, 
heading east, toward the plains--east and south... 

The thing wouldn't be detained long. Abraxos realized it, too. 

Had planned for it. 

A flicker of white broke through the canopy below them. 

Abraxos lunged, a swift, lethal dive, his roar of rage making Manon's 
head buzz. 

The Bloodhound didn't have time to bank as Abraxos's mighty tail 
slammed into her, poison-coated steel barbs hitting home. 

Black festering blood sprayed; ivory membranous wings sundered. 

Then they were sweeping back up and the Bloodhound was tumbling 
down through the canopy--dying or injured, Manon didn't care. 

"I will find you," the Bloodhound screeched from the forest floor. 

It was miles before the screamed words faded. 

Manon and Abraxos paused only long enough for her to crawl onto his 
back and strap herself in. No signs of other wyverns in the skies, no hint of 
the Bloodhound pursuing them. Perhaps that poison would keep her down 
for a while--if not permanently. 

"To the coast," Manon said over the wind as the sky bled crimson into a 
final blackness. "Somewhere safe." 

Blood trickled from between her fingers--faster, stronger than before-- 
only a moment before the Darkness claimed her again. 


Chapter 25 


Even after two weeks in Skull's Bay, being utterly ignored by Rolfe despite 
their requests to meet with him, Dorian still wasn't entirely used to the heat 
and humidity. It hounded him day and night, driving him from sleep to 
wake drenched in sweat, chasing him inside the Ocean Rose when the sun 
was at its zenith. 

And since Rolfe refused to see them, Dorian tried to fill his days with 
things other than complaining about the heat. Mornings were for practicing 
his magic in a jungle clearing a few miles away. Worse, Rowan made him 
run there and back; and when they returned at lunch, he had the "choice" of 
eating before or after one of Rowan's grueling workouts. 

Honestly, Dorian had no idea how Aelin had survived months of this-- 
let alone fallen in love with the warrior while she did. Though he supposed 
both the queen and prince possessed a sadistic streak that made them 
compatible. 

Some days, Fenrys and Gavriel met them in the inn's courtyard to either 
exercise or give unwanted pointers on Dorian's technique with a sword and 
dagger. Some days, Rowan let them stay; others, he kicked them out with a 
snarl. 

The latter, Dorian realized, usually happened when even the heat and 
sun couldn't drive away the shadows of the past few months--when he 
awoke with his sweat feeling like Sorscha's blood, when he couldn't abide 
even the brush of his tunic against his neck. 

He wasn't sure whether to thank the Fae Prince for noticing or to hate 
him for the kindness. 

During the afternoons, he and Rowan prowled the city for gossip and 
news, watching Rolfe's men as closely as they were watched. Only seven 
captains of Rolfe's depleted armada were on the island--eight including 
Rolfe, with fewer ships anchored in the bay. Some had fled after the Valg 


attack; some now slept with the fishes at the bottom of the harbor, their 
ships with them. 

Reports poured in from Rifthold: of the city under witch command, of 
most of it in ruin, its nobility and merchants fleeing to country estates and 
leaving the poor to fend for themselves. The witches controlled the city 
gates and the docks--nothing and no one got in without them knowing. 
Worse, ships from the Ferian Gap were sailing down the Avery toward 
Rifthold, carrying strange soldiers and beasts that turned the city into their 
own personal hunting ground. 

Erawan was no fool with planning this war. Those ships prowling the 
Avery were too small, Rowan had claimed, and there was no way the force 
at the Dead End was the entirety of Erawan's armada. So where had 
Adarlan's fleet been all this time? 

Rowan discovered the answer five days into their stay: the Gulf of Oro. 
Some of the fleet had been positioned near Eyllwe's northwestern coast, 
some hidden in Melisande's ports, where, rumor had it, their queen was 
allowing Morath soldiers in through any direction they pleased. Erawan had 
skillfully divided his fleet, placing it in enough key locations that Rowan 
informed Dorian they'd have to sacrifice land, allies, and geographical 
advantages in order to hold others. 

Dorian had hated to admit to the Fae warrior that he'd never heard any 
of these plans these past years--his council meetings had all been on policy 
and trade and slaves. A distraction, he realized--a way to keep the lords 
and rulers of the continent focused on one thing while other plans were set 
in motion. And now ... if Erawan summoned the fleet from the gulf, they'd 
likely sail around Eyllwe's southern coast and sack every city until they 
reached Orynth's doorstep. 

Perhaps they'd get lucky and Erawan's fleet would collide with 
Maeve's. Not that they'd heard anything of the latter. Not even a whisper of 
where and how fast her ships sailed. Or a whisper of where Aelin 
Galathynius had gone. It was for news of her, Dorian knew, that Rowan 
hunted through the city streets. 

So Dorian and Rowan collected kernels of information and would return 
to the inn each night to analyze them over spiced prawns from the warm 
waters of the archipelago and steaming rice from traders in the southern 
continent, their glasses of orange-infused water resting atop the maps and 


charts they'd purchased in town. Information was mostly second- or third- 
hand--and a common whore patrolling the streets seemed to know as much 
as the sailors laboring at the docks. 

But none of the whores or the sailors or the traders had news of Prince 
Hollin's or Queen Georgina's fates. War was coming--and the fate of a 
child and a flippant queen who had never bothered to take power for herself 
was of little concern to anyone but Dorian, it seemed. 

On a particularly steamy afternoon, cooling off now thanks to a dazzling 
thunderstorm, Dorian set down his fork beside his plate of steamed reef fish 
and said to Rowan, "I find I'm tired of waiting for Rolfe to meet with us." 

Rowan's fork clinked against his plate as he lowered it--and waited 
with preternatural stillness. Where Gavriel and Fenrys were for the 
afternoon, he didn't care. Dorian was actually grateful for their absence as 
he said, "I need some paper--and a messenger." 


Rolfe summoned them and the cadre to the Sea Dragon tavern three hours 
later. 

Rowan had been teaching him about shielding these past few days--and 
Dorian erected one around himself as Rolfe led the four of them along the 
upstairs hall of the tavern, heading for his office. 

His idea had unfolded smoothly--perfectly. 

No one had noticed that the letter Rowan mailed after lunch was the 
same one that was later delivered to Dorian at the inn. 

But Rolfe's spies noticed the shock that Dorian displayed while reading 
it--the dismay and fear and rage at whatever news he'd received. Rowan, 
true to form, had paced and snarled at the news he'd attained. They made 
sure the servant washing the hallway had overheard their mention of the 
war-altering information, that Rolfe himself could gain much from it--or 
lose everything. 

And now, striding for the man's office, Dorian couldn't tell if it pleased 
or unnerved him that they were so closely watched that his plan had 
worked. Gavriel and Fenrys, thankfully, asked no questions. 

The Pirate Lord, clad in a faded blue-and-gold jacket, paused before the 
oak door to his office. His gloves were on, his face a bit haggard. He 


doubted that expression would improve when Rolfe realized there was no 
news whatsoever--and he'd have this meeting whether he wanted to or not. 

Dorian caught the three Fae males assessing Rolfe's each breath, his 
posture, listening to the sounds of the first mate and quartermaster a level 
below. All three exchanged barely perceptible nods. Allies--at least until 
Rolfe heard them out. 

Rolfe unlocked the door, muttering, "This had better be worth my time," 
and stalked into the awaiting dimness beyond. Then stopped dead. 

Even in the watery light, Dorian could perfectly see the woman sitting 
at Rolfe's desk, her black clothes dirty, weapons gleaming, and her feet 
propped on the dark wooden surface. 

Aelin Galathynius, her hands laced behind her head, grinned at them all 
and said, "I like this office far better than your other one, Rolfe." 


Chapter 26


Dorian didn't dare move as Rolfe let out a snarl. "I have a distinct memory, 
Celaena Sardothien, of saying that if you set foot in my territory again, your 
life was forfeit." 

"Ah," Aelin said, lowering her hands but leaving her feet still propped 
on Rolfe's desk, "but where would the fun be in that?" 

Rowan was still as death beside him. Aelin's grin became feline as she 
finally lowered her feet and ran her hands along either side of the desk, 
assessing the smooth wood as if it was a prize horse. She inclined her head 
to Dorian. "Hello, Majesty." 

"Hello, Celaena," he said as calmly as he could, well aware that two Fae 
males behind him could hear his thundering heart. Rolfe whipped his head 
toward him. 

Because it was Celaena who sat here--for whatever purpose, it was 
Celaena Sardothien in this room. 

She jerked her chin at Rolfe. "You've seen better days, but considering 
half your fleet has abandoned you, I'd say you look decent enough." 

"Get out of my chair," Rolfe said too quietly. 

Aelin did no such thing. She just gave Rowan a sultry sweep from foot 
to face. Rowan's expression remained unreadable, eyes intent--near- 
glowing. And then Aelin said to Rowan with a secret smile, "You, I don't 
know. But I'd like to." 

Rowan's lips tugged upward. "I'm not on the market, unfortunately." 

"Pity," Aelin said, cocking her head as she noticed a bowl of small 
emeralds on Rolfe's desk. Don t do it, don t-- 

Aelin swiped up the emeralds in a hand, picking them over as she 
glanced at Rowan beneath her lashes. "She must be a rare, staggering 
beauty to make you so faithful." 

Gods save them all. He could have sworn Fenrys coughed behind him. 


Aelin chucked the emeralds into the metal dish as if they were bits of 
copper, their plunking the only sound. "She must be clever"--plunk--"and 
fascinating" --plunk--"and very, very talented." Plunk, plunk, plunk went 
the emeralds. She examined the four gems remaining in her hand. "She 
must be the most wonderful person who ever existed." 

Another cough from behind him--from Gavriel this time. But Aelin 
only had eyes for Rowan as the warrior said to her, "She is indeed that. And 
more." 

"Hmmm," Aelin said, rolling the emeralds in her scarred palm with 
expert ease. 

Rolfe growled, "What. Are. You. Doing. Here." 

Aelin dumped the emeralds into their dish. "Is that any way to speak to 
an old friend?" 

Rolfe stalked toward the desk, and Rowan trembled with restraint as the 
Pirate Lord braced his hands on the wooden surface. "Last I heard, your 
master was dead and you sold the Guild to his underlings. You're a free 
woman. What are you doing in my city?" 

Aelin met his sea-green eyes with an irreverence that Dorian wondered 
if she had been born with or had honed through skill and blood and 
adventure. "War is coming, Rolfe. Am I not allowed to weigh my options? I 
thought to see what you planned to do." 

Rolfe looked over his broad shoulder at Dorian. "Rumor has it she was 
your Champion this fall. Do you wish to deal with this?" 

Dorian said smoothly, "You will find, Rolfe, that one does not deal with 
Celaena Sardothien. One survives her." 

A flash of a grin from Aelin. Rolfe rolled his eyes and said to the 
assassin-queen, "So, what is the plan, then? You made a bargain to get out 
of Endovier, became the King's Champion, and now that he is dead, you 
wish to see how you might profit?" 

Dorian tried not to flinch. Dead--his father was dead, at his own hands. 

"You know how my tastes run," Aelin said. "Even with Arobynn's 
fortune and the sale of the Guild ... War can be a profitable time for people 
who are smart with their business." 

"And where is the sixteen-year-old self-righteous brat who wrecked six 
of my ships, stole two of them, and destroyed my town, all for the sake of 
two hundred slaves?" 








A shadow flickered in Aelin's eyes that sent a chill down Dorian's 
spine. "Spend a year in Endovier, Rolfe, and you quickly learn how to play 
a different sort of game." 

"I told you"--Rolfe seethed with quiet venom--'that you'd one day 
pay for that arrogance." 

Aelin's smile became lethal. "Indeed I did. And so did Arobynn 
Hamel." 

Rolfe blinked-- just once, then straightened. "Get out of my seat. And 
put back that emerald you slipped up your sleeve." 

Aelin snorted, and with a flash of her fingers, an emerald--the fourth 
one Dorian had forgotten--appeared between her fingers. "Good. At least 
your eyesight isn't failing in your old age." 

"And the other one," Rolfe said through clenched teeth. 

Aelin grinned again. And then leaned back in Rolfe's chair, tipped up 
her head, and spat out an emerald she'd somehow kept hidden under her 
tongue. Dorian watched the gem arc neatly through the air. 

Its plunk in the dish was the only sound. 

Dorian glanced at Rowan. But delight shone in the prince's eyes-- 
delight and pride and simmering lust. Dorian quickly looked away. 

Aelin said to the Pirate Lord, "I have two questions for you." 

Rolfe's hand twitched toward his rapier. "You're in no rutting position 
to ask questions." 

"Aren't I? After all, I made you a promise two and a half years ago. One 
that you signed." 

Rolfe snarled. 

Aelin propped her chin on a fist. "Have you or have any of your ships 
bought, traded, or transported slaves since that ... unfortunate day?" 

"No." 

A satisfied little nod. "And have you provided sanctuary for them 
here?" 

"We haven't gone out of our way, but if any arrived, yes." Each word 
was tighter than the last, a spring about to burst forward and throttle the 
queen. Dorian prayed the man wouldn't be dumb enough to draw on her. 
Not with Rowan watching his every breath. 

"Good and good," Aelin said. "Smart of you, not to lie to me. As I took 
it upon myself when I arrived this morning to look into your warehouses, to 


ask around in the markets. And then I came here..." She ran her hands over 
the papers and books on the desk. "To see your ledgers for myself." She 
dragged a finger down a page containing various columns and numbers. 
"Textiles, spices, porcelain dining ware, rice from the southern continent, 
and various contraband, but ... no slaves. I have to say, I'm impressed. Both 
at you honoring your word and at your thorough record keeping." 

A low snarl. "Do you know what your stunt cost me?" 

Aelin flicked her eyes toward a piece of parchment on the wall, various 
daggers, swords, and even scissors embedded in it--target practice, 
apparently, for Rolfe. "Well, there's the bar tab I left unpaid ... ," she said 
of the document, which was indeed a list of items, and--holy gods, that was 
a large sum of money. 

Rolfe turned to Rowan, Fenrys, and Gavriel. "You want my assistance 
in this war? Here's the cost. Kill her. Now. Then my ships and men are 
yours." 

Fenrys's dark eyes glittered, but not at Rolfe, as Aelin rose to her feet. 
Her black clothes were travel-worn, her golden hair gleaming in the gray 
light. And even in a room of professional killers, she took the lion's share of 
air. "Oh, I don't think they will," she said. "Or even can." 

Rolfe whirled to her. "You'll find that you are not so skilled in the face 
of Fae warriors." 

She pointed to one of the chairs before the desk. "You might want to 
"Get the hell out of--" 

Aelin let out a low whistle. "Allow me to introduce to you, Captain 
Rolfe, the incomparable, the beautiful, and the absolutely and all-around 
flawless Queen of Terrasen." 

Dorian's brows creased. But footsteps sounded, and then-- 

The males shifted as Aelin Galathynius indeed strode into the room, 
clad in a dark green tunic of equal wear and dirt, her golden hair unbound, 
her turquoise-and-gold eyes laughing as she strode past a slack-jawed Rolfe 
and perched on the arm of Aelin's chair. 

Dorian couldn't tell--without a Fae's sense of smell, he couldn't tell. 

"What--what devilry is this," Rolfe hissed, yielding a single step. 

Aelin and Aelin looked at each other. The one in black grinned up at the 
newcomer. "Oh, you are gorgeous, aren't you?" 


sit. 


The one in green smiled, but for all its delight, all its wicked mischief 
... It was a softer smile, made with a mouth that was perhaps less used to 
snarling and teeth-baring and getting away with saying hideous, swaggering 
things. Lysandra, then. 

The two queens faced Rolfe. 

"Aelin Galathynius had no twin," he growled, a hand on his sword. 

Aelin in black--the true Aelin, who had been among them all along-- 
rolled her eyes. "Ugh, Rolfe. You ruin my fun. Of course I don't have a 
twin." 

She jerked her chin at Lysandra, and the shifter's flesh glowed and 
melted, hair becoming a heavy, straight fall of dark tresses, her skin sun- 
kissed, her uptilted eyes a striking green. 

Rolfe barked in alarm and staggered back--only for Fenrys to steady 
him with a hand on his shoulder as the Fae warrior stepped forward, eyes 
wide. "A shifter," Fenrys breathed. 

Aelin and Lysandra fixed the warrior with an unimpressed look that 
would have sent lesser men running. 

Even Gavriel's placid face was slack at the sight of the shape-shifter-- 
his tattoos bobbing as he swallowed. Aedion's father. And if Aedion was 
here with Aelin... 

"As intrigued as I am to see that the cadre is present," Aelin said, "will 
you verify to His Pirateness that I am who I say I am, and we can move on 
to more pressing matters?" 

Rolfe's face was white with fury as he realized they'd all known who 
truly sat before them. 

Dorian said, "She is Aelin Galathynius. And Celaena Sardothien." 

But it was to Fenrys and Gavriel, the outside party, that Rolfe turned. 
Gavriel nodded, Fenrys's eyes now fixed on the queen. "She is who she 
says she is." 

Rolfe turned to Aelin, but the queen frowned up at Lysandra as the 
shifter handed her a wax-sealed tube. "You made your hair shorter." 

"You try hair that long and see if you last more than a day," Lysandra 
said, fingering the hair brushing her collarbone. 

Rolfe gaped at them. Aelin grinned at her companion and faced the 
Pirate Lord. 


"So, Rolfe," the queen drawled, tossing the tube from hand to hand, 
"let's discuss this little business of you refusing to aid my cause." 


Chapter 27 


Aelin Galathynius didn't bother to contain her smugness as Rolfe pointed to 
the large table on the right side of his office--far grander than the piece-of- 
shit office where he'd once had her and Sam meet him. 

She managed all of one step toward her designated seat before Rowan 
was at her side, a hand on her elbow. 

His face--oh, gods, she'd missed that harsh, unyielding face--was tight 
as he leaned in to whisper with Fae softness, "The cadre is working with us 
on the condition that it'll lead them to Lorcan, since Maeve sent them to kill 
him. I refused to divulge his whereabouts. Most of Adarlan's fleet is in the 
Gulf of Oro thanks to some foul agreement with Melisande to use their 
ports, and Maeve's own armada sails for Eyllwe--whether to attack or aid, 
we don't know." 

Well, it was nice to know absolute hell awaited them and that the 
information about Maeve's armada was correct. But then Rowan added, 
"And I missed you like hell." 

She smiled despite what he'd told her, pulling back to look at him. 
Untouched, unharmed. 

It was more than she could have hoped for. Even with the news he'd 
delivered. 

Aelin decided she didn't particularly give a shit who was watching and 
rose up on her toes to brush her mouth against his. It had taken all her wits 
and abilities to avoid leaving traces of her scent today for him to detect-- 
and the shocked delight on his face had been utterly worth it. 

Rowan's hand on her arm tightened as she pulled away. "The feeling, 
Prince," she murmured, "is mutual." 

The others were doing their best not to watch them--save for Rolfe, 
who was still seething. 


"Oh, don't look so put out, Captain," she said, turning away from 
Rowan and sliding into a seat across from Rolfe. "You hate me, I hate you, 
we both hate being told what to do by busybody, overlording empires--it's 
a perfect pairing." 

Rolfe spat, "You nearly wrecked everything I've worked for. Your silver 
tongue and arrogance won't get you through this." 

Just for the hell of it, she smiled and stuck out her tongue. Not the real 
thing--but a forked tongue of silver fire that wriggled like a snake's in the 
air. 

Fenrys choked on a dark laugh. She ignored him. She'd deal with their 
presence later. She just prayed she'd be able to warn Aedion before he ran 
into his father--who was now sitting two seats down from her, gawking at 
her as if she had ten heads. 

Gods, even the expression was like Aedion's. How hadn't she noticed 
that this spring in Wendlyn? Aedion had been a boy the last time she'd seen 
him--but as a man ... With Gavriel's immortality, they even looked the 
same age. Different in many ways, but that look ... it was a reflection. 

Rolfe wasn't smiling. "A queen who plays with fire is not one who 
makes a solid ally." 

"And a pirate whose men abandoned him at the first test of allegiance 
makes for a shit naval commander, yet here I am, at this table." 

"Careful, girl. You need me more than I need you." 

"Do I?" A dance--that was all this was. Long before she'd set foot on 
this horrible island, it had been a dance, and she was now to enter into its 
second movement. She set Murtaugh's sealed letter of recommendation on 
the table between them. "The way I see it, I have the gold, and I have the 
ability to raise you up from a common criminal to a respectable, established 
businessman. Fenharrow can dispute who owns these islands, but ... what if 
I were to throw my support behind you? What if I were to make you not a 
Pirate Lord but a Pirate King?" 

"And who would verify the word of a nineteen-year-old princess?" 

She jerked her chin at the wax-sealed tube. "Murtaugh Allsbrook 
would. He wrote you a nice, long letter about it." 

Rolfe picked up the tube, studied it, and chucked it in a neat arc--tright 
into his rubbish bin. The thud echoed through the office. 


"And I would," Dorian said, leaning forward before Aelin could snarl at 
the ignored letter. "We win this war, and you have the two largest kingdoms 
on this continent proclaiming you the undisputed King of all Pirates. Skull's 
Bay and the Dead Islands become not a hideout for your people, but a 
proper home. A new kingdom." 

Rolfe let out a low laugh. "The talk of young idealists and dreamers." 

"The world," Aelin said, "will be saved and remade by the dreamers, 
Rolfe." 

"The world will be saved by the warriors, by the men and women who 
will spill their blood for it. Not for empty promises and gilded dreams." 

Aelin laid her hands flat on the table. "Perhaps. But if we win this war, 
it will be a new world--a free world. That is my promise--to you, to 
anyone who will march under my banner. A better world. And you will 
have to decide where your place in it shall be." 

"That is the promise of a little girl who still doesn't know how the world 
truly works," Rolfe said. "Masters are needed to maintain order--to keep 
things running and profitable. It will not end well for those who seek to 
upend it." 

Aelin purred, "Do you want gold, Rolfe? Do you want a title? Do you 
want glory or women or land? Or is it just the bloodlust that drives you?" 
She gave a pointed glance at his gloved hands. "What was the cost for the 
map? What was the end goal if that sacrifice had to be made?" 

"There is nothing you can offer or say, Aelin Galathynius, that I cannot 
attain myself." A sly smile. "Unless you plan to offer me your hand and 
make me king of your territory ... which might be an interesting 
proposition." 

Bastard. Self-serving, awful bastard. He'd seen her with Rowan. He was 
drinking in the stillness with which both of them now sat, the death in 
Rowan's eyes. 

"Looks like you bid on the wrong horse," Rolfe crooned. He flicked his 
eyes to Dorian. "What news did you receive?" 

But that wrong horse cut in smoothly, "There was none. But you'll be 
glad to know your spies at the Ocean Rose are certainly doing their job. 
And that His Majesty is quite an accomplished actor." Aelin held in her 
laugh. 

Rolfe's face darkened. "Get out of my office." 


Dorian said coldly, "For a petty grudge, you'd refuse to consider allying 
with us?" 

Aelin snorted. "I'd hardly call wrecking his shit-poor city and ships a 
'petty grudge.'" 

"You have two days to get yourselves off this island," Rolfe said, teeth 
flashing. "After that, my promise from two and a half years ago still holds." 
A sneer at her companions. "Take your ... menagerie with you." 

Smoke curled in her mouth. She had expected debate, but ... It was time 
to regroup--time to see what Rowan and Dorian had done and plan out the 
next steps. 

Let Rolfe think she was leaving the dance unfinished for now. 


Aelin hit the narrow hallway, a wall of muscle at her back and by her side, 
and faced another dilemma: Aedion. 

He was loitering outside the inn to monitor for any unfriendly forces. If 
she stormed right to him, she'd bring him face-to-face with his long-lost, 
completely oblivious father. 

Aelin made it all of three steps down the hall when Gavriel said behind 
her, "Where is he?" 

Slowly, she looked back. The warrior's tan face was tight, his eyes full 
of sorrow and steel. 

She smirked. "If you are referring to sweet, darling Lorcan--" 

"You know who I'm referring to." 

Rowan took a step between them, but his harsh face yielded nothing. 
Fenrys slipped into the hall, shutting Rolfe's office door, and monitored 
them with dark amusement. Oh, Rowan had told her lots about him. A face 
and body women and men would kill to possess. What Maeve made him do, 
what he'd given for his twin. 

But Aelin sucked on a tooth and said to Gavriel, "Isn't the better 
question 'Who is he?'" 

Gavriel didn't smile. Didn't move. Buy herself time, buy Aedion time... 

"You don't get to decide when and where and how you meet him," 
Aelin said. 

"He's my gods-damned son. I think I do." 


Aelin shrugged. "You don't even get to decide if you're allowed to call 
him that." 

Those tawny eyes flashed; the tattooed hands curled into fists. But 
Rowan said, "Gavriel, she does not intend to keep you from him." 

"Tell me where my son is. Now." 

Ah--there it was. The face of the Lion. The warrior who had felled 
armies, whose reputation made wintered soldiers shudder. Whose fallen 
warriors were tattooed all over him. 

But Aelin picked at her nails, then frowned at the now-empty hall 
behind her. "Hell if I know where he's gone off to." 

They blinked, then started as they beheld where Lysandra had once 
been. To where she had now vanished, flying or slithering or crawling out 
of the open window. To get Aedion away. 

Aelin just said to Gavriel, her voice flat and cold, "Don't ever give me 
orders." 


Aedion and Lysandra were already waiting at the Ocean Rose, and as they 
entered the pretty courtyard, Aelin barely dragged up the energy to remark 
to Rowan that she was shocked he hadn't opted for warrior-squalor. 

Dorian, a few steps behind, laughed quietly--which was good, she 
supposed. Good that he was laughing. He had not been the last time she saw 
him. 

And it had been weeks since she'd laughed herself, felt that weight lift 
long enough to do so. 

She gave Rowan a look that told him to meet her upstairs, and halted 
halfway across the courtyard. Dorian, sensing her intent, paused as well. 

The evening air was heavy with sweet fruit and climbing flowers, the 
fountain in the center gurgling softly. She wondered if the owner of the inn 
hailed from the Red Desert--if they'd seen the use of water and stone and 
greenery at the Keep of the Silent Assassins. 

But Aelin murmured to Dorian, "I'm sorry. About Rifthold." 

The king's summer-tanned face tightened. "Thank you--for the help." 

Aelin shrugged. "Rowan's always looking for an excuse to show off. 
Dramatic rescues give him purpose and fulfillment in his dull, immortal 


life." 

There was a pointed cough from the open balcony doors above them, 
sharp enough to inform her that Rowan had heard and wouldn't forget that 
little quip when they were alone. 

She held in her smile. It had been a surprise and a delight, she supposed, 
that an easy, respectful calm flowed between Rowan and Dorian on their 
walk over here. 

She motioned for the king to continue with her and said quietly, well 
aware of how many spies Rolfe employed within the building, "It seems 
you and I are currently without crowns, thanks to a few bullshit pieces of 
paper." 

Dorian didn't return her smile. The stairs groaned beneath them as they 
headed for the second floor. They were almost to the room Dorian had 
indicated when he said, "Maybe that's a good thing." 

She opened and closed her mouth--and opted, for once, to keep quiet, 
shaking her head a bit as she entered the chamber. 

Their meeting was hushed, thorough. Rowan and Dorian laid out in 
precise detail what had happened to them, Aedion pushing for counts of the 
witches, their armor, how they flew, what formations they used. Anything to 
feed to the Bane, to amplify their northern defenses, regardless of who 
commanded them. The general of the North--who would take all those 
pieces and build their resistance. But the sheer ease with which the 
Ironteeth legion had taken the city... 

"Manon Blackbeak," Aedion mused, "would be a valuable ally, if we 
can get her to turn." 

Aelin glanced at Rowan's shoulder--where a faint scar now marred the 
golden skin beneath his clothes. 

"Perhaps getting Manon to turn on her kin would ignite an internal 
battle among the witches," she said. "Maybe they'll save us the task of 
killing them and just destroy each other." 

Dorian straightened in his chair, but only cold calculation swirled in his 
eyes as he countered, "But what is it that they want? Beyond our heads, I 
mean. Why ally with Erawan at all?" 

And all of them then looked to the thin necklace of scars marring the 
base of Aelin's throat--where the scent permanently marked her as a Witch 


Killer. Baba Yellowlegs had visited the castle this winter for that alliance, 
but had there been anything else? 

"We can contemplate the whys and hows of it later," Aelin declared. "If 
we encounter any of the witches, we take them alive. I want some questions 
answered." 

Then she explained what they'd witnessed in Ilium. The order Brannon 
had given her: Find the Lock. Well, he and his little quest could get in line. 

It was never-ending, she supposed while they dined that night on 
peppered crab and spiced rice. This burden, these threats. 

Erawan had been planning this for decades. Maybe for centuries, while 
he'd slept, he'd planned all this out. And she was to be given nothing more 
than obscure commands by long-dead royals to find a way to stop it, 
nothing more than gods-damned months to rally a force against him. 

She doubted it was a coincidence that Maeve was sailing for Eyllwe at 
the same moment Brannon had commanded she go to the Stone Marshes on 
its southwestern peninsula. Or that the gods-damned Morath fleet was 
squatting in the Gulf of Oro--right on its other side. 

There was not enough time, not enough time to do what she needed to, 
to fix things. 

But ... small steps. 

She had Rolfe to deal with. The little matter of securing his people's 
alliance. And the map she still needed to persuade him to use to assist her in 
tracking down that Lock. 

But first ... best to ensure that infernal map actually worked. 


Chapter 28


Too many animals loitering about the streets at this hour would attract the 
wrong sort of attention. 

But Aedion still wished that the shifter was wearing fur or feathers 
compared to ... this. 

Not that she was sore on the eyes as an auburn-haired and green-eyed 
young woman. She could have passed for one of the lovely mountain 
maidens of northern Terrasen with that coloring. It was who Lysandra was 
supposed to be as they waited just inside an alley. Who he was supposed to 
be, too. 

Lysandra leaned against the brick wall, a foot propped against it to 
reveal a length of creamy-white thigh. And Aedion, with his hand braced 
against the wall beside her head, was no more than an hourly customer. 

No sound in the alley but scuttling rats digging through rotten, 
discarded fruit. Skull's Bay was precisely the shithole he expected it to be, 
right down to its Pirate Lord. 

Who now unwittingly held the only map to the Lock that Aelin had 
been commanded to find. When Aedion had complained that of course it 
was a map they could not steal, Rowan had been the one to suggest this ... 
plan. Trap. Whatever it was. 

He glanced at the delicate gold chain dangling around Lysandra's pale 
throat, tracing its length down the front of her bodice, to where the Amulet 
of Orynth was now hidden beneath. 

"Admiring the view?" 

Aedion snapped his eyes up from the generous swells of her breasts. 
"Sorry." 

But the shifter somehow saw the thoughts churning in his head. "You 
think this won't work?" 


"I think there are plenty of valuable things on this island--why would 
Rolfe bother to go after this?" Storms, enemies, and treasure--that was 
what the map showed. And since he and Lysandra were not the first two ... 
only one, it seemed, would be able to appear on that map inked on Rolfe's 
hands. 

"Rowan claimed Rolfe would find the amulet interesting enough to go 
after it." 

"Rowan and Aelin have a tendency to say one thing and mean 
something else entirely." Aedion heaved a breath through his nose. ""We've 
already been here an hour." 

She arched an auburn brow. "Do you have somewhere else to be?" 

"You're tired." 

"We're all tired," she said sharply. 

He shut his mouth, not wanting his head ripped off just yet. 

Each shift took something out of Lysandra. The bigger the change, the 
bigger the animal, the steeper the cost. Aedion had witnessed her morph 
from butterfly to bumblebee to hummingbird to bat within the span of a few 
minutes. But going from human to ghost leopard to bear or elk or horse, 
she'd once demonstrated, took longer between shifts, the magic having to 
draw up the strength to become that size, to fill the body with all its inherent 
power. 

Casual footsteps sounded, accented by a two-note whistle. Lysandra's 
breath brushed against his jaw at the sound. Aedion, however, stiffened 
slightly as those steps grew closer, and he found himself staring at the son 
of his great enemy. King, now. 

But still a face he'd hated, sneered at, debated cutting into tiny pieces 
for many, many years. A face he'd seen drunk out of his mind at parties 
mere seasons ago; a face he'd seen buried against the necks of women 
whose names he'd never bothered to learn; a face that had taunted him in 
that dungeon cell. 

That face was now hooded, and for all the world, he looked like he was 
here to inquire about Lysandra's services--once Aedion had finished with 
her. The general clenched his teeth. "What?" 

Dorian looked over Lysandra, as if surveying the goods, and Aedion 
fought the urge to bristle. "Rowan sent me to see if you had any 
developments." The prince and Aelin were back at the inn, drinking in the 





dining room--where all of Rolfe's spying eyes might see and report them. 
Dorian blinked at the shifter, starting. "And gods above--you really can 
take on any human form." 

Lysandra shrugged, the irreverent street whore debating her rate. "It's 
not as interesting as you'd think. I'd like to see if I could become a plant. 
Or a bit of wind." 

"Can you ... do that?" 

"Of course she can," Aedion said, pushing off the wall and crossing his 
arms. 

"No," Lysandra said, cutting a glare in Aedion's direction. "And there's 
nothing to report. Not even a whiff of Rolfe or his men." 

Dorian nodded, sliding his hands into his pockets. Silence. 

Aedion's ankle barked in pain as Lysandra subtly kicked him. 

He reined in his scowl as he said to the king, "So, you and Whitethorn 
didn't kill each other." 

Dorian's brows scrunched. "He saved my life, nearly got himself burned 
out to do it. Why should I be anything but grateful?" Lysandra gave Aedion 
a smug smile. 

But the king asked him, "Are you going to see your father?" 

Aedion cringed. He'd been glad for their venture tonight to avoid 
deciding. Aelin hadn't brought it up, and he had been content to come out 
here, even if it put him at risk of running into the male. 

"Of course Pll see him," Aedion said tightly. Lysandra's moon-white 
face was calm, steady as she watched him, the face of a woman trained to 
listen to men, to never show surprise-- 

He did not resent what she had been, what she portrayed now, only the 
monsters who had seen the beauty the child would grow into and taken her 
into that brothel. Aelin had told him what Arobynn had done to the man 
she'd loved. It was a miracle the shifter could smile at all. 

Aedion jerked his chin at Dorian. "Go tell Aelin and Rowan we don't 
need their hovering. We can manage on our own." 

Dorian stiffened, but backed down the alley, no more than a disgruntled 
would-be customer. 

Lysandra shoved a hand against Aedion's chest and hissed, "That man 
has endured enough, Aedion. A little kindness wouldn't kill you." 


"He stabbed Aelin. If you knew him as I have, you wouldn't be so 
willing to fawn over--" 
"No one expects you to fawn over him. But a kind word, some respect 


99 


He rolled his eyes. "Keep your voice down." 

She did--but went on, "He was enslaved; he was tortured for months. 
Not just by his father, but by that thing inside of him. He was violated, and 
even if you cannot draw up forgiveness for stabbing Aelin against his own 
will, then try to have some compassion for that." Aedion's heart stuttered at 
the anger and pain on her face. And that word she'd used-- 

He swallowed hard, checking the street behind them. No sign of anyone 
hunting for the treasure they bore. "I knew Dorian as a reckless, arrogant 


99 


"I knew your queen as the same. We were children then. We are allowed 
to make mistakes, to figure out who we wish to be. If you will allow Aelin 
the gift of your acceptance--" 

"I don't care if he was as arrogant and vain as Aelin, I don't care if he 
was enslaved to a demon that took his mind. I look at him and see my 
family butchered, see those tracks to the river, and hear Quinn tell me that 
Aelin was drowned and dead." His breathing was uneven, and his throat 
burned, but he ignored it. 

Lysandra said, "Aelin forgave him. Aelin never once held it against 
him." 

Aedion snarled at her. Lysandra snarled right back and held his stare 
with the face not trained or built for bedrooms, but the true one beneath-- 
wild and unbroken and indomitable. No matter what body she wore, she 
was the Staghorns given form, the heart of Oakwald. 

Aedion said hoarsely, "P1 try." 

"Try harder. Try better." 

Aedion braced his palm against the wall again and leaned in to glower 
in her face. She did not yield an inch. "There is an order and rank in our 
court, lady, and last I checked, you were not number three. You don't give 
me commands." 

"This isn't a battlefield,' Lysandra hissed. "Any ranks are formalities. 
And the last J checked..." She poked his chest, right between his pectorals, 
and he could have sworn the tip of a claw pierced the skin beneath his 


clothes. "You weren't pathetic enough to enforce rank to hide from being in 
the wrong." 

His blood sparked and thrummed. Aedion found himself taking in the 
sensuous curves of her mouth, now pressed thin with anger. 

The hot temper in her eyes faded, and as she retracted her finger as if 
she'd been burned, he froze at the panic that filled her features instead. Shit. 
Shit-- 

Lysandra backed away a step, too casual to be anything but a calculated 
move. But Aedion tried--for her sake, he tried to stop thinking about her 
mouth-- 

"You truly want to meet your father?" she asked calmly. Too calmly. 

He nodded, swallowing hard. Too soon--she wouldn't want a man's 
touch for a long time. Maybe forever. And he'd be damned if he pushed her 
into it before she wanted to. And gods above, if Lysandra ever looked at 
any man with interest like that ... he'd be glad for her. Glad she was 
choosing for herself, even if it wasn't him she picked-- 

"I..." Aedion swallowed, forcing himself to remember what she'd 
asked. His father. Right. "Did he want to see me?" was all he could think to 
ask. 

She cocked her head to the side, the movement so feline he wondered if 
she was spending too much time in that ghost leopard's fur. "He nearly bit 
Aelin's head off when she refused to tell him where and who you are." Ice 
filled his veins. If his father had been rude to her--"But I got the sense," 
Lysandra quickly clarified as he tensed, "that he is the sort of male who 
would respect your wishes if you chose not to see him. Yet in this small 
town, with the company we're keeping ... that might prove impossible." 

"Did you also get the sense that it could persuade him to help us? 
Knowing me?" 

"I don't think Aelin would ever ask that of you," Lysandra said, laying a 
hand on the arm still braced beside her head. 

"What do I even say to him?" Aedion murmured. "I've heard so many 
stories about him--the Lion of Doranelle. He's a gods-damned white 
knight. I don't think he'll approve of a son most people call Adarlan's 
Whore." She clicked her tongue, but Aedion pinned her with a look. "What 
would you do?" 


"I can't answer that question. My own father..." She shook her head. 
He knew about that--the shifter-father who had either abandoned her 
mother or not even known she was pregnant. And then the mother who had 
thrown Lysandra into the street when she discovered her heritage. "Aedion, 
what do you want to do? Not for us, not for Terrasen, but for you." 

He bowed his head a bit, glancing sidelong at the quiet street again. 
"My whole life has been ... not about what I want. I don't know how to 
choose those things." 

No, from the moment he'd arrived in Terrasen at age five, he'd been 
trained--his path chosen. And when Terrasen had burned beneath Adarlan's 
torches, another hand had gripped the leash of his fate. Even now, with war 
upon them ... Had he truly never wanted something for himself? All he'd 
wanted had been the blood oath. And Aelin had given that away to Rowan. 
He didn't resent her for it, not anymore, but ... He had not realized he had 
asked for so little. 

Lysandra said quietly, "I know. I know what that feels like." 

He lifted his head, finding her green eyes again in the darkness. He 
sometimes wished Arobynn Hamel were still altve--just so he could kill the 
assassin-king himself. 

"Tomorrow morning," he murmured. "Will you come with me? To see 
him." 

She was quiet for a moment before she said, "You really want me to go 
with you?" 

He did. He couldn't explain why, but he wanted her there. She got under 
his skin so damn easily, but ... Lysandra steadied him. Perhaps because she 
was something new. Something he had not encountered, had not filled with 
hope and pain and wishes. Not too many of them, at least. 

"If you wouldn't mind ... yes. I want you there." 

She didn't respond. He opened his mouth, but steps sounded. 

Light. Too casual. 

They ducked deeper into the shadows of the alley, its dead-end wall 
looming behind them. If this went poorly... 

If it went poorly, he had a shape-shifter capable of shredding apart 
droves of men at his side. Aedion flashed Lysandra a grin as he leaned over 
her once more, his nose within grazing distance of her neck. 


Those steps neared, and Lysandra loosed a breath, her body going 
pliant. 

From the shadows of his hood, he monitored the alley ahead, the 
shadows and shafts of moonlight, bracing himself. They'd picked the dead- 
end alley for a reason. 

The girl realized her mistake a step too late. "Oh." 

Aedion looked up, his own features hidden within his hood, as Lysandra 
purred to the young woman who perfectly matched Rowan's description of 
Rolfe's barmaid, "Ill be done in two minutes, if you want to wait your 
turn." 

Color stained the girl's cheeks, but she gave them a flinty look, 
scanning them from head to toe. "Wrong turn," she said. 

"You sure?" Lysandra crooned. "A bit late in the evening for a stroll." 

Rolfe's barmaid fixed them with that sharp stare and sauntered back 
down the street. 

They waited. A minute. Five. Ten. No others came. 

Aedion at last pulled away, Lysandra now watching the alley entrance. 
The shifter wound an auburn curl around her finger. "She seems an unlikely 
thief." 

"Some would say similar things about you and Aelin." Lysandra 
hummed in agreement. Aedion mused, "Perhaps she was just a scout-- 
Rolfe's eyes." 

"Why bother? Why not just come take the thing?" 

Aedion glanced again at the amulet that disappeared beneath Lysandra's 
bodice. "Maybe she thought she was looking for something else." 

Lysandra, wisely, didn't fish the Amulet of Orynth out from her dress. 
But his words hung between them as they carefully picked their way back 
to the Ocean Rose. 


Chapter 29


After two weeks of inching across the muddy open plains, Elide was tired 
of using her mother's name. 

Tired of constantly being on alert to hear it barked by Molly to clean up 
after every meal (a mistake, no doubt, to have ever told the woman she had 
some experience washing dishes in busy kitchens), tired of hearing Ombriel 
--the dark-haired beauty not a carnival act at all but Molly's niece and their 
money-keeper--use it when questioning about how she'd hurt her leg, 
where her family came from, and how she'd learned to observe others so 
keenly that she could turn a coin as an oracle. 

At least Lorcan barely used it, as they'd hardly spoken while the 
caravan trudged through the mud-laden fields. The ground was so saturated 
with the daily afternoon summer rain that the wagons often became stuck. 
They'd barely covered any distance at all, and when Ombriel would catch 
Elide gazing northward, she'd ask--yet another recurring question--what 
lay in the North to draw her attention so frequently. Elide always lied, 
always evaded. The sleeping situation between Elide and her husband, 
fortunately, was more easily avoided. 

With the sodden earth, sleeping on it was nearly impossible. So the 
women laid out wherever they could in the two wagons, leaving the men to 
draw straws each night for who would get any remaining space and who 
would sleep on the ground atop a makeshift floor of reeds. Lorcan, 
somehow, always got the short straw, either by his own devices, sleight of 
hand from Nik, who ran security and the nightly straw-drawing, or simply 
from sheer bad luck. 

But at least it kept Lorcan far, far away from her, and kept their 
interactions to a minimum. 

Those few conversations they'd had--held when he escorted her to 
draw water from a swollen stream or gather whatever firewood could be 


found on the plain--weren't much to bother her, either. He pressed her for 
more details regarding Morath, more information about the guards' clothes, 
the armies camped around it, the servants and witches. 

She'd started at the top of the Keep--with the aeries and wyverns and 
witches. Then she'd descended, floor by floor. It had taken them these two 
weeks to work their way down to the sublevels, and their companions had 
no idea that while the young, married couple snuck off for more 
"firewood," whispering sweet nothings was the last thing on their minds. 

When the caravan stopped that night, Elide aimed for a copse of trees in 
the heart of the field to see what could be used at their large campfire. 
Lorcan trailed at her side, as quiet as the hissing grasses around them. The 
nickering of the horses and clamor of their companions readying for the 
evening meal faded behind, and Elide frowned as her boot sank deep into a 
pocket of mud. She yanked on it, ankle barking at bearing her weight, and 
gritted her teeth until-- 

Lorcan's magic pushed against her leg, an invisible hand freeing her 
boot, and she tumbled into him. His arm and side were as hard and 
unyielding as the magic he'd used, and she rebounded away, tall grass 
crunching beneath her. "Thank you," she murmured. 

Lorcan stalked ahead and said without looking back, "We finished at the 
three dungeons and their entrances yesterday night. Tell me about what's 
inside them." 

Her mouth went a bit dry as she recalled the cell she'd squatted in, the 
darkness and tight air... 

"I don't know what's inside," she lied, following him. "Suffering 
people, no doubt." 

Lorcan stooped, his dark head disappearing beneath a wave of grass. 
When he emerged, two sticks were gripped in his massive hands. He 
snapped them with little effort. "You described everything else with no 
problem. Yet your scent changed just now. Why?" 

She strode past him, bending over and over to collect whatever scattered 
wood she could find. "They did horrible things down there," she said over a 
shoulder. "You could sometimes hear people screaming." She prayed 
Terrasen would be better. It had to be. 

"Who did they keep down there? Enemy soldiers?" Potential allies, no 
doubt, for whatever he planned to do. 


"Whoever they wanted to torture." The hands of those guards, their 
sneers-- "I assume you're going to leave as soon as I finish describing the 
last pit of Morath?" She plucked up stick after stick, ankle objecting with 
each shift in her balance. 

"Is there a problem if I do? That was our bargain. I've stayed longer 
than I intended." 

She turned, finding him with an armful of larger sticks. He 
unceremoniously dumped them into the small pile in her arms and thumbed 
free the hatchet at his side before prowling to the curving, fallen branch 
behind him. "So, am I just to play the abandoned wife, then?" 

"You're already playing the oracle, so what difference does another role 
make?" Lorcan brought his hatchet down upon the branch with a solid 
thwack! The blade sank unnervingly deep; wood groaned. "Describe the 
dungeons." 

It was only fair, and it had been their bargain, after all: his protection 
and help to get her out of harm's way, in exchange for what she knew. And 
he'd been complacent in all the lies she'd spun to their company--dquiet, but 
he'd gone along with it. 

"The dungeons are gone," Elide managed to say. "Or most of them 
should be. Along with the catacombs." 

Thwack, thwack, thwack. Lorcan severed the branch, the wood yielding 
with a splintering cry. He set to cutting another section apart. "Taken out in 
that blast?" He lifted his axe, the muscles in his powerful back shifting 
beneath his dark shirt, but paused. "You said you were near the courtyard 
when the blast happened--how do you know the dungeons are gone?" 

Fine. She had lied about it. But ... "The explosion came from the 
catacombs and took out some of the towers. One would assume the 
dungeons would be in its path, too." 

"I don't make plans based on assumptions." He resumed hacking apart 
the branch, and Elide rolled her eyes at his back. "Tell me the layout of the 
northern dungeon." 

Elide turned toward the sinking sun staining the fields with orange and 
gold beyond them. "Figure it out yourself." 

The thud of metal on wood halted. Even the wind in the grasses died 
down. 


But she had endured death and despair and terror, and she had told him 
enough--turned over every horrible stone, looked around every dark corner 
at Morath for him. His rudeness, his arrogance ... He could go to hell. 

She had barely set one foot into the swaying grasses when Lorcan was 
before her, no more than a lethal shadow himself. Even the sun seemed to 
avoid the broad planes of his tan face, though the wind dared ruffle the 
silken black strands of his hair across it. 

"We have a bargain, girl." 

Elide met that depthless gaze. "You did not specify when I had to tell 
you. So I may take as much time as I wish to recall details, if you desire to 
wring every last one of them from me." 

His teeth flashed. "Do not toy with me." 

"Or what?" She stepped around him as if he were no more than a rock 
in a stream. Of course, walking with temper was a bit difficult when every 
other step was limping, but she kept her chin high. "Kill me, hurt me, and 
you'll still be out of answers." 

Faster than she could see, his arm lashed out--gripping her by the 
elbow. "Marion," he growled. 

That name. She looked up at his harsh, wild face 
different age, a different world. "Take your hand off me." 

Lorcan, to her surprise, did so immediately. 

But his face did not change--not a flicker--as he said, "You will tell me 
what I wish to know--" 

The thing in her pocket began thrumming and beating, a phantom 
heartbeat in her bones. 

Lorcan yielded a step, his nostrils flaring delicately. As if he could sense 
that stone awakening. "What are you," he said quietly. 

"I am nothing," she said, voice hollow. Maybe once she found Aelin 
and Aedion, she'd find some purpose, some way to be of use to the world. 
For now, she was a messenger, a courier of this stone--to Celaena 
Sardothien. However Elide might find one person in such an endless, vast 
world. She had to get north--and quickly. 

"Why do you go to Aelin Galathynius?" 

The question was too tense to be casual. No, every inch of Lorcan's 
body seemed restrained. Leashed rage and predatory instincts. 

"You know the queen," she breathed. 


a face born in a 





He blinked. Not in surprise, but to buy himself time. 
He did know--and he was considering what to tell her, how to tell her 


"Celaena Sardothien is in the queen's service," he said. "Your two paths 
are one. Find one and you'll find the other." 

He paused, waiting. 

Would this be her life, then? Wretched people, always looking out for 
themselves, every kindness coming at a cost? Would her own queen at least 
gaze at her with warmth in her eyes? Would Aelin even remember her? 

"Marion," he said again--the word laced with a growl. 

Her mother's name. Her mother--and her father. The last people who 
had looked at her with true affection. Even Finnula, all those years locked 
in that tower, had always watched her with some mixture of pity and fear. 

She couldn't remember the last time she'd been held. Or comforted. Or 
smiled at with any genuine love for who she was. 

Words were suddenly hard, the energy to dredge up a lie or retort too 
much to bother with. So Elide ignored Lorcan's command and headed back 
toward the cluster of painted wagons. 

Manon had come for her, she reminded herself with each step. Manon, 
and Asterin, and Sorrel. But even they had left her alone in the woods. 

Pity, she reminded herself--self-pity would do her no good. Not with so 
many miles between her and whatever shred of a future she stood a chance 
of finding. But even when she arrived, handed over her burden, and found 
Aelin ... what could she offer? She couldn't even read, gods above. The 
mere thought of explaining that to Aelin, to anyone-- 

She'd think on it later. She'd wash the queen's clothes if she had to. At 
least she didn't need to be literate for that. 

Elide didn't hear Lorcan this time as he approached, arms laden with 
massive logs. 

"You will tell me what you know," he said through his teeth. She almost 
sighed, but he added, "Once you are ... better." 

She supposed that, to him, sorrow and despair would be some sort of 
sickness. 

"Fine." 

"Fine," he said right back. 


Their companions were smiling when she and Lorcan returned. They 
had found dry ground on the other side of the wagons--solid enough for 
tents. 

Elide spied the one that had been raised for her and Lorcan and wished 
it would rain. 


Lorcan had trained enough warriors to know when not to push. He'd 
tortured enough enemies to know when they were one slice or snap away 
from breaking in ways that would make them useless. 

So Marion, when her scent had changed, when he'd felt even the 
strange, otherworldly power hidden in her blood shift to sorrow ... worse, 
to hopelessness... 

He'd wanted to tell her not to bother with hope anyway. 

But she was barely into womanhood. Perhaps hope, foolish as it was, 
had gotten her out of Morath. At least her cleverness had, lies and all. 

He'd dealt with enough people, killed and bedded and fought alongside 
enough people, to know Marion wasn't wicked, or conniving, or wholly 
selfish. He wished she was, because it'd make it easier--make his task so 
much easier. 

But if she didn't tell him about Morath, if he broke her from pushing too 
much ... He needed every advantage when he slipped into that Keep. And 
when he slipped out again. 

She'd done it once. Perhaps Marion was the only person alive who had 
managed to escape. 

He was about to explain that to her when he saw what she was staring at 
--the tent. 

Their tent. 

Ombriel came forward, throwing her usual wary glance his way, and 
slyly informed Elide they'd finally have a night alone together. 

Arms full of logs, Lorcan could only watch as that pale face of sorrow 
and despair transformed into youth and mischief, into blushing anticipation, 
as easily as if Marion had held up a mask. She even gave him a flirting 
glance before beaming at Ombriel and rushing to dump her armful of sticks 
and twigs into the pit they'd cleared for the nightly fire. 


He possessed the good sense to at least smile at the woman who was 
supposed to be his wife, but by the time he'd followed to drop his own 
burden into the fire pit, she'd stalked off for the tent set a good distance 
away from the others. 

It was small, he realized with no tiny amount of horror. Probably meant 
for the sword-thrower who'd last used it. Marion's slim figure slipped 
through the white canvas flaps with hardly a ripple. Lorcan just frowned a 
bit before ducking inside. 

And remained ducking slightly. His head would go straight through the 
canvas if he stood to his full height. Woven mats atop gathered rushes 
covered the stuffy interior, and Marion stood on the other side of the tent, 
cringing at the sleeping roll on the makeshift floor. 

The tent probably had enough room for a proper bed and table, if need 
be, but unless they were camping longer than a night, he doubted they'd get 
any of those things. 

"PI sleep on the ground," he offered blandly. "You take the roll." 

"What if someone comes in?" 

"Then you'll say we got into a fight." 

"Every night?" Marion pivoted, her rich eyes meeting his. The cold, 
weary face was back. 

Lorcan considered her words. "If someone walks into our tent without 
permission tonight, no one here will make the same mistake again." 

He'd punished men in his war camps for less. 

But her eyes remained weary--wholly unimpressed and unmoved. 
"Fine," she said again. 

Too close--far too close to the edge of snapping entirely. "I could find 
some buckets, heat water, and you could bathe in here, if you want. Pl 
stand watch outside." 

Creature comforts--to get her to trust him, be grateful to him, to want to 
help him. To ease that dangerous brittleness. 

Indeed, Marion peered down at herself. The white shirt that was now 
dirt-flecked, the brown leather pants that were filthy, the boots... 

"TPI offer Ombriel a coin to wash it all for you tonight." 

"I have no other clothes to wear." 

"You can sleep without them." 

Wariness faded in a flash of dismay. "With you in here?" 


He avoided the urge to roll his eyes. 

She blurted, "What about your own clothes?" 

"What of them?" 

"You ... they're filthy, too." 

"I can wait another night." She'd likely beg to sleep in the wagon if he 
was naked in here-- 

"Why should I be the only one naked? Wouldn't the ruse work better if 
you and I both took the opportunity at once?" 

"You are very young," he said carefully. "And I am very old." 

"How old?" 

She'd never asked. 

"Old." 

She shrugged. "A body is a body. You reek as badly as I do. Go sleep 
outside if you won't wash." 

A test--not driven by any desire or logic, but ... to see if he'd listen to 
her. Who was in control. Get her a bath, do as she asked ... Let her get a 
sense of control over the situation. He gave her a thin smile. "Fine," he 
echoed. 

When Lorcan pushed through the tent again, laden with water, he 
discovered Marion seated on the bedroll, boots off, that ruined ankle and 
foot stretched out before her. Her small hands were braced on the mangled, 
discolored flesh, as if she'd been rubbing the ache from it. 

"How badly does it hurt every day?" He sometimes used his magic to 
brace the ankle. When he remembered. Which wasn't often. 

Marion's focus, however, went right to the steaming cauldron he'd set 
on the floor, then the bucket he'd hauled over a shoulder for her to use as 
well. 

"I've had it since I was a child," she said distantly, as if hypnotized by 
the clean water. She rose on uneven feet, wincing at her wrecked leg. "I 
learned to live with it." 

"That's not an answer." 

"Why do you even care?" The words were barely more than a breath as 
she unbraided her long, thick hair, still fixated on the bath. 

He was curious; he wanted to know how and when and why. Marion 
was beautiful--surely marring her like that had been done with some ill 
intent. Or to prevent something worse. 


She at last cut him a glance. "You said you'd stand watch. I thought you 
meant outside." 

He snorted. Indeed he did. "Enjoy yourself," he said, pushing out of the 
tent once more. 

Lorcan stood in the grasses, monitoring the busy camp, the wide bowl 
of the darkening sky. He hated the plains. Too much open space; too much 
visibility. 

Behind him, his ears picked up the sigh and hiss of leather sliding down 
skin, the rustle of rough-woven cloth being peeled off. Then fainter, softer 
sounds of more delicate fabric sliding away. Then silence--followed by a 
very, very quiet rustling. Like she didn't want even the gods hearing what 
she was doing. Hay crunched. Then a thud of the mattress roll lifting and 
falling-- 

The little witch was hiding something. The hay snapped again as she 
returned to the cauldron. 

Hiding something under the mattress--something she'd been carrying 
with her and didn't want him knowing about. Water splashed, and Marion 
let out a moan of surprising depth and sincerity. He shut out the sound. 

But even as he did, Lorcan's thoughts drifted toward Rowan and his 
bitch-queen. 

Marion and the queen were about the same age--one dark, one golden. 
Would the queen bother at all with Marion once she arrived? Likely, if her 
curiosity was piqued about why she wished to see Celaena Sardothien, but 
... what about after? 

It wasn't his concern. He'd left his conscience on the cobblestones of 
the back streets of Doranelle five centuries ago. He'd killed men who had 
begged for their lives, wrecked entire cities and never once looked back at 
the smoldering rubble. 

Rowan had, too. Gods-damned Whitethorn had been his most effective 
general, assassin, and executioner for centuries. They had laid waste to 
kingdoms and then drunk and bedded themselves into stupors in the 
following days-long celebrations on the ruins. 

This winter, he'd had a damn fine commander at his disposal, brutal and 
vicious and willing to do just about anything Lorcan ordered. 

The next time he'd seen Rowan, the prince had been roaring, desperate 
to fling himself into lethal darkness to save the life of a princess with no 


throne. Lorcan had known--1in that moment. 

Lorcan had known, as he'd pinned Rowan into the grass outside 
Mistward, the prince thrashing and screaming for Aelin Galathynius, that 
everything was about to change. Knew that the commander he'd valued was 
altered irrevocably. No longer would they glut themselves on wine and 
women; no longer would Rowan gaze toward a horizon without some 
glimmer of longing in his eyes. 

Love had broken a perfect killing tool. Lorcan wondered if it would take 
him centuries more to stop being so pissed about it. 

And the queen--princess, whatever Aelin called herself ... She was a 
fool. She could have bartered Athril's ring for Maeve's armies, for an 
alliance to wipe Morath off the earth. Even not knowing what the ring was, 
she could have used it to her advantage. 

But she'd chosen Rowan. A prince with no crown, no army, no allies. 

They deserved to perish together. 

Marion's soaked head popped out of the tent, and Lorcan twisted to see 
the heavy wool blanket wrapped around her like a gown. "Can you bring 
the clothes now?" She chucked her pile out. She'd bundled her underthings 
in her white shirt, and the leathers ... They'd never be dry before morning 
--and would likely shrink beyond use if washed improperly. 

Lorcan stooped, picking up the bundle of clothes and trying not to peer 
into the tent to learn what she'd hidden beneath the bedroll. "What about 
standing guard?" 

Her hair was plastered to her head, heightening the sharp lines in her 
cheekbones, her fine nose. But her eyes were bright again, her full lips once 
more like a rosebud, as she said, "Please get them washed. Quickly." 

Lorcan didn't bother confirming as he carried her clothes away from the 
tent, leaving her to sit in partial nakedness inside. Ombriel was in the 
middle of cooking whatever was in the pot over the fire. Likely rabbit stew. 
Again. Lorcan examined the clothes in his hands. 

Thirty minutes later, he returned to the tent, plate of food in hand. 
Marion was perched on the bedroll, foot stretched out before her, blanket 
tucked under her shoulders. 

Her skin was so pale. He'd never seen such white unmarred skin. 

As if she'd never been let outside. 

Her dark brows furrowed at the plate--then at the bundle under his arm. 


"Ombriel was busy--so I washed your clothes myself." 

She flushed. 

"A body is a body," he repeated simply to her. "So are undergarments." 

She frowned, but her attention was again riveted on the plate. He set it 
down before her. "I got you dinner, since I assumed you didn't want to sit 
among everyone in your blanket." He dumped the pile of clothes on her 
bedroll. "And I got you clothes from Molly. She's charging you, of course. 
But at least you won't sleep naked." 

She dug into the stew without so much as thanking him. 

Lorcan was about to leave when she said, "My uncle ... He is a 
commander at Morath." 

Lorcan froze. And looked right to the bedroll. 

But Marion continued between bites, "He ... locked me in the dungeon 
once." 

The wind in the grasses died; the campfire far beyond their tent 
flickered, the people around it huddling closer together as the nighttime 
insects went silent and the small, furred creatures of the plains scampered 
into their burrows. 

Marion either didn't notice the surge of his dark power, the magic 
kissed by Death himself, or didn't care. She said, "His name is Vernon, and 
he is clever and cruel, and he will likely try to keep you alive if you are 
caught. He wields people to gain power for himself. He has no mercy, no 
soul. There is no moral code that guides him." 

She went back to her food, done for the night. 

Lorcan said quietly, "Would you like me to kill him for you?" 

Her limpid, dark eyes rose to his face. And for a moment, he could see 
the woman she'd become--was already becoming. Someone who, 
regardless of where she'd been born, any queen would prize at her side. 
"Would there be a cost?" 

Lorcan hid his smile. Smart, cunning little witch. "No," he said, and 
meant it. "Why did he lock you in the dungeon?" 

Marion's white throat bobbed once. Twice. She seemed to hold his stare 
through effort of will, through a refusal not to back down from him, but 
from her own fears. "Because he wished to see if his bloodline could be 
crossed with the Valg. That was why I was brought to Morath. To be bred 
like a prize mare." 


Every thought emptied out of Lorcan's head. 

He had seen and dealt and endured many, many unspeakable things, but 
this... 

"Did he succeed?" he managed to ask. 

"Not with me. There were others before me who ... Help came too late 
for them." 

"That explosion was not accidental, was it." 

A small shake of the head. 

"You did it?" He glanced to the bedroll--to whatever she hid beneath. 

Again that shake of the head. "I will not say who, or how. Not without 
risking the lives of the people who saved me." 

"Are the ilken--" 

"No. The ilken are not the creatures that were bred in the catacombs. 
Those ... those came from the mountains around Morath. Through far 
darker methods." 

Maeve had to know. She had to know what they were doing in Morath. 
The horrors being bred there, the army of demons and beasts to rival any 
from legend. She would never ally with such evil--never be foolish enough 
to ally with the Valg. Not when she warred with them millennia ago. But if 
she did not fight ... How long would it be before these beasts were howling 
around Doranelle? Before it was his own continent under siege? 

Doranelle could hold out. But he would likely be dead, once he found 
some way to destroy the keys and Maeve punished him. And with him dead 
and Whitethorn likely carrion, too ... how long would Doranelle last? 
Decades? Years? 

A question snagged in Lorcan's mind, drawing him to the present, to the 
stuffy little tent. "Your foot has been ruined for years, though. He locked 
you in the dungeon that long?" 

"No," she said, not even flinching at his rough description. "I was only 
in the dungeon for a week. The ankle, the chain ... He did that to me long 
before." 

"What chain." 

She blinked. And he knew she'd meant to avoid telling him that one 
particular detail. 

But now that he looked ... he could make out, among the mass of scars, 
a white band. And there, around her perfect, lovely other ankle, was its 


twin. 

A wind laced with the dust and coldness of a tomb gnawed through the 
field. 

Marion merely said, "When you kill my uncle, ask him yourself." 


Chapter 30


Well, on the one hand, at least Rolfe's map worked. 

It had been Rowan's idea, actually. And she might have felt slightly 
guilty for letting Aedion and Lysandra believe the Pirate Lord had only 
gone after the Amulet of Orynth, but ... at least they now knew his unholy 
map functioned. And that the Pirate Lord was indeed living in terror of the 
Valg returning to this harbor. 

She wondered what Rolfe made of it--what his map had shown him of 
the Wyrdkey. If it revealed the difference between it and the Wyrdstone 
rings his men had been enslaved with. Whatever the reason, the Pirate Lord 
had sent his barmaid to scout for any hint of the Valg, not realizing Rowan 
had selected that dead-end alley to ensure only someone sent by Rolfe 
would venture so far down it. And since Aelin had no doubt whatsoever 
that Aedion and Lysandra had snuck through the streets unnoticed ... Well, 
at least that part of her evening had gone right. 

As for the rest of it ... It was just past midnight when Aelin wondered 
how the hell she and Rowan would ever go back to normalcy if they 
survived this war. If there'd be a day when it wasn't easy to leap over 
rooftops as if they were stones on a stream, to break into someone's room 
and hold a blade to the occupant's throat. 

They did the first two within the span of fifteen minutes. 

And as they found Gavriel and Fenrys waiting for them in their shared 
room in the Sea Dragon inn, Aelin supposed she needn't bother with the 
third. Even if both she and Rowan kept their hands within casual reach of 
their daggers while they leaned against the wall beside the now-shut 
window. They'd unlocked it with Rowan's wind--only to have a candle 
ignite the moment the window swung away. Revealing two stone-faced Fae 
warriors, both dressed and armed. 


"You could have used the door," Fenrys said, arms crossed--a bit too 
casually. 

"Why bother when a dramatic entrance is so much more fun?" Aelin 
countered. 

Fenrys's beautiful face twitched with amusement that didn't quite meet 
his onyx eyes. "What a shame it'd be for you to miss out on any of that." 

She grinned at him. He grinned at her. 

She supposed both of their smiles were less of a grin and more ... teeth- 
exposing. 

She snorted. "You two look like you enjoyed your summer in Doranelle. 
How's sweet Aunt Maeve?" 

Gavriel's tattooed hands closed into loose fists. "You deny me the right 
to see my son and yet you barge into our room in the dead of the night to 
demand we divulge information about our blood-sworn queen." 

"One, 7 did not deny you anything, kitty-cat." 

Fenrys let out what might have been a choking sound. 

"It's your son's decision, not mine. I don't have enough time to oversee 
or really care." Lies. 

"It must be hard to find the time to care at all," Fenrys cut in, "when 
you are facing a mortal life span." A sly, cutting glance at Rowan. "Or is 
she due to Settle soon?" 

Oh, he was a bastard. A bitter, hard-edged bastard, the laughing side of 
the coin to Lorcan's sullen brooding. Maeve certainly had a type. 

Rowan's face yielded nothing. "The matter of Aelin's Settling is none of 
your concern." 

"Isn't it? Knowing if she's immortal changes things. Many things." 

"Fenrys," Gavriel warned. 

She knew enough about it--the transition pureblooded Fae, and some 
demi-Fae, went through once their bodies locked into immortal youth. It 
was a rough process, their bodies and magic needing months to adjust to the 
sudden freezing and reordering of their aging process. Some Fae had no 
control over their power--some lost it entirely during the time it took to 
Settle. 

And demi-Fae ... some might be longer-lived, some might have the true 
immortal gift given to them. Like Lorcan. And possibly Aedion. They'd 


find out in the next few years if he'd take after his mother ... or the male 
sitting across the room from her. If they survived the war. 

And as for her ... She did not let herself think about it. Precisely for the 
reasons Fenrys claimed. "I don't see what it would change," she said to 
him. "There's already one immortal queen. Surely a second would be 
nothing new." 

"And will you hand out blood oaths to males who catch your eye, or 
will it just be Whitethorn at your side?" 

She could feel the aggression beginning to pour off Rowan, and she was 
half tempted to grumble, They re your friends. Deal with them. But he kept 
quiet, containing himself, as she said, "You didn't seem nearly so interested 
in me that day at Mistward." 

"Trust me, he was," Gavriel muttered. 

Aelin lifted a brow. But Fenrys was giving Gavriel a look that promised 
a slow death. 

Rowan explained, "Fenrys was the one who ... volunteered to train you 
when Maeve told us you'd come to Wendlyn." 

Was he, now. Interesting. "Why?" 

Rowan opened his mouth, but Fenrys cut him off. "It would have gotten 
me out of Doranelle. And we likely would have had far more fun, anyway. I 
know what a bastard Whitethorn can be when it comes to training." 

"You two would have stayed on that rooftop in Varese and drunk 
yourselves to death,' Rowan said. "And as for training ... You're alive 
today because of that training, boyo." 

Fenrys rolled his eyes. Younger, she realized. Still old by human 
standards, but Fenrys was and felt younger. Wilder. 

"Speaking of Varese," Aelin said with cool amusement. "And 
Doranelle..." 

"I will warn you," Gavriel said quietly, "that there is little we know 
regarding Maeve's plans, and less still we can reveal with the blood oath's 
constraints." 

"How does she do it?" Aelin asked baldly. "With Rowan, it's not ... 
Every order I give him, even casual ones, are his to decide what to do with. 
Only when I actively pull on the bond can I get him to ... yield. And even 
then it's more of a suggestion." 


"It is different with her," Gavriel said softly. "Dependent on the ruler it 
is sworn to. You two took the oath to each other with love in your hearts. 
You had no desire to own or rule him." 

Aelin tried not to flinch at the truth of that word--love. That day ... 
when Rowan had looked into her eyes as he drank her blood ... she'd 
started to realize what it was. That the feeling that passed between them, so 
powerful there was no language to describe it ... It was not mere friendship, 
but something born of and strengthened by it. 

"Maeve," Fenrys added, "offers it with those things in mind. And so the 
bond itself is born of obedience to her--no matter what. She orders, we 
submit. For whatever she wishes." Shadows danced in those eyes, and 
Aelin's fingers curled into fists. That Maeve felt the need to force any of 
them into her bed ... Rowan had told her their familial bloodline, while 
distant, was still close enough that it had kept Maeve from seeking him out, 
but the others... 

"So you couldn't break it on your own." 

"Never--if we did so, the magic that binds us to her would kill us in the 
process," Fenrys said. She wondered if he'd tried. How many times. He 
angled his head to the side, the movement purely lupine. "Why are you 
asking this?" 

Because if Maeve somehow can claim ownership over Aedion's life 
thanks to his bloodline, I can t do a damn thing to help him. 

Aelin shrugged. "Because you sidetracked me." She gave him a little 
smile that she knew drove Rowan and Aedion insane, and--yes. It seemed 
it was a surefire way to piss off any Fae male, because ire flashed across 
Fenrys's stupidly perfect face. 

She picked at her nails. "I know you two are old and up past your 
bedtime, so I'll keep this quick: Maeve's armada sails for Eyllwe. We are 
now allies. But my path might take me into direct conflict with that fleet, 
maybe with her, whether I desire it or not." Rowan had tensed slightly, and 
she wished it wouldn't look weak to glance at him, try to read whatever had 
sparked the reaction. 

Fenrys looked to Rowan--as if it were habit. "I think the bigger concern 
is whether Maeve sails to join Erawan. She could go either way." 

"Our--her network of information is too vast,' Rowan countered. 
"There's not a chance she doesn't already know the empire's fleet is 


camped out in the Gulf of Oro." 

Aelin wondered how often her Fae Prince had to silently correct himself 
about what terms to use. Our, her ... Wondered if he ever missed the two 
males frowning at them. 

"Maeve could be going to intercept it,' Gavriel mused. "Vanquish 
Morath's fleet as proof of her intentions to assist you, then ... play it into 
whatever agenda she has beyond that." 

Aelin clicked her tongue. "Even with Fae soldiers on those ships, she 
couldn't be stupid enough to risk such catastrophic losses just to get into my 
good graces again." No matter that Aelin knew she'd accept any offer of aid 
from Maeve, risk or no. 

Fenrys's edged smile flashed. "Oh, the losses of Fae lives would be of 
little concern to her. It likely just increases her excitement about it." 

"Careful," Gavriel said. Gods, he nearly sounded identical to Aedion 
with that tone. 

Aelin went on, "Regardless. You two know what we face with Erawan; 
you know what Maeve wanted from me in Doranelle. What Lorcan left to 
do." Their faces had resumed their warrior-calm and didn't so much as 
flicker as she asked, "Did Maeve give you an order to take those keys from 
Lorcan as well? And the ring? Or is it just his life you'll be claiming?" 

"If we say she gave us the order to take everything," Fenrys drawled, 
bracing his hands behind him on the bed, "will you kill us, Heir of Fire?" 

"It'll depend on how useful you prove to be as an ally," Aelin simply 
said. 

The weight hanging between her breasts beneath her shirt rumbled as if 
in answer. 

"Rolfe has weapons," Gavriel said quietly. "Or will be receiving them." 

Aelin lifted a brow. "And will hearing about it cost me?" 

Gavriel wasn't stupid enough to ask for Aedion. The warrior just said, 
"They're called firelances. Alchemists in the southern continent developed 
them for their own territory wars. More than that, we don't know, but the 
device can be wielded by one man--to devastating effect." 

And with magic-users still so new to their returned gifts, or mostly dead 
thanks to Adarlan... 

She would not be alone. Not the only fire-wielder on that battlefield. 


But only if Rolfe's armada became hers. If he did what she was 
carefully, so carefully, guiding him to do. Reaching out to the southern 
continent could take months she didn't have. But if Rolfe had already 
ordered a supply ... Aelin nodded at Rowan once more, and they pushed off 
the wall. 

"That's it?" Fenrys demanded. "Do we get to know what you plan to do 
with this information, or are we just your lackeys, too?" 

"You don't trust me; I don't trust you," Aelin said. "It's easier that way." 
She nudged open the window with her elbow. "But thank you for the 
information." 

Fenrys's brows rose high enough that she wondered if Maeve had 
uttered those words in his hearing. And she honestly wished she'd melted 
her aunt that day in Doranelle. 

She and Rowan leaped and climbed the rooftops of Skull's Bay, the 
ancient shingles still slick from the day's rain. 

When the Ocean Rose glittered like a pale jewel a block ahead, Aelin 
paused in the shadows beside a chimney and murmured, "There is no room 
for error." 

Rowan laid a hand on her shoulder. "I know. We'll make it count." 

Her eyes burned. "We're playing a game against two monarchs who 
have ruled and schemed longer than most kingdoms have existed." And 
even for her, the odds of outsmarting and outmaneuvering them ... "Seeing 
the cadre, how Maeve contains them ... She came so close to separating us 
this spring. So close." 

Rowan traced his thumb over her mouth. "Even if Maeve had kept me 
enslaved, I would have fought her. Every day, every hour, every breath." He 
kissed her softly and said onto her lips, "I would have fought for the rest of 
my life to find a way to return to you again. I knew it the moment you 
emerged from the Valg's darkness and smiled at me through your flames." 

She swallowed the tightness in her throat and raised a brow. "You were 
willing to do that before all this? So few benefits back then." 

Amusement and something deeper danced in his eyes. "What I felt for 
you in Doranelle and what I feel for you now are the same. I just didn't 
think I'd ever get the chance to act on it." 

She knew why she needed to hear it--he knew, too. Darrow's and 
Rolfe's words danced around in her head, an endless chorus of bitter 


threats. But Aelin only smirked at him. "Then act away, Prince." 

Rowan let out a low laugh, and said nothing else as he claimed her 
mouth, nudging her back against the crumbling chimney. She opened for 
him, and his tongue swept in, thorough, lazy. 

Oh, gods--this. This was what drove her out of her mind--this fire 
between them. 

They could burn the entire world to ashes with it. He was hers and she 
was his, and they had found each other across centuries of bloodshed and 
loss, across oceans and kingdoms and war. 

Rowan pulled back, breathing heavily, and whispered against her lips, 
"Even when you're in another kingdom, Aelin, your fire is still in my 
blood, my mouth." She let out a soft moan, arching into him as his hand 
grazed her backside, not caring if anyone spotted them in the streets below. 

"You said you wouldn't take me against a tree the first time," she 
breathed, sliding her hands up his arms, across the breadth of his sculpted 
chest. "What about a chimney?" 

Rowan huffed another laugh and nipped at her bottom lip. "Remind me 
again why I missed you." 

Aelin chuckled, but the sound was quickly silenced as Rowan claimed 
her mouth again and kissed her deeply in the moonlight. 


Chapter 31


Aedion had been up half the night, debating the merits of every possible 
place to meet his father. On the beach seemed like it was asking for a 
private conversation he wasn't entirely sure he wanted to have; in Rolfe's 
headquarters felt too public; the inn courtyard felt too formal ... He'd 
tossed and turned on his cot, nearly asleep when he heard Aelin and Rowan 
returning well past midnight. Not surprising they'd snuck out without 
telling anyone. But at least she'd gone with the Fae Prince. 

Lysandra, sleeping like the dead, hadn't stirred as their steps had 
creaked in the hall outside. She'd barely made it through the door hours 
earlier, Dorian already asleep on his cot, before she'd shifted back into her 
usual body and swayed on her feet. 

Aedion had hardly noticed her nakedness--not when she teetered and 
he lunged to grab her before she ate carpet. 

She'd blinked dazedly at him, her skin drained of color. So he'd gently 
set her on the edge of the bed, grabbed the throw across it, and draped it 
around her. 

"You've seen naked women plenty," she'd said, not bothering to hold it 
in place. "It's too hot for wool." 

So the blanket slid off her back as she leaned forward, bracing her 
forearms on her knees and breathing deep. "Gods, it makes me so dizzy." 

Aedion put a hand on her bare back and gently stroked. She stiffened at 
the touch, but he made broad, light circles over that velvet-soft skin. After a 
moment, she let out a sound that might have been a purr. 

The silence went on for long enough that Aedion realized she'd 
somehow fallen asleep. And not normal sleep, but the sleep that Aelin and 
Rowan sometimes went into in order to let their magic recover. So deep and 
thorough no training could pierce it, no instincts could override it. The body 
had claimed what it needed, at any cost, at any vulnerability. 


Easing her into his arms before she could fall right onto her face, 
Aedion hauled her over a shoulder and carried her around to the head of the 
bed. He flipped back the crisp cotton sheets with one hand and then laid her 
down, her once-again long hair covering her high, firm breasts. So much 
smaller than the ones he'd first seen her with. He didn't care what size they 
were--they were beautiful in both forms. 

She hadn't awoken again, and he'd drifted to his own cot. He only slept 
once the light had shifted to the watery gray trickle before dawn, awoke just 
past sunrise, and gave up on sleep entirely. He doubted any sort of rest 
would come until this meeting was past him. 

So Aedion bathed and dressed, debating if it made him a fool to brush 
his hair for his father. 

Lysandra was awake as he padded back into the room, the color 
mercifully returned to her cheeks, the king still asleep on his cot. 

But the shifter looked Aedion over and said, "Thats what you're 
wearing?" 


Lysandra made him change out of his dirty travel clothes, barged into Aelin 
and Rowan's room wearing no more than her own bedsheet, and took 
whatever she wanted from the Fae Prince's armoire. 

Aelin's barked Get out! was likely heard from across the bay, and 
Lysandra was smirking with feline wickedness as she returned, chucking 
the green jacket and pants at him. 

When he emerged from the bathing room, the lady was in clothes of her 
own--where she'd gotten them, he had no idea. They were simple: black, 
tight pants, knee-high boots, and a tucked-in white shirt. She'd left her hair 
half down, half up, and now twisted the silken mass of it over a shoulder. 
Lysandra surveyed him with an approving smirk. "Much better. Much more 
princely and less ... derelict." 

Aedion gave her a mocking bow. 

Dorian stirred, a cool breeze fluttering in as if his magic awoke as well, 
squinted at them both, then at the clock atop the mantel. He hauled the 
pillow over his eyes and went back to sleep. 

"Very kingly," Aedion told him, heading for the door. 


Dorian grumbled something through the pillow that Aedion chose not to 
hear. 

He and Lysandra grabbed a quiet breakfast in the dining room--though 
he had to force half the food down. The shifter asked no questions, either 
from consideration or because she was so busy stuffing her face with every 
single morsel offered at the buffet table. 

Gods, the females in his court ate more than he did. He supposed the 
magic burned through their energy reserves so fast it was a miracle they 
weren't constantly biting his head off. 

They walked to Rolfe's tavern in silence, too, the sentries out front 
stepping aside without so much as a question. He reached for the handle 
when Lysandra finally said, ""You're sure?" 

He nodded. And that was that. 

Aedion opened the door, finding the cadre precisely where he'd guessed 
they'd be at this hour: eating breakfast in the taproom. The two males 
halted as they entered. 

And Aedion's eyes went right to the golden-haired man--one of two, 
but ... there was no denying which one was ... his. 

Gavriel set his fork on his half-eaten plate. 

He wore clothes like Rowan's--and like the Fae Prince, he was heavily 
armed, even at breakfast. 

Aelin was the other side of his fair coin, but Gavriel was a murky 
reflection. The honed, broad features; the harsh mouth--that was where 
he'd gotten them from. The cropped golden hair was different; more 
sunshine to Aedion's shoulder-length honey gold. And Aedion's skin was 
Ashryver golden--not the sun-kissed, deep tan. 

Slowly, Gavriel stood. Aedion wondered if he'd also inherited that 
grace, the predatory stillness, the unreadable, intent face--or if they'd both 
been trained that way. 

The Lion incarnate. 

He'd wanted to do it this way, little more than an ambush, so his father 
wouldn't have time to prepare pretty speeches. He wanted to see what his 
father would do when confronted with him, what sort of male he was, how 
he reacted to anything-- 

The other warrior, Fenrys, was glancing between them, a fork still 
raised to his open mouth. 


Aedion made himself walk, knees surprisingly steady, even if his body 
felt as if it belonged to someone else. Lysandra kept at his side, solid and 
bright-eyed. With every step he took, his father surveyed him, face yielding 
nothing, until-- 

"You look ... ," Gavriel breathed, sinking into his chair. "You look so 
much like her." 

Aedion knew Gavriel didn't mean Aelin. Even Fenrys looked at the 
Lion now, at the grief rippling in those tawny eyes. 

But Aedion barely remembered his mother. Barely recalled anything 
more than her dying, wrecked face. 

So he said, "She died so your queen wouldn't get her claws on me." 

He wasn't sure his father was breathing. Lysandra stepped closer, a solid 
rock in the thrashing sea of his rage. 

Aedion pinned his father with a look, not sure where the words came 
from, the wrath, but there they were, snapping from his lips like whips. 
"They could have cured her in the Fae compounds, but she wouldn't go 
near them, wouldn't let them come for fear of Maeve"--he spat the name 
--'"knowing I existed. For fear I'd be enslaved to her as you were." 

His father's tan face had drained of all color. Whatever Gavriel had 
suspected until now, Aedion didn't care. The Wolf snarled at the Lion, "She 
was twenty-three years old. She never married, and her family shunned her. 
She refused to tell anyone who'd sired me, and took their disdain, their 
humiliation, without an ounce of self-pity. She did it because she loved me, 
not you." 

And he suddenly wished he'd asked Aelin to come, so he could tell her 
to burn this warrior into ashes like that commander in Ilium, because 
looking at the face--his face ... he hated him. He hated him for the twenty- 
three-year-old his mother had been, younger than he now was when she'd 
died, alone and sorrowful. 

Aedion growled, "If your bitch of a queen tries to take me, PI slit her 
throat. If she hurts my family any more than she already has, I'll slit yours, 
too." 

His father rasped, "Aedion." 

The sound of the name his mother had given him on his lips ... "I want 
nothing from you. Unless you plan to help us, in which case I will not 
object to the ... assistance. But beyond that, I want nothing from you." 


"I'm sorry," his father said, those Lion's eyes full of such grief Aedion 
wondered if he'd just struck a male already down. 

"I'm not the one you need to apologize to," he said, turning toward the 
door. 

His father's chair scraped against the floor. "Aedion." 

Aedion kept walking, Lysandra falling into place beside him. 

"Please," his father said as Aedion's hand clamped down on the handle. 

"Go to hell," Aedion said, and left. 

He didn't return to the Ocean Rose. And he couldn't stand to be around 
people, to be around their sounds and smells. So he strode for the dense 
mountain above the bay, losing himself in the jungle of leaves and shade 
and damp soil. Lysandra stayed a step behind him, silent as he was. 

It wasn't until he'd found a rocky outcropping jutting from the side of 
the mountain to overlook the bay, the town, the pristine waters beyond, that 
he paused. That he sat. And breathed. 

Lysandra sat beside him on the flat rock, crossing her legs beneath her. 

He said, "I didn't expect to say any of that." 

She was gazing toward the nearby watchtower nestled at the base of the 
mountain. He watched her green eyes survey the lower level where Ship- 
Breaker was wrapped around a massive wheel, the spiraling exterior 
staircase up the tower itself, all the way up to the upper levels, where a 
catapult, and a turret-mounted, massive harpoon--or was it a giant 
crossbow?--was locked into place, its wielder's seat and arrow aimed at an 
invisible enemy in the bay below. With the size of the weapon and the 
machine that had been rigged to launch it into the bay, he had no doubt it 
could smash through a hull and do lethal damage to a ship. Or spear three 
men on it. 

Lysandra said simply, "You spoke from your heart. Perhaps it's good he 
heard that." 

"We need them to work with us. I might have made an enemy of him." 

She tucked her hair over a shoulder. "Trust me, Aedion, you have not. If 
you'd told him to crawl over hot coals, he would have." 

"He'll realize soon enough who, exactly, I am, and perhaps not be so 
desperate." 

"Who, exactly, do you think you are?" She frowned at him. "Adarlan's 
Whore? Is that what you still think of yourself? The general who held his 


kingdom together, who saved his people when they were forgotten even by 
their own queen--that's the man I know." She snarled softly, and not at 
him. "And if he starts pointing fingers, P' I1 remind him that he's served that 
bitch in Doranelle for centuries without question." 

Aedion snorted. "I'd pay good money to see you go toe-to-toe with him. 
And Fenrys." 

She nudged him with an elbow. "You say the word, General, and P1 
transform into the face of their nightmares." 

"And what creature is that?" 

She gave him a knowing little smile. "Something I've been working 
on." 

"T don't want to know, do I?" 

White teeth flashed. "No, you really don't." 

He laughed, surprised he could even do so. "He's a handsome bastard, 
Pll give him that." 

"I think Maeve likes to collect pretty men." 

Aedion snorted. "Why not? She has to deal with them for eternity. They 
might as well be pleasant to look at." 

She laughed again, and the sound loosed a weight from his shoulders. 


Bearing both Goldryn and Damaris for once, Aelin walked into the Sea 
Dragon two hours later and wished for the days when she could sleep 
without the dread or urgency of something pulling at her. 

Wished for the days when she might have had the time to bed her gods- 
damned lover and not choose to catch a few hours of sleep instead. 

She'd meant to. Last night, they'd returned to the inn, and she'd bathed 
faster than she'd ever washed before. She'd even emerged from the bathing 
room naked ... and found her Fae Prince asleep atop the glowingly white 
bed, still clothed, looking for all the world like he'd intended to close his 
eyes while she washed. 

And the heavy exhaustion on him ... She let Rowan rest. Had curled up 
beside him above the blankets, still naked, and had been unconscious before 
her head had settled against his chest. There would be a time, she knew, 
when they would not be able to sleep so safely, so soundly. 


A grand total of five minutes before Lysandra barged in, Rowan had 
awoken--and begun the process of awakening her, too. Slowly, with 
taunting, proprietary strokes down her bare torso, her thighs, accented with 
little biting kisses to her mouth, her ear, her neck. 

But as soon as Lysandra had thundered through the room to steal clothes 
for Aedion, as soon as she'd explained where Aedion was going ... the 
interruption had lasted. Made her remember what, exactly, she needed to 
accomplish today. With a man currently inclined to kill her and a scattered, 
petrified fleet. 

Gavriel and Fenrys were now sitting with Rolfe at the table in the back 
of the taproom, no sign of Aedion, both a bit wide-eyed as she swaggered 
in. 

She might have preened at the look, had Rowan not prowled in right 
behind her, already prepared to slit their throats. 

Rolfe shot to his feet. "What are you doing here?" 

"I would be very, very careful how you speak to her today, Captain," 
Fenrys said with more wariness and consideration than she'd seen him use 
yesterday. His eyes were fixed on Rowan, who was indeed watching Rolfe 
as if he were dinner. "Choose your words wisely." 

Rolfe glanced at Rowan, saw his face, and seemed to get it. 

Maybe that caution would make Rolfe more inclined to agree to her 
request today. If she played it right. If she'd played all of it right. 

Aelin gave Rolfe a little smile and leaned against the vacant table beside 
theirs, the chipped gold lettering on the slats reading Mist-Cutter. Rowan 
took up a spot beside her, his knee brushing hers. Like even a few feet of 
distance was unbearable. 

But she smiled a bit wider at Rolfe. "I came to see if you'd changed 
your mind. About my alliance." 

Rolfe drummed his tattooed fingers on the table, right over some gilded 
letters that read Thresher. And beside it ... a map of the continent had been 
spread between Rolfe and the Fae warriors. 

Not the map she really, truly needed now that she knew the damn thing 
worked, but--Aelin stiffened at what she beheld. 

"What is that," she said, noting the silver figurines camped across the 
middle of the continent, an impenetrable line from the Ferian Gap to the 


mouth of the Avery. And the additional figures in the Gulf of Oro. And in 
Melisande and Fenharrow and near Eyllwe's northern border. 

Gavriel, looking a bit like someone had knocked him in the head--gods, 
how had the meeting with Aedion gone?---said before Rolfe could get his 
throat ripped out by Rowan with whatever response he had brewing, 
"Captain Rolfe received word this morning. He wanted our counsel." 

"What is this," she said, stabbing a finger near the main line of figures 
stretched across the middle of the continent. 

"It's the latest report,' Rolfe drawled, "of the locations of Morath's 
armies. They have moved into position. Aid to the North is now impossible. 
And they stand poised to strike Eyllwe." 


Chapter 32


"Eyllwe has no standing army," Aelin said, feeling the blood drain from her 
face. "There is nothing and no one to fight after this spring--save for rebel 
militia bands." 

Rowan said to Rolfe, "Do you have exact numbers?" 

"No," the captain said. "The news was given only as a warning--to 
keep any shipments away from the Avery. I wanted their opinions"--a nod 
of the chin toward the cadre--"for handling it. Though I suppose I should 
have invited you, too, since they seem intent on telling you my business." 

None of them deigned to respond. Aelin scanned that line--that line of 
armies. 

Rowan said, "How fast do they move?" 

"The legions departed Morath nearly three weeks ago," Gavriel 
supplied. "They moved faster than any army I've ever seen." 

The timing of it... 

No. No--no, it couldn't be because of Ilium, because she'd taunted 
him... 

"It's an extermination," Rolfe said baldly. 

She closed her eyes, swallowing hard. Even the captain didn't dare 
speak. 

Rowan slid a hand along her lower back, a silent comfort. He knew-- 
was piecing it together, too. 

She opened her eyes, that line burning into her vision, her heart, and 
said, "It's a message. For me." She unfurled her fist, gazing at the scar 
there. 

"Why attack Eyllwe, though?" Fenrys asked. "And why move into 
position but not sack it?" 

She couldn't say the words aloud. That she'd brought this upon Eyllwe 
by mocking Erawan, because he knew who Celaena Sardothien had cared 


for, and he wanted to break her spirit, her heart, by showing her what his 
armies could do. What they would do, whenever he now felt like it. Not to 
Terrasen ... but to the kingdom of the friend she'd loved so dearly. 

The kingdom she had sworn to protect, to save. 

Rowan said, "We have personal ties to Eyllwe. He knows it matters to 
her." 

Fenrys's eyes lingered on her, scanning. But Gavriel, voice steady, said, 
"Erawan now holds everything south of the Avery. Save for this 
archipelago. And even here, he has a foothold in the Dead End." 

Aelin stared at that map, at the space that now seemed so small to the 
north. 

To the west, the vast expanse of the Wastes spread beyond the 
mountainous continental divide. And her gaze snagged on a small name 
along the western coast. 

Briarcliff. 

The name clanged through her, shuddering her awake, and she realized 
they'd been talking, debating how such an army might move so quickly 
over the terrain. 

She rubbed her temple, staring at that speck on the map. 

Considering the life debt owed to her. 

Her gaze dragged down--south. To the Red Desert. Where another life 
debt, many life debts, waited for her to claim them. 

Aelin realized they had asked her something, but she didn't care to 
figure it out as she said quietly to Rolfe, "You're going to give me your 
armada. You're going to arm it with those firelances I know you' ve ordered, 
and you will ship any extras to the Mycenian fleet when they arrive." 

Silence. 

Rolfe barked a laugh and sat again. "Like hell I am." He waved that 
tattooed hand over the map, the waters inked on it churning and changing in 
some pattern she wondered if only he could read. A pattern she needed him 
to be able to read, to find that Lock. "This just shows how utterly 
outmatched you are." He chewed over her words. "The Mycenian fleet is 
little more than a myth. A bedside tale." 

Aelin looked to the hilt of Rolfe's sword, to the inn itself and his ship 
anchored just outside. 


"You are the heir of the Mycenian people," Aelin said. "And I have 
come to claim the debt you owe my bloodline on that account, too." 

Rolfe did not move, did not blink. 

"Or were all the sea dragon references from some personal fetish?" 
Aelin asked. 

"The Mycenians are gone," Rolfe said flatly. 

"I don't think so. I think they have been hiding here, in the Dead 
Islands, for a long, long time. And you somehow managed to claw your 
way back to power." 

The three Fae males were glancing between them. 

Aelin said to Rolfe, "I have liberated Ilium from Adarlan. I took back 
the city--your ancient home--for you. For the Mycenians. It is yours, if 
you dare to claim your people's inheritance." 

Rolfe's hand shook slightly. He fisted it, tucking it beneath the table. 

She allowed a flicker of her magic to rise to the surface then, allowed 
the gold in her eyes to glow like bright flame. Gavriel and Fenrys 
straightened as her power filled the room, filled the city. The Wyrdkey 
between her breasts began thrumming, whispering. 

She knew there was nothing human, nothing mortal on her face. 

Knew it because Rolfe's golden-brown skin had paled to a sickly sheen. 

She closed her eyes and loosed a breath. 

The tendril of power she'd gathered rippled away in an invisible line. 
The world shuddered in its wake. A city bell chimed once, twice, in its 
force. Even the waters in the bay shivered as it swept past and out into the 
archipelago. 

When Aelin opened her eyes, the mortality had returned. 

"What the rutting hell was that?" Rolfe at last demanded. 

Fenrys and Gavriel became very interested in the map before them. 

Rowan said smoothly, "Milady has to release bits of her power daily or 
it can consume her." 

Despite herself, despite what she'd done, she decided she wanted 
Rowan to call her milady at least once every day. 

Rowan continued on, pressing Rolfe about the moving army. The Pirate 
Lord, who Lysandra had confirmed weeks ago was Mycenian thanks to 
Arobynn's own spying on his business partners, seemed barely able to 
speak, thanks to the offer she'd laid out for him. But Aelin merely waited. 





Aedion and Lysandra arrived after some time--and her cousin only 
spared Gavriel a passing glance as he stood over the map and fell into that 
general's mindset, demanding details large and minute. 

But Gavriel silently stared up at his son, watching her cousin's eyes dart 
over the map, listening to the sound of his voice as if it were a song he was 
trying to memorize. 

Lysandra drifted to the window, monitoring the bay. 

Like she could see that ripple Aelin had sent out into the world. 

The shifter had told Aedion by now--of why they had truly gone to 
Ilium. Not only to see Brannon, not only to save its people ... but for this. 
She and the shifter had hatched the plan during the long night watches 
together on the road, considering all pitfalls and benefits. 

Dorian strolled in ten minutes later, his eyes going straight to Aelin. 
He'd felt it, too. 

The king gave a polite greeting to Rolfe, then remained silent as he was 
briefed on the positioning of Erawan's armies. Then he slid into a seat 
beside her while the other males continued discussing supply routes and 
weapons, being led in circle after circle by Rowan. 

Dorian just gave her an unreadable glance and folded his ankle over a 
knee. 

The clock struck eleven, and Aelin rose to her feet in the middle of 
whatever Fenrys had been saying about various armor and Rolfe possibly 
investing in the ore to supply the demand. 

Silence fell again. Aelin said to Rolfe, "Thank you for your hospitality." 

And then turned away. She made it a step before he demanded, "That's 
it?" 

She looked over her shoulder, Rowan approaching her side. Aelin let a 
bit of that flame rise to the surface. "Yes. If you will not give me an armada, 
if you will not unite what is left of the Mycenians and return to Terrasen, 
then Pll find someone else who will." 

"There is no one else." 

Again, her eyes went to the map on his table. "You once said I would 
pay for my arrogance. And I did. Many times. But Sam and I took on your 
entire city and fleet and destroyed it. All for two hundred lives you deemed 
less than human. So perhaps I've been underestimating myself. Perhaps I do 
not need you after all." 


She turned again, and Rolfe sneered, "Did Sam die still pining after you, 
or did you finally stop treating him like filth?" 

There was a choking sound, and a slam and rattle of glasses. She looked 
slowly to find Rowan with his hand around Rolfe's neck, the captain 
pressed onto the map, the figures scattered everywhere, Rowan's snarling 
teeth close to ripping off Rolfe's ear. 

Fenrys smirked a bit. "I told you to choose your words carefully, Rolfe." 

Aedion seemed to be doing his best to ignore his father as he said to the 
captain, "Nice to meet you." Then he strolled toward where Aelin, Dorian, 
and Lysandra waited by the door. 

Rowan leaned in, murmuring something in Rolfe's ear that made him 
blanch, then shoved him a bit harder into the table before stalking for Aelin. 

Rolfe set his hands on the table, pushing up to bark some surely stupid 
words at them, but went rigid. As if some pulse thrashed through his body. 

He turned his hands over, fitting the edges of his palms together. 

His eyes lifted--but not to her. To the windows. 

To the bells that had begun ringing in the twin watchtowers flanking the 
mouth of the bay. 

The frantic pealing set the streets beyond them halting, silencing. 

Each bleat's meaning was clear enough. 

Rolfe's face went pale. 

Aelin watched as black--darker than the ink that had been etched there 
--spread across his fingers, to his palms. Black such as only the Valg could 
bring. 

Oh, there was no doubt now that the map worked. 

She said to her companions, "We leave. Now." 

Rolfe was already storming toward her--toward the door. He said 
nothing as he flung it open, striding onto the quay, where his first mate and 
quartermaster were already sprinting for him. 

Aelin shut the door behind Rolfe and surveyed her friends. And the 
cadre. 

It was Fenrys who spoke first, rising to his feet and watching through 
the window as Rolfe and his men rushed about. "Remind me never to get on 
your bad side." 

Dorian said quietly, "If that force reaches this town, these people--" 


"It won't," Aelin said, meeting Rowan's stare. Pine-green eyes held her 
own. 

Show them why you're my blood-sworn, she silently told him. 

A hint of a wicked smile. Rowan turned to them. "Let's go." 

"Go," Fenrys blurted, pointing to the window. "Where?" 

"There's a boat," Aedion said, "anchored on the other side of the 
island." He inclined his head toward Lysandra. "You'd think they'd notice a 
skiff being tugged out to sea by a shark last night, but--" 

The door banged open, and Rolfe's towering figure filled it. "You." 

Aelin put a hand on her chest. "Me?" 

"You sent that magic out there; you summoned them." 

She barked a laugh, pushing off the table. "If I ever learn such a useful 
talent, I'd use it for summoning my allies, I think. Or the Mycenians, since 
you seem so adamant they don't exist." She glanced over his shoulder--the 
sky was still clear. "Good luck," she said, stepping around him. 

Dorian blurted, "What?" 

Aelin looked the King of Adarlan over. "This isn't our battle. And I 
won't sacrifice my kingdom's fate over a skirmish with the Valg. If you 
have any sense, you won't, either." Rolfe's face contorted with wrath--even 
as fear, deep and true, shone in his eyes. She took a step toward the chaotic 
streets but paused, turning to the Pirate Lord. "I suppose the cadre will be 
coming with me, too. Since they're now my allies." 

Silently, Fenrys and Gavriel approached, and she could have sighed 
with relief that they did so without question, that Gavriel was willing to do 
whatever it took to stay near his son. 

Rolfe hissed, "You think withholding your assistance will sway me into 
helping you?" But far beyond the bay, between the distant, humped islands, 
a cloud of darkness gathered. 

"I meant what I said, Rolfe. I can do fine without you, armada or no. 
Mycenians or no. And this island has now become dangerous for my 
cause." She inclined her head toward the sea. "T 1l offer a prayer to Mala for 
you." She patted the hilt of Goldryn. "A bit of advice, from one 
professional criminal to the other: cut off their heads. It's the only way to 
kill them. Unless you burn them alive, but I bet most would jump ship and 
swim to shore before your flaming arrows can do much damage." 


"And what of your idealism--what of that child who stole two hundred 
slaves from me? You'd leave the people of this island to perish?" 

"Yes," she said simply. "I told you, Rolfe, that Endovier taught me some 
things." 

Rolfe swore. "Do you think Sam would stand for this?" 

"Sam is dead," she said, "because men like you and Arobynn have 
power. But Arobynn's reign is now over." She smiled at the darkening 
horizon. "Seems like yours might end rather soon as well." 

"You bitch--" 

Rowan snarled, taking all of a step before Rolfe flinched away. 

Rushing footsteps sounded, then Rolfe's quartermaster filled the 
doorway. He panted as he rested a hand on the threshold, the other gripping 
the sea dragon-shaped pommel of his sword. "We are knee-deep in shit." 

Aelin paused. Rolfe's face tightened. "How bad?" the captain asked. 

He wiped the sweat from his brow. "Eight warships teeming with 
soldiers--at least a hundred on each, more on the lower levels I couldn't 
see. They're flanked by two sea-wyverns. All moving so fast that it's like 
storm winds carry them." 

Aelin cut a glance at Rowan. "How quickly can we get to that boat?" 

Rolfe was gazing at the few ships in his harbor, his face deathly pale. At 
Ship-Breaker out in the bay, the chain currently beneath the calm surface. 
Fenrys, seeing the captain's stare, observed, "Those sea-wyverns will snap 
that chain. Get your people off this island. Use every skiff and sloop you 
have and get them out." 

Rolfe slowly turned to Aelin, his sea-green eyes simmering with hate. 
And resignation. "Is this an attempt to call my bluff?" 

Aelin toyed with the end of her braid. "No. It's convenient timing, but 
no." 

Rolfe surveyed them all--the power that could level this island if they 
chose. His voice was hoarse as he at last spoke. "I want to be admiral. I 
want this entire archipelago. I want Ilium. And when this war is over, I want 
Lord in front of my name, as it was before my ancestors' names long ago. 
What of my payment?" 

Aelin surveyed him in turn, the entire room deathly quiet compared to 
the chaos of outside. "For every Morath ship you sack, you can keep 
whatever gold and treasure is aboard it. But weapons and ammunition go to 





the front. PII give you land, but no royal titles beyond those of Lord of 
Ilium and King of the Archipelago. If you bear any offspring, I will 
recognize them as your heirs--as I would any children Dorian might bear." 

Dorian nodded gravely. "Adarlan will recognize you and your heirs, and 
this land as yours." 

Rolfe ground out, "You send those bastards down to the inky black, and 
my fleet is yours. I cannot guarantee the Mycenians will rise, though. 
We've been scattered too far and too long. Only a small number live here, 
and they will not stir without proper ... motivation." He glanced toward the 
bar, as if he'd expected to see someone behind it. 

But Aelin held out her hand, smiling faintly. "Leave that to me." 

Tattooed skin met scarred flesh as Rolfe shook her hand. Hard enough 
to break bones, but she did it right back. Sent a little flame searing into his 
fingers. 

He hissed, pulling back his hand, and Aelin grinned. "Welcome to Her 
Majesty's army, Privateer Rolfe." She gestured to the open door. "Shall 
we?" 





Aelin was insane, Dorian realized. Brilliant and wicked, but insane. 

And perhaps the greatest, most unremorseful liar he'd ever encountered. 

He'd felt her summons sweep through the world. Felt fire hum against 
his skin. There was no mistaking who it belonged to. And there was no 
mistaking that it had gone right to the Dead End, where the forces dwelling 
there would know there was one person alive with that kind of flame at her 
disposal, and track the magic back here. 

He didn't know what had triggered it, why she'd chosen now, but-- 

But Rowan had informed Aelin how the Valg haunted Rolfe. How he 
had this city watched day and night, terrified of their return. So Aelin had 
used it to her advantage. The Mycenians--holy gods. They were little more 
than a bedtime story and cautionary tale. But here they were, carefully 
hidden away. Until Aelin had smoked them out. 

And as the Pirate Lord and Queen of Terrasen shook hands and she 
grinned at Rolfe, Dorian realized he ... perhaps he could do with a bit more 
wickedness and insanity, too. 


This war would not be won on smiles and manners. 

It would be won by a woman willing to gamble with an entire island 
full of people to get what she needed to save them all. A woman whose 
friends were equally willing to play along, to rip their souls to shreds if it 
meant saving the greater population. They knew the weight of the lives 
panicking around them if they gambled wrong. Aelin perhaps more than 
anyone else. 

Aelin and Rolfe stalked through the open tavern doorway and into the 
street beyond. Behind him, Fenrys let out a low whistle. "Gods help you, 
Rowan, that woman is..." 

Dorian didn't wait to hear the rest as he followed the pirate and the 
queen into the street, Aedion and Lysandra trailing. Fenrys kept at a 
distance from the others, but Gavriel remained close, his gaze still fixed on 
his son. Gods, they looked so much alike, moved alike, the Lion and the 
Wolf. 

Rolfe barked to his men waiting in a line before him, "Every ship that 
can bear men sails now." He rattled off orders, delegating his men to 
various ships long bereft of crew to run them, including his own, while 
Aelin stood there, hands braced on her hips, watching them all. 

She said to the captain, "What's your fastest ship?" 

He pointed at his own. 

She held his stare, and Dorian waited for the wild, reckless plan. But 
she said without looking at any of them, "Rowan, Lysandra, Fenrys, and 
Gavriel, you're with me. Aedion, you get on the northern watchtower and 
man the mounted harpoon. Any ship gets too close to the chain, you blast a 
hole through their gods-damned side." Dorian stiffened as she at last 
addressed him, seeing the orders already in her eyes. He opened his mouth 
to object, but Aelin said simply, "This battle is no place for a king." 

"And it's one for a queen?" 

There was no amusement, nothing but icy calm as she handed him a 
sword he hadn't realized she'd been carrying at her side. Damaris. 

Goldryn was still strapped across her back, its ruby glowing like a living 
ember as she said, "One of us has to live, Dorian. You take the southern 
watchtower--stay at the base, and get your magic ready. Any forces that try 
to cross the chain, you take them out." 


Not with steel, but magic. He fastened Damaris to his sword belt, its 
weight foreign. "And what are you going to do?" he demanded. As if in 
answer, his power writhed in his gut, like an asp curling to strike. 

Aelin glanced at Rowan, at his tattooed hand. "Rolfe, get whatever iron 
chains you have left from your slave-mongering. We're going to need 
them." 

For her--for Rowan. As a check against their magic, if it got out of 
control. 

Because Aelin ... Aelin was going to sail that ship right into the heart of 
the enemy fleet and blow them all out of the water. 


Chapter 33


She was a liar, and a murderer, and a thief, and Aelin had a feeling she'd be 
called much worse by the end of this war. But as that unnatural darkness 
gathered on the horizon, she wondered if she might have bitten off more 
than she and all her fanged friends could chew. 

She did not give her fear an inch of space. 

Did not do anything but let black fire ripple through her. 

Securing this alliance was only part of it. The other part, the bigger part 
... was the message. Not to Morath. 

But to the world. 

To any potential allies watching this continent, contemplating if it was 
indeed a lost cause. 

Today her message would thunder across the realms. 

She was not a rebel princess, shattering enemy castles and killing kings. 

She was a force of nature. She was a calamity and a commander of 
immortal warriors of legend. And if those allies did not join with her ... she 
wanted them to think of today, of what she would do, and wonder if they 
might find her on their shores, in their harbors, one day, too. 

They had not come ten years ago. She wanted them to know she had not 
forgotten it. 

Rolfe finished barking orders to his men and rushed aboard the Sea 
Dragon, Aedion and Dorian hurtling for horses to carry them to their 
respective watchtowers. Aelin turned to Lysandra, the shifter calmly 
monitoring all. Aelin said quietly, "Do you know what I need you to do?" 

Lysandra's moss-green eyes were bright as she nodded. 

Aelin did not allow herself to embrace the shifter. Did not allow herself 
to so much as touch her friend's hand. Not with Rolfe watching. Not with 
the citizens of this town watching, the lost Mycenians among them. So 
Aelin merely said, "Good hunting." 


Fenrys let out a choked sound, as if he realized what she had indeed 
demanded of the shape-shifter. Beside him, Gavriel was still too busy 
staring after Aedion, who hadn't so much as glanced at his father before 
fastening his shield and sword across his back, mounting a sorry-looking 
mare, and galloping for the watchtower. 

Aelin said to Rowan, the wind already dancing in the silver hair of her 
watrior-prince, "We move now." 

So they did. 

People were panicking in the streets as the dark force took shape on the 
horizon: massive ships with black sails, converging on the bay as if they 
were indeed carried on a preternatural wind. 

But Aelin, Lysandra close to her, stalked for the towering Sea Dragon, 
Rowan and his two companions falling into step behind them. 

People halted and gawked while they ascended the gangway, securing 
and rearranging their weapons. Knives and swords, Rowan's hatchet 
gleaming while he hooked it at his side, a bow and quiver full of black- 
feathered arrows that Aelin assumed Fenrys could fire with deadly 
accuracy, and more blades. As they prowled onto the gently rocking deck of 
the Sea Dragon, the wood meticulously polished, Aelin supposed that 
together they formed a walking armory. 

Gavriel had no sooner set foot on board than the gangway was hauled 
up by Rolfe's men. The others, seated on benches flanking the deck, lifted 
oars, two men to a seat. Rowan jerked his chin at Gavriel and Fenrys, and 
the two wordlessly went to join the men, his cadre falling into rank and 
rhythms that were older than some kingdoms. 

Rolfe stalked out a door that no doubt led to his chambers, two men 
behind him bearing enormous iron chains. 

Aelin strode for them. "Anchor them to the mainmast and make sure 
there's enough room for them to reach right ... here." She pointed to where 
she now stood in the heart of the deck. Enough space clear of everyone, 
enough space for her and Rowan to work. 

Rolfe barked an order to begin rowing, glancing once at Fenrys and 
Gavriel--who each manned an oar themselves, teeth bared as they threw 
their considerable strength into the motion. 

Slowly, the ship began moving--the others around them stirring as well. 


But they had to be out of the bay first, had to get past the boundary of 
Ship-Breaker. 

Rolfe's men looped the chains around the mast, leaving enough length 
to reach Aelin. 

Iron would provide a bite, an anchor to remind her who she was, what 
she was. Iron would keep her tethered when the sheer vastness of her 
magic, of Rowan's magic, threatened to sweep her away. 

The Sea Dragon inched over the harbor, the call and grunting of Rolfe's 
men as they rowed drowning out the din of the town behind them. 

She flicked a glance toward either watchtower to see Dorian arrive-- 
then Aedion's golden hair racing up the outer spiral staircase to the 
enormous mounted harpoon at the top. Her heart strained for a moment as 
she flashed between now and a time when she'd seen Sam running up those 
same stairs--not to defend this town, but to wreck it. 

She shook off the icy grip of memory and turned to Lysandra, standing 
at the deck rail, watching her cousin as well. "Now." 

Even Rolfe paused his ordering at the word. 

Lysandra gracefully sat on the broad wooden railing, pivoted her legs 
over the side ... and dropped into the water. 

Rolfe's men rushed to the rail. People in boats flanking them did the 
same, spotting the woman plunge into the vivid blue. 

But it was not a woman who came out. 

Below, deep down, Aelin could make out the glow and shift and spread. 
Men began cursing. 

But Lysandra kept growing and growing beneath the surface, along the 
sandy harbor floor. 

Faster, the men rowed. 

But the ship's speed was nothing compared to the speed of the creature 
that emerged from the waves. 

A broad jade-green snout, peppered with shredding white teeth, huffed a 
mighty breath then arced back under the water, revealing a flash of a 
massive head and cunning eyes as she disappeared. 

Some men screamed. Rolfe braced a hand on the wheel. His first mate, 
that sea dragon sword freshly polished at his side, dropped to his knees. 

Lysandra dove, and she let them see the long, powerful body that broke 
the surface bit by bit as she plunged down, her jade scales gleaming like 


jewels in the blinding midday sun. See the legend straight from their 
prophecies: the Mycenians would only return when the sea dragons did. 

And so Aelin had ensured that one appeared right in their gods-damned 
harbor. 

"Holy gods," Fenrys muttered from where he rowed. 

Indeed, that was about the only reaction Aelin could muster as the sea 
dragon dove down deep, then swam ahead. 

For those were mighty fins--wings that Lysandra spread beneath the 
water, tucking in her small front arms and back legs, her massive, spiked 
tail acting as a rudder. 

Some of Rolfe's men were murmuring, "A dragon--a dragon to defend 
our own ship ... The legends of our fathers..." Indeed, Rolfe's face was 
pale as he stared toward where Lysandra had vanished into the blue, still 
clutching the wheel as if it'd keep him from falling. 

Two sea-wyverns ... against one sea dragon. 

For all the fire in the world would not work beneath the sea. And if they 
were to stand a chance of decimating those ships, there could be no 
interference from beneath the surface. 

"Come on, Lysandra," Aelin breathed, and sent a prayer to Temis, the 
Goddess of Wild Things, to keep the shifter swift and unfaltering beneath 
the waves. 


Aedion chucked off the shield from his back and slammed into the seat 
before the giant iron harpoon, its length perhaps a hand taller than him, its 
head bigger than his own. There were only three spears. He'd have to make 
his shots count. 

Across the bay, he could just make out the king taking up a position 
along the battlement on the lowest level of the tower. 

In the bay itself, Rolfe's ship rowed closer and closer to Ship-Breaker's 
lowered chain. 

Aedion stomped on one of the three operating pedals that allowed him 
to pivot the mounted launcher, gripping the handles on either side that 
positioned the spear into place. Carefully, precisely, he aimed the harpoon 


toward the very outer edge of the bay, where the two branches of the island 
leaned toward each other to provide a narrow passage into the harbor. 

Waves broke just beyond--a reef. Good for breaking ships against--and 
no doubt where Rolfe would plant his ship, in order to fool Morath's fleet 
into skewering themselves on it. 

"What the hell is that?" one of the sentries manning the gunner 
breathed, pointing toward the bay waters. 

A mighty, long shadow swept under the water ahead of the Sea Dragon, 
faster than the ship, faster than a dolphin. Its long, serpentine body soared 
through the sea, carried on wings that might have also been fins. 

Aedion's heart stopped dead. "It's a sea dragon," he managed to say. 

Well, at least he now knew what secret form Lysandra had been 
working on. 

And why Aelin had insisted on getting inside Brannon's temple. Not 
just to see the king, not just to reclaim the city for the Mycenians and 
Terrasen, but ... for Lysandra to study the life-size, detailed carvings of 
those sea dragons. To become a living myth. 

The two of them ... Oh, those crafty, scheming devils. A queen of 
legends indeed. 

"How ... how..." The sentry turned toward the others, babbling among 
themselves. "It's gonna defend us?" 

Lysandra approached Ship-Breaker, still lowered under the surface, 
twirling and arcing, banking along rocks as if getting a feel for her new 
form. Getting a feel for it in whatever little time they had. "Yes," Aedion 
breathed as terror flooded his veins. "Yes, she is." 


The water was warm, and quiet, and ageless. 

And she was a scaled shadow that set the jewel-colored fish darting into 
their coral homes; she was a soaring menace through the water that made 
the white birds bobbing on the surface scatter into flight as they sensed her 
passing below. 

Sunbeams streamed in pillars through the water, and Lysandra, in the 
small part of her that remained human, felt as if she were gliding through a 
temple of light and shadow. 


But there--far out, carried on echoes of sound and vibration--she felt 
them. 

Even the larger predators of these waters flitted off, taking to the open 
seas beyond the islands. Not even the promise of water stained red could 
keep them in the path of the two forces about to collide. 

Ahead, the mighty links of Ship-Breaker sagged into the deep, like the 
colossal necklace of some goddess leaning down to drink the sea. 

She had been reading about them--the long-forgotten and long-dead sea 
dragons--at Aelin's behest. Because her friend had known that strong- 
arming Rolfe with the Mycenians would only get them so far, but if they 
were to wield the power of myth instead ... its people might rally around it. 
And with a home to finally offer them, among these islands and in 
Terrasen... 

Lysandra had studied the carvings of the sea dragons at the temple, once 
Aelin had burned away the dirt on them. Her magic had filled in gaps the 
carvings didn't show. Like the nostrils that picked apart each scent on the 
current, the ears that unraveled varying layers of sound. 

Lysandra swept for the reef just beyond the parted lips of the island. 
She'd have to retract the wings, but here ... here she would make her stand. 

Here she would have to unleash every wild instinct, yielding the part of 
her that felt and cared. 

These beasts, however they were made, were only that: beasts. Animals. 

They would not fight with morals and codes. They would fight to the 
death, and fight for survival. There would be no mercy, no compassion. 

She would have to fight as they did. She had done so before--had 
turned feral not just that day the glass castle had shattered, but the night 
she'd been captured and those men had tried to take Evangeline. This would 
be no different. 

Lysandra dug her bone-shredding, curved talons into the reef shelf to 
hold her position against the current's nudging, and peered into the silent 
blue stretching endlessly ahead. 

So she began her death vigil. 


Chapter 35


Perched on the rail of the Sea Dragon, gripping the rope ladder flowing 
from the looming mast, Aelin savored the cooling spindrift that sprayed her 
face as the ship plowed through the waves. Once the ship was clear of the 
others, Rowan had let his winds fill its sails, setting the Sea Dragon flying 
toward the mammoth chain. 

It was hard not to look back as they passed over the submerged chain ... 
and then Ship-Breaker began to rise from the water. 

Sealing them out of the bay--where Rolfe's other ships would wait 
safely behind the chain's line--to guard the town now silently watching 
them. 

If all went well, they would only need this boat, she'd told Rolfe. 

And if it went badly, then his ships wouldn't make a difference anyway. 

Tightly grasping the rope, Aelin leaned out, the vibrant blue and white 
below passing in a swift blur. Not too fast, she'd told Rowan. Don t waste 
your strength--you barely slept last night. 

He'd just leaned in to nip at her ear before sliding onto Gavriel's bench 
to concentrate. 

He was still there, his power letting the men cease their rowing and 
prepare for what swept toward them. Aelin again looked ahead--toward 
those black sails blotting the horizon. 

The Wyrdkey at her chest murmured in response. 

She could feel them--her magic could taste their corruption on the 
wind. No sign of Lysandra, but she was out there. 

The sun was blinding on the waves as Rowan's magic slowed, bringing 
them into a steady glide toward the two peaks of the island that curved 
toward each other. 

It was time. 


Aelin swung off the railing, boots thudding on the soaked wood of the 
deck. So many eyes turned to her, to the chains spread across the main deck. 

Rolfe stalked toward her, descending from the raised quarterdeck, where 
he'd been manning the wheel himself. 

She picked up a heavy iron chain, wondering who it'd previously held. 
Rowan rose to his feet in a steady, graceful movement. He reached her 
when Rolfe did. 

The captain demanded, "What now?" 

Aelin jerked her chin toward the ships near enough to make out figures 
crammed onto the various decks. Many, many figures. "We draw them in as 
close as we can. When you can see the whites of their eyes, you shout at 
us." 

Rowan added, "And then you lay anchor off the starboard side. Swing 
us around." 

"Why?" Rolfe asked as Rowan helped her fasten the manacle around 
her wrist. 

She balked at the iron, her magic twisting. Rowan gripped her chin 
between his thumb and forefinger, making her meet his unflinching gaze, 
even as he said to Rolfe, "Because we don't want the masts in the way 
when we open fire. They seem like a rather important part of the ship." 

Rolfe growled and stalked off. 

Rowan's fingers slid to cup her jaw, his thumb brushing her cheek. "We 
draw out our power, slow and steady." 

"T know." 

He angled his head, brows lifting. A half smile curved his sinful mouth. 
"You've been spiraling down into your power for days now, haven't you?" 

She nodded. It had taken most of her focus, had been such an effort to 
stay in the present, to stay active and aware while she was burrowing down 
and down, drawing up as much of her power as she could without attracting 
any notice. "I didn't want to take any chances here. Not if you were drained 
from saving Dorian." 

"T've recovered, P11 have you know. So this morning's little display..." 

"A way to take off the power's full edge," she said wryly. "And make 
Rolfe piss himself." He chuckled and released her face to pass her the other 
manacle. She hated its ancient, hideous touch on her skin, on his, as she 
clamped it around his tattooed wrist. 


"Hurry," Rolfe said from where he'd returned to his spot at the wheel. 

Indeed, the ships were gaining on them. No sign of those sea-wyverns-- 
though the shifter also remained out of sight. 

Rowan palmed his hunting knife, the steel bright in the blazing sun. 
High noon. 

Precisely why she'd gone into Rolfe's office nearly two hours 
beforehand. 

She'd practically rung the dinner bell for the host in the Dead End. 
She'd gambled that they wouldn't wait until nightfall, but they apparently 
feared the wrath of their master if she slipped their nets more than they 
feared the light itself. Or were too stupid to realize Mala's heir would be at 
her most powerful. 

"Do you want to do the honors, or should I?" Rowan said. Fenrys and 
Gavriel had risen to their feet, blades out as they monitored from a safe 
distance. Aelin held out her free hand, her palm scarred, and took the knife 
from him. A quick slice had her skin stinging, warm blood heating her 
seawater-sticky skin. 

Rowan had the knife a heartbeat later, and the scent of his blood filled 
her nose, set her senses on edge. But she extended her bloodied palm. 

Her magic swirled into the world with it, crackling in her veins, her 
ears. She reined in the urge to tap her foot on the ground, to roll her 
shoulders. 

"Slow," Rowan repeated, as if sensing the hair-trigger that her power 
was now on, "and steady." His shackled arm slid around her waist to hold 
her to him. "Ill be with you every step of the way." 

She lifted her head to study his face, the harsh planes and the curving 
tattoo. He leaned in to brush a kiss to her mouth. And as his lips met hers, 
he joined their bleeding palms. 

Magic jolted through her, ancient and wicked and cunning, and she 
arched against him, knees buckling as his cataclysmic power roared into 
her. 

All anyone on deck saw, she knew, was two lovers embracing. 

But Aelin tunneled down, down, down into her power, felt him doing 
the same with his, felt every ounce of ice and wind and lightning go 
slamming from him into her. And when it reached her, the core of his power 


yielded to her own, melted and became embers and wildfire. Became the 
molten heart of the earth, shaping the world and birthing new lands. 

Deeper and deeper, she went. 

Aelin had a vague sense of the ship rocking beneath them, felt the faint 
bite of the iron as it rejected her magic, felt the presence of Fenrys and 
Gavriel flickering around them like candles. 

It had been months since she'd drawn from so deep in the abyss of her 
power. 

During the time she'd trained with Rowan in Wendlyn, her power's 
limit had been self-imposed. And then that day with the Valg, she'd broken 
through it--had discovered an entire hidden level beneath. She had drawn 
from it when she'd encircled Doranelle with her power, had taken a whole 
day to tunnel that far, to draw up what she needed. 

Aelin had begun this descent three days ago. 

She'd expected it to stop after the first day. To hit that bottom she'd 
sensed once before. 

She had not. 

And now ... now with Rowan's power joining hers... 

Rowan's arm still held her tightly against him, and she had the distant, 
murky sensation of his coat scratching lightly against her face, of the 
hardness of the weapons strapped beneath, the scent of him washing over 
her, soothing her. 

She was a stone plunked into the sea of her power--their power. 

Down 

and 

down 

and 

down 

There--there was the bottom. The ash-lined bottom, the pit of a 
dormant crater. 

Only the feeling of her own feet against the wood deck kept her from 
sinking into that ash, learning what might slumber beneath it. 

Her magic whispered to start digging through that ash and silt. But 
Rowan's grip tightened on her waist. "Easy," he murmured in her ear. 
"Easy." 


Still more of his power flowed into her, wind and ice churning with her 
power, eddying into a maelstrom. 

"Close now," Rolfe warned from nearby--from another world. 

"Aim for the middle of the fleet,' Rowan ordered her. "Send the 
flanking ships scattering onto the reef." Where they'd founder, leaving any 
survivors to be picked off with arrows shot by Fenrys and Rolfe's men. 
Rowan had to be alert, then--watching the approaching force. 

She could feel them--feel her magic's hackles rise in response to the 
blackness gathering beyond the horizon of her consciousness. 

"Almost in range," Rolfe called. 

She began pulling up, dragging the abyss of flame and embers with her. 

"Steady," Rowan murmured. 

Higher, higher, Aelin rose, back toward the sea and sunlight. 

Here, that sunlight seemed to beckon. To me. 

Her magic surged for it, for that voice. 

"Now!" Rolfe barked. 

And like a feral beast freed of its leash, her magic erupted. 


She'd been doing well as Rowan had handed over his power to her. 

She'd balked and bobbed a few times, but ... she had the descent under 
control. 

Even if her power ... the well had gone deeper than before. It was easy 
to forget she was still growing--that her power would mature with her. 

And when Rolfe shouted, Now! Rowan knew he had forgotten to his 
detriment. 

A pillar of flame that did not burn erupted from Aelin, slamming into 
the sky, turning the world into red and orange and gold. 

Aelin was ripped from his arms with the force of it, and Rowan grabbed 
her hand in a crushing grip, refusing to let her break that line of contact. 
Men around them stumbled back, falling onto their asses as they gawked 
upward in terror and wonder. 

Higher, that column of flame swirled, a maelstrom of death and life and 
rebirth. 

"Holy gods," Fenrys whispered behind him. 


Still Aelin's magic poured into the world. Still she burned hotter, wilder. 

Her teeth were gritted, her head arched back as she panted, eyes shut. 

"Aelin," Rowan warned. The pillar of flame began expanding, laced 
now with blue and turquoise. Flame that could melt bone, crack the earth. 

Too much. He had given her too much, and she had delved too deep into 
her power-- 

Through the flames encasing them, Rowan glimpsed the frantic enemy 
fleet, now hurling themselves into motion to flee, to get out of range. 

Aelin's ongoing display was not for them. 

Because there was no escape, not with the power she'd dragged up with 
her. 

The display was for the others, for the city watching them. 

For the world to know she was no mere princess playing with pretty 
embers. 

"Aelin," Rowan said again, trying to tug on that bond between them. 

But there was nothing. 

Only the gaping maw of some immortal, ancient beast. A beast that had 
opened an eye, a beast that spoke in the tongue of a thousand worlds. 

Ice flooded his veins. She was wearing the Wyrdkey. 

"Aelin." But Rowan felt it then. Felt that bottom of her power crack 
open as if the beast within that Wyrdkey stomped its foot, and ash and 
crusted rock crumbled away beneath it. 

And revealed a roiling, molten core of magic beneath it. 

As if it were the fiery heart of Mala herself. 

Aelin plunged into that power. Bathed in it. 

Rowan tried to move, tried to scream at her to stop-- 

But Rolfe, eyes wide with what could only be terror and awe, roared at 
her, "Open fire!' 

She heard that. And as violently as it had pierced the sky, that pillar of 
fire shot down, shot back into her, coiling and wrapping inside her, fusing 
into a kernel of power so hot it sizzled into him, searing his very soul-- 

The flames winked out at the same second she reached into Rowan with 
burning hands and fore the last remnants of his power from him. 

Just as she ripped her hand from his. Just as her power and the Wyrdkey 
between her breasts merged. 


Rowan collapsed to his knees, and there was a crack inside his head, as 
if thunder cleaved through him. 

As Aelin opened her eyes, he realized it wasn't thunder--but the sound 
of a door slamming open. 

Her face turned expressionless. Cold as the gaps between the stars. And 
her eyes... 

Turquoise burned bright ... around a core of silver. No hint of gold to be 
found. 

"That's not Aelin," Fenrys breathed. 

A faint smile blossomed on her full mouth, born of cruelty and 
arrogance, and she examined the iron chain wrapped around her wrist. 

The iron melted away, molten ore sizzling through the wooden deck and 
into the dark below. The creature that stared out through Aelin's eyes furled 
her fingers into a fist. Light leaked through her clenched fingers. 

Cold white light. Tendrils flickered--silver flame... 

"Get away," Gavriel warned him. "Get away and don t look." 

Gavriel was indeed on his knees, head bowed and eyes averted. Fenrys 
followed suit. 

For what gazed at the dark fleet assembled, what had filled his 
beloved's body ... He knew. Some primal, intrinsic part of him knew. 

"Deanna," Rowan whispered. She flicked her eyes to him in question 
and confirmation. 

And she said to him, in a voice that was deep and hollow, young and 
old, "Every key has a lock. Tell the Queen Who Was Promised to retrieve it 
soon, for all the allies in the world shall make no difference if she does not 
wield the Lock, if she does not put those keys back with it. Tell her flame 
and iron, together bound, merge into silver to learn what must be found. A 
mere step is all it shall take." Then she looked away again. 

And Rowan realized what the power in her hand was. Realized that the 
flame she would unleash would be so cold it burned, realized it was the cold 
of the stars, the cold of stolen light. 

Not wildfire--but moonfire. 





One moment she was there. And then she was not. 


And then she was shoved aside, locked into a box with no key, and the 
power was not hers, her body was not hers, her name was not hers. 

And she could feel the Other there, filling her, laughing silently as she 
marveled at the heat of the sun on her face, at the damp sea breeze coating 
her lips with salt, at the pain of the hand now healed of its wound. 

So long--it had been so long since the Other had felt such things, felt 
them wholly and not as something in between and diluted. 

And those flames--/er flames and her beloved's magic ... they 
belonged to the Other now. 

To a goddess who had walked through the temporary gate hanging 
between her breasts and seized her body as if it were a mask to wear. 

She had no words, for she had no voice, no self, nothing-- 

And she could only watch as if through a window as she felt the 
goddess, who had perhaps not protected her but hunted her the entirety of 
her life, for this moment, this opportunity, examine the dark fleet ahead. 

So easy to destroy it. 

But more life glimmered--behind. More life to obliterate, to hear their 
dying cries with her own ears, to witness firsthand what it was to cease to 
be in a way the goddess never could... 

She watched as her own hand, wreathed in pulsing white flame, began 
to move from where it had been aimed toward the dark fleet. 

Toward the unprotected city at the heart of the bay. 

Time slowed and stretched as her body pivoted toward that town, as her 
own arm lifted, her fist aimed toward the heart of it. There were people on 
the docks, the scions of a lost clan, some running from the display of fire 
she'd unleashed moments ago. Her fingers began to unfurl. 

"No!" 

The word was a roar, a plea, and silver and green flashed in her vision. 

A name. A name clanged through her as he hurled himself in the path of 
that fist, that moonfire, not just to save those innocents in the city, but to 
spare her soul from the agony if she destroyed them all-- 

Rowan. And as his face became clear, his tattoo stark in the sun, as that 
fist full of unimaginable power now opened toward his heart-- 

There was no force in any world that could keep her contained. 

And Aelin Galathynius remembered her own name as she shattered 
through the cage that goddess had shoved her into, as she grabbed that 


goddess by the damned throat and hurled her out, out, out through that 
gaping hole where she had infiltrated her, and sealed it-- 

Aelin snapped into her body, her power. 

Fire like ice, fire stolen from the stars-- 

Rowan's hair was still moving as he slammed into a stop before her 
uncoiling fist. 

Time launched again, full and fast and unrelenting. Aelin had only 
enough of it to throw herself sideways, to angle that now-open fist away 
from him, point it anywhere but at him-- 

The ship beneath her, the center and left flank of the dark fleet beyond 
her, and the outer edge of the island behind it blew apart in a storm of fire 
and ice. 


Chapter 36


There was such quiet beneath the waves, even as the muffled sounds of 
shouting, of collision, of death echoed toward her. 

Aelin drifted down, as she had drifted into her power, the weight of the 
Wyrdkey around her neck like a millstone-- 

Deanna. She didn't know how, didn't know why-- 

The Queen Who Was Promised. 

Her lungs constricted and burned. 

Shock. Perhaps this was shock. 

Down she drifted, trying to feel her way back into her body, her mind. 

Salt water stung her eyes. 

A large, strong hand gripped the back of her collar and yanked, hauling 
her up in tugs--in steady strokes. 

What had she done what had she done what had she done-- 

Light and air shattered around her, and that hand grasping her collar 
now banded around her chest, tugging her against a hard male body, 
keeping her head above the roiling waves. 

"Tve got you," said a voice that was not Rowan's. 

Others. There had been others on the ship, and she had as good as killed 
them all-- 

"Majesty," the male said, a question and quiet order. 

Fenrys. That was his name. 

She blinked, and her name, her title, her gutted power came thrashing 
back into her--the sea and the battle and the threat of Morath swarming. 

Later. Later, she'd deal with that rutting goddess who had thought to use 
her like some temple priestess. Later, she'd contemplate how she'd shred 
through every world to find Deanna and make her pay. 

"Hold on," Fenrys said over the chaos now filtering in: the screaming of 
men, the groaning of breaking things, the crackle of flames. "Don't let go." 


Before she could remember how to speak, they vanished into--nothing. 
Into darkness that was both solid and insubstantial as it squeezed her tightly. 

Then they were in the water again, bobbing beneath the waves as she 
reoriented herself and sputtered for air. He'd moved them, somehow-- 
jumped between distances, judging by the wholly different flotsam spinning 
around them. 

Fenrys held her against him, his panting labored. As if whatever magic 
he possessed to leap between short distances took everything he had. He 
sucked in a deep breath. 

Then they were gone again, into that dark, hollow, yet squeezing space. 
Only a handful of heartbeats passed before the water and sky returned. 

Fenrys grunted, arm tightening around her as he swam with the other 
toward the shore, shoving aside debris. His breathing was a wet rasp now. 
Whatever that magic was, it was spent. 

But Rowan--where was Rowan-- 

She made a sound that might have been his name, might have been a 
sob. 

Fenrys panted, "He's on the reef--he's fine." 

She didn't believe him. Thrashing against the Fae warrior's arm until he 
released her, she slid into the cold open water and twisted toward where 
Fenrys had been headed. Another small sound cracked from her as she 
beheld Rowan standing knee-deep in water atop the reef. His arm was 
already outstretched, even though thirty yards still separated them. 

Fine. Unscathed. Alive. And an equally soaked Gavriel stood beside 
him, facing-- 

Oh, gods, oh, gods. 

Blood stained the water. There were bodies everywhere. And Morath's 
fleet... 

Most of it was gone. Nothing more than black wood splintered across 
the archipelago and burning bits of canvas and rope. But three ships 
remained. 

Three ships now converging on the ruins of the Sea Dragon as it took 
on water, looming like thunderclouds-- 

"You have to swim," Fenrys growled beside her, his sodden golden hair 
plastered to his head. "Right now. As fast as you can." 

She whipped her head toward him, blinking away burning seawater. 


"Swim now," Fenrys snapped, canines flashing, and she didn't let 
herself consider what was prowling beneath them as he grabbed her collar 
again and practically threw her ahead of him. 

Aelin didn't wait. She focused on Rowan's outstretched hand as she 
swam, his face so carefully calm--the commander on a battlefield. Her 
magic was barren, her magic was a wasteland, and his ... She had stolen his 
power from him-- 

Think of that later. Aelin shoved through and ducked under larger bits 
of debris, past... 

Past men. Rolfe's men. Dead in the water. Was the captain among them 
somewhere? 

She'd likely killed her first and only human ally in this war--and her 
only direct path to that Lock. And if news of the former spread-- 

"Faster!" Fenrys barked. 

Rowan sheathed his sword, his knees bent-- 

Then he was swimming to her, fast and smooth, cutting between and 
beneath the waves, the water seeming to part for him. She wanted to growl 
she could make it herself, but-- 

He reached her, saying nothing before he slipped behind her. Guarding 
with Fenrys. 

And what could he do in the water with no magic, against a gaping maw 
of a sea-wyvern? 

She ignored the crushing tightness in her chest and hurtled for the reef, 
Gavriel now waiting where Rowan had been. Beneath her, the shelf of the 
coral at last spread, and she nearly sobbed, her muscles trembling as 
Gavriel crouched so she could reach his outstretched hand. 

The Lion easily hauled her out of the water. Her knees buckled as her 
boots steadied on the uneven coral heads, but Gavriel kept his grip on her, 
subtly letting her lean against him. Rowan and Fenrys were out a heartbeat 
later, and the prince instantly was there, hands on her face, slicking back her 
soaked hair, scanning her eyes. 

"I'm fine," she rasped, her voice hoarse. From the magic or the goddess 
or the salt water she'd swallowed. "I'm me." 

That was good enough for Rowan, who faced the three ships now 
bearing down on them. 


On her other side, Fenrys had doubled over, hands on his knees as he 
panted. He lifted his head at her gaze, hair dripping, but said to Rowan, 
"I'm out--we'll have to either wait for it to replenish or swim to shore." 

Rowan gave him a sharp nod that Aelin interpreted as understanding 
and thanks, and she glanced behind them. The reef seemed to be an 
extension of the black rocky shore far behind, but with the tide out, they'd 
indeed have to swim in spots. Have to risk what was beneath the water... 

Beneath the water. With Lysandra. 

There was no sign of wyvern or dragon. 

Aelin didn't know if that was a good or bad thing. 


Aelin and the Fae males had made it to the reef and now stood knee-deep in 
water atop it. 

Whatever had happened ... it had gone horribly wrong. So wrong that 
Lysandra could have sworn the feral, wild presence who had never once 
forgotten her had ducked into her long shadow as the world above 
exploded. 

She'd tumbled off the coral, the current cleaving and eddying. Wood 
and rope and canvas rained onto the surface, some plunging deep. Then 
bodies and arms and legs. 

But--there were the captain and his first mate thrashing against the 
flotsam that tangled them, trying to drag them down to the sandy floor. 

Shaking off her shock, Lysandra swept for them both. 

Rolfe and his man froze at her approach, reaching for weapons at their 
sides beneath the waves. But she ripped away the debris surely drowning 
them, then let herself go still--let them grab on to her. She didn't have 
much time... 

Rolfe and his first mate latched on to her legs, clinging like barnacles as 
she propelled them through the water--past the now-scorched ruin. The 
work of a minute had her depositing them onto a rocky shelf, and she 
emerged only long enough to gulp down a breath before diving. 

There were more men struggling in the water. She aimed for them, 
dodging debris, until-- 


Blood laced the current. And not the puffs that had been staining the 
water since the ship exploded. 

Great, roiling clouds of blood. As if massive jaws clamped around a 
body and squeezed. 

Lysandra launched forward, mighty tail snapping back and forth, body 
undulating, racing for the three boats bearing down on the survivors. She 
had to act now, while the wyverns were distracted with glutting themselves. 

The stench of the black boat reached her even under the waves. As if the 
dark wood had been soaked in rotted blood. 

And as she approached the closest ship's fat underbelly, two mighty 
shapes took form out in the blue. 

Lysandra felt their attention lock on her the moment she slammed her 
tail into the hull. 

Once. Twice. 

Wood cracked. Muffled shouts reached her from above. 

She drifted back, coiling, and slammed her tail into the hull a third time. 

Wood tore and ripped into her, peeling away scales, but the damage was 
done. Water sucked in past her, more and more, tearing through the wood as 
its death-wound grew and grew. She backtracked out of the water's pull-- 
flipping down, down, down as the two wyverns feasting on frantic men 
paused. 

Lysandra raced for the next ship. Get the ships sinking, then their allies 
could pick off the struggling soldiers one by one as they swam to shore. 

The second ship was wiser. 

Spears and arrows whizzed through the water, lancing for her. She dove 
to the sandy floor, then shot up, up, up, aiming for the vulnerable belly of 
the ship, body bracing for impact-- 

She didn't reach the ship before another impact came. 

Faster than she could sense, slipping around the side of the ship, the sea- 
wyvern slammed into her. 

Talons tore and sliced, and she flipped on instinct, whipping her tail so 
hard that the wyvern went tumbling out into the water. 

Lysandra lunged back, getting an eyeful of it as it stared her down. 

Oh, gods. 

It was nearly double her size, made of the deepest blue, its underside 
white and speckled with paler blue. The body was almost serpentine, wings 


little more than fins along its sides. Built not for speed or cruising through 
oceans, but ... but for the long, curving talons, for the maw that was now 
open, tasting the blood and salt and scent of her, revealing teeth as narrow 
and sharp as an eel's. 

Hooked teeth. For clamping down and shredding. 

Behind the wyvern, the other fell into formation. 

Men were splashing and screaming above her. If she did not get those 
enemy ships down... 

Lysandra tucked her wings in tight. She wished she had taken a bigger 
gulp of air, had filled these lungs to capacity. Fanning her tail in the current, 
she let the blood still leaking from where the ship's wood had pierced her 
hide drift to them. 

She knew the moment it reached the wyverns. 

The moment they realized she was not just an ordinary animal. 

And then Lysandra dove. 

Fast and smooth, she plunged into the deep. If they had been bred for 
brute killing, then she'd use speed. 

Lysandra swept beneath them, passing under their dark shadows before 
they could so much as pivot. Toward the open ocean. 

Come on, come on, come on-- 

Like hounds after a hare, they gave chase. 

There was a sandbar flanked by reefs just to the north. 

She aimed for it, swimming like hell. 

One of the wyverns was faster than the other, swift enough that its 
snapping maw rippled the water at her tail-- 

The water became clearer, brighter. Lysandra shot straight for the reef 
looming up out of the deep, a pillar of life and activity gone still. She 
curved around the sandbar-- 

The other wyvern appeared in front of her, the second still close on her 
tail. 

Clever things. 

But Lysandra threw herself to the side--into the shallows of the 
sandbar, and let momentum flip her, over and over, closer and closer to that 
narrow spit of sand. She dug her claws in deep, slowing to a stop, sand 
spraying and crusting her, and had her tail lifted, her body so much heavier 
out of the water-- 


The wyvern that had thought to catch her off guard by swimming 
around the other way launched itself out of the water and onto the sandbar. 

She struck, fast as an asp. 

Its neck exposed, she clamped her jaws around it and bit down. 

It bucked, tail slashing, but she slammed her own onto its spine. 
Cracking its back as she cracked its neck. 

Black blood that tasted of rancid meat flooded her throat. 

Dropping the dead wyvern, she scanned the turquoise seas, the flotsam, 
the two remaining ships and harbor-- 

Where was the second wyvern? Where the hell was it? 

Clever enough, she realized, to know when death was upon it and to 
seek an easier quarry. 

For that was a spiked dorsal fin now submerging. Heading toward... 

Toward where Aelin, Rowan, Gavriel, and Fenrys stood atop the reef, 
swords out. Surrounded by water on all sides. 

Lysandra plunged into the waves, sand and blood washing away. One 
more--just one more wyvern, then she could wreck the boats... 

The remaining wyvern reached the coral outcropping, gathering speed, 
as if it'd leap from the water and swallow the queen down whole. 

It didn't get within twenty feet of the surface. 

Lysandra hurled into it, both of them hitting the coral so hard it 
shuddered beneath them. But her claws were in its spine, her mouth around 
the back of its neck, shaking, yielding wholly to the song of survival, to the 
screaming demands of this body to kill, kill, kill-- 

They tumbled into open water, the wyvern still fighting, her grip on its 
neck loosening-- 

No. A warship loomed overhead, and Lysandra dug down deep, rallying 
her strength one last time as she spread those wings and flapped up-- 

She slammed the sea-wyvern into the hull of the boat now above them. 
The beast roared its fury. She slammed it again, and again. The hull 
snapped. And so did the sea-wyvern's body. 

She watched the beast go limp. Watched the water rush into the cleaved 
belly of the ship. Listened to the soldiers aboard begin shouting. 

She eased her claws from the beast and let it drift to the bottom of the 
sea. 

One more ship. Just one more... 


She was so tired. Shifting afterward might not even be possible for a 
few hours. 

Lysandra broke the surface, drawing down air, bracing herself. 

Aelin's screaming hit her before she could submerge again. 

Not in pain ... but warning. One word, over and over. One word for her. 

Swim. 

Lysandra craned her head toward where the queen stood atop the reef. 
But Aelin was pointing behind Lysandra. Not at the remaining ship ... but 
the open water. 

Where three massive forms raged through the waves, aiming right for 
her. 


Chapter 37


Aedion's queen was on the reef, Rowan beside her, his father and Fenrys 
flanking them. Rolfe and most of his men had made it to the opposite side 
of the narrow bay mouth--atop the reef there. 

And through the channel between them... 

One warship. 

One sea dragon. 

And three sea-wyverns. 

Adult sea-wyverns. The first two ... they hadn't been full-grown. 

"Oh, shit," the sentry beside Aedion on the watchtower began chanting. 
"Oh, shit. Oh, shit. Oh, shit." 

The sea-wyverns that, Rolfe had claimed, would go to the ends of the 
earth to slaughter whoever killed their offspring. Only being in the heart of 
the continent might save you--but even then, waterways would never be 
safe. 

And Lysandra had just killed two. 

It seemed they had not come alone. And from the cheering of the Valg 
soldiers on that remaining warship ... it had been a trap. The offspring had 
been the bait. 

They had been only slightly bigger than Lysandra. The adults--the bulls 
--were thrice her size. 

Longer than the warship now sitting there, archers firing at the men 
trying to swim ashore in the channel that had become a death trap for the 
green sea dragon. 

The green sea dragon who now stood between the three monstrous 
creatures and his queen, stranded on those rocks with not even an ember of 
magic left in her veins. His queen, screaming over and over and over at 
Lysandra to swim, to shift, to run. 

But Aedion had seen Lysandra take on the two offspring. 


By the second, she'd been lagging. And he'd seen her change shapes so 
often these past months to know she couldn't shift fast enough now, perhaps 
might not have enough strength left to do it at all. 

She was stranded in her form, as surely as his companions were stuck 
on the reef. And if Lysandra even tried to climb onto shore ... He knew the 
bulls would reach her before she could so much as haul her body out of the 
shallows. 

Faster and faster, those three bulls closed in. Lysandra remained at the 
mouth of the bay. 

Holding the line. 

Aedion's heart stopped. 

"She's dead," one of the sentries hissed. "Oh, gods, she's dead--" 

"Shut your rutting mouth," Aedion snarled, scanning the bay, slipping 
into that cold, calculating place that allowed him to make decisions in 
battle, to weigh the costs and risks. 

Dorian, however, got the idea before he did. 

Across the bay, hand uplifted and flickering bright as a star, Dorian 
signaled Lysandra again and again with his power. Come to me, come to me, 
come to me, the king seemed to call. 

The three bulls sank beneath the waves. 

Lysandra turned, plunging down-- 

But not toward Dorian. 

Aelin stopped shouting. And Dorian's magic winked out. 

Aedion could only watch as the shape-shifter's shadow soared toward 
the three bulls, meeting them head-on. 

The three wyverns spread out, so huge Aedion's throat went dry. 

And for the first time, he hated his cousin. 

He hated Aelin for asking this of Lysandra, both to defend them and to 
secure the Mycenians to fight for Terrasen. Hated the people who had left 
such scars on the shifter that Lysandra was so willing to throw her life 
away. Hated ... hated himself for being stuck in this useless tower, with a 
war machine only capable of firing one shot at a time. 

Lysandra aimed for the wyvern in the middle, and when only a hundred 
yards separated them, she veered left. 

They broke formation, one diving low, one keeping to the surface, and 
the other falling back. They were going to herd her. Herd her to a spot 


where they'd surround her from every angle and then rip her to shreds. It 
would be messy and vicious. 

But Lysandra shot across the channel. Headed-- 

Headed right for the final remaining warship. 

Arrows rained down on her. 

Blood bloomed as some found their mark through her jade scales. 

She kept swimming, her blood sending the bull closest to her, the one 
near the surface, into a frenzy, pushing himself faster to grab her, bite her-- 

Lysandra neared the ship, taking arrow after arrow, and leaped out of the 
water. 

She crashed into soldiers and wood and the mast, rolling, writhing, and 
bucking, the twin masts snapping under her tail. 

She hit the other side, flipping down into the water, red blood shining 
everywhere-- 

Just as the wyvern on her ass leaped onto the ship in a mighty arc that 
took Aedion's breath away. But with the jagged stumps of the masts jutting 
up like lances... 

The bull landed atop them with a crunch that Aedion heard across the 
bay. 

He bucked, but--that was wood now piercing through his back. 

And beneath his enormous weight ... the ship began to crack and sink. 

Lysandra wasted no time in getting clear, and Aedion could barely draw 
breath as she shot across the bay again, the two bulls so horribly close that 
their wakes merged. 

One dove, the depths swallowing him from sight. But the second one, 
still on her tail... 

Lysandra led that one right into Dorian's range. 

She drew in as close to the shore and looming tower as she could get, 
bringing the second bull with her. The king stretched out both hands. 

The bull raged past--only to halt as ice lashed across the water. Solid 
ice, such as there had never been here. 

The sentries beside Aedion fell silent. The bull roared, trying to wrest 
himself free--but the king's ice grew thicker, trapping the wyvern within its 
frozen grip. When the beast stopped moving, hoarfrost like scales covered 
him from snout to tail. 

Dorian loosed a battle cry. 


And Aedion had to admit the king wasn't that useless after all as the 
catapult behind Dorian sprang free, and a rock the size of a wagon 
jettisoned into the bay. 

Right atop the frozen wyvern. 

Rock met ice and flesh. And the wyvern shattered into a thousand 
pieces. 

Rolfe and some of his men were cheering--people were cheering from 
the docks in town. 

But there was one bull left in the harbor. And Lysandra was... 

She had no idea where the bull was. 

The long green body thrashed in the water, dipping beneath the waves, 
near-frantic. 

Aedion scanned the bay, rotating in the gunner chair as he did, 
searching for any hint of that colossal dark shadow-- 

"YOUR LEFT!" Gavriel roared across the bay, magic no doubt 
amplifying his voice. 

Lysandra twisted--and there the bull was, speeding out of the depths, as 
if he were a shark ambushing prey. 

Lysandra threw herself into movement. A field of floating debris lay 
around her, the sinking ships of their enemy like islands of death, and there 
was the chain ... If she could maybe get on it and climb high ... No, she 
was too heavy, too slow. 

She again streaked past Dorian's tower, but the bull wouldn't get near. 
He knew doom awaited him there. He kept just out of range, playing with 
her as she launched back into the field of debris between the enemy ships. 
Toward the open sea. 

Aelin and the others watched helplessly from the reef outcropping as the 
two monsters swept by, the bull sending bits of broken hulls and masts into 
the air--aiming at the shifter. 

One struck Lysandra in the side, and she went down. 

Aedion shot out of his seat, a roar on his lips. But there she was, blood 
streaming from her as she swam and swam, as she led that bull through the 
heart of debris, then cut back--sharply. The bull followed through the blood 
clouding the water, blasting through debris that she nimbly dodged. 

She'd worked him into a blood-frenzy. 


And Lysandra, damn her, led him to the remnants of enemy ships, 
where Valg soldiers were trying to save themselves. The bull exploded 
through soldier and wood as if they were veils of gossamer. 

Leaping through the water, twining around debris and coral and bodies, 
the sunlight glinting on green scales and ruby blood, Lysandra led the bull 
into a dance of death. 

Each movement slower as more of her blood leaked into the water. 

And then she changed course. Heading into the bay. To the chain. 

And cut north--toward him. 

Aedion examined the massive bolt before him. 

Three hundred yards of open water separated her from the range of his 
arrow. 

"SWIM," Aedion roared, even if she couldn't hear. "SWIM, 
LYSANDRA!" 

Silence fell across the entirety of Skull's Bay as that jade sea dragon 
swam for her life. 

The bull gained on her, diving down. 

Lysandra passed under the links of the chain, and the shadow of the bull 
spread beneath her. 

So small. She was so small compared to him--one bite was all it would 
take. 

Aedion slammed himself back into the gunner chair, gripping the levers 
and pivoting the machine as she swam and swam for him. 

One shot. That was all he'd have. One gods-damned shot. 

Lysandra hurled herself forward, and Aedion knew she was aware of the 
death that loomed. Knew she was pushing that sea dragon's heart to near- 
stopping. Knew that the bull had reached the bottom and now launched 
himself up, up, up toward her vulnerable belly. 

Only a few more yards, only a few more heartbeats. 

Sweat slid down Aedion's brow, his own heart hammering so violently 
all he could hear was its thunder. He shifted the spear, slightly, adjusting his 
aim. 

The bull raged up from the deep, maw open, ready to rip her in half with 
one blow. 

Lysandra passed into range and leaped--leaped clean out of the water, 
all sparkling scales and blood. The bull jumped with her, water streaming 


from his open jaws as they arced up. 

Aedion fired, slamming his palms into the lever. 

Lysandra's long body arched away from those jaws as the bull lifted 
clean out of the water, baring his white throat-- 

As Aedion's massive spear went clean through it. 

Blood spurted from the open jaws, and the creature's eyes went wide as 
he reared back. 

Lysandra slammed into the water, sending a plume so high it blocked 
out the sight of both of them as they crashed into the sea. 

When it subsided, there was only the shadow of them--and a growing 
pool of black blood. 

"You... you... ," the sentry babbled. 

"Load another one," he ordered, standing from his seat to scan the 
bubbling water. 

Where was she, where was she-- 

Aelin was perched on Rowan's shoulders, scanning the bay. 

And then a green head shot from the water, black blood spraying like 
spindrift as she hurled the severed head of the bull across the waves. 

Cheering--riotous, wild cheering--exploded from every corner of the 
bay. 

But Aedion was already up and running, half leaping down the stairs 
that would take him toward the beach that Lysandra now swam for, her own 
blood replacing the black ichor that stained the water. 

So slow, each of her movements was so painfully slow. He lost track of 
her as he descended below the tree line, his chest heaving. 

Roots and stones wrenched at him, but his Fae-swift feet flew over the 
loam until it turned to sand, until light broke through the trees and there she 
was, sprawled on the beach, bleeding everywhere. 

Beyond them, out in the bay, Ship-Breaker dropped low, and Rolfe's 
fleet swept out to pick off the surviving soldiers--and save any of their own 
still out there. 

He vaguely noted Aelin and the others diving into the sea, swimming 
hard for land. 

Aedion dropped to his knees, wincing as sand sprayed onto her. Her 
scaled head was nearly as big as he was, but her eyes ... those green eyes, 
the same color as her scales... 


Full of pain. And exhaustion. 

He lifted a hand toward her, but she showed her teeth--a low snarl 
slipping out of her. 

He held up his hands, scooting back. 

It was not the woman who looked at him, but the beast she'd become. 
As if she had given herself so fully to its instincts, that it had been the only 
way to survive. 

There were gashes and slices everywhere. All dribbling blood, soaking 
the white sand. 

Rowan and Aelin--one of them could help. If they could summon any 
power after what the queen had done. Lysandra closed her eyes, her 
breathing shallow. 

"Open your gods-damned eyes," Aedion snarled. 

She snarled back but cracked open an eye. 

"You made it this far. Don't die on the rutting beach." 

The eye narrowed--with a hint of female temper. He had to get the 
woman back. Let her take control. Or else the beast would never allow them 
near enough to help. 

"You can thank me when your sorry ass is healed." 

Again, that eye watched him warily, temper flickering. But an animal 
remained. 

Aedion drawled, even as his relief began to crumble his mask of 
arrogant calmness, "The useless sentries in the watchtower are now all half 
in love with you," he lied. "One said he wanted to marry you." 

A low snarl. He yielded a foot but held eye contact with her as he 
grinned. "But you know what I told them? I said that they didn't stand a 
chance in hell." Aedion lowered his voice, holding her pained, exhausted 
stare. "Because / am going to marry you," he promised her. "One day. I am 
going to marry you. I'll be generous and let you pick when, even if it's ten 
years from now. Or twenty. But one day, you are going to be my wife." 

Those eyes narrowed--in what he could only call female outrage and 
exasperation. 

He shrugged. "Princess Lysandra Ashryver sounds nice, doesn't it?" 

And then the dragon huffed. In amusement. Exhaustion, but ... 
amusement. 


She opened her jaws, as if she'd try to speak, but realized she couldn't 
in this body. Blood leaked through her enormous teeth, and she shuddered 
in pain. 

Brush snapped and crashed, and there were Aelin and Rowan, and his 
father and Fenrys. All of them soaked, covered in sand, and gray as death. 

His queen staggered for Lysandra with a sob, flinging herself onto the 
sand before Aedion could bark a warning. 

But Lysandra only winced as the queen laid a hand on her, saying over 
and over, "I'm so sorry, I'm so sorry." 

Fenrys and Gavriel, who had maybe saved her life with that amplified 
shout about the bull's location, lingered near the tree line as Rowan 
approached, surveying the wounds. 

Fenrys spotted Aedion's glance, spotted the warning wrath on his face if 
either of them got near the shifter, and said, "That was one hell of a shot, 
boyo." His father nodded in silent agreement. 

Aedion ignored them both. Whatever well of magic his cousin and 
Rowan had depleted was already refilling. The shifter's wounds knitted 
closed, one by one. Slowly--painfully slowly, but ... the bleeding stopped. 

"She lost a lot of blood," Rowan observed to none of them in particular. 
"Too much." 

"Tve never seen anything like that in my life," Fenrys murmured. None 
of them had. 

Aelin was trembling, a hand on her friend--face so white and drawn 
that any harsh words he'd reserved for her were unnecessary. His queen 
knew the cost. It had taken her so damn long to trust any of them to do 
anything. If Aedion roared at her now, even if he still yearned to ... Aelin 
might never delegate again. Because if Lysandra hadn't been in the water 
when things had gone so, so badly... 

"What happened?" he breathed, catching Aelin's eye. "What the hell 
happened out there?" 

"I lost control," Aelin said hoarsely. As if she couldn't help it, her hand 
drifted to her chest. Where, through the white of her shirt, he could make 
out the Amulet of Orynth. 

He knew then. Knew precisely what Aelin carried. What would have 
snagged Rolfe's interest on that map of his--similar enough to the Valg 
essence to get him to come running. 





Knew why it had been so important, so vital, she risk everything to get 
it from Arobynn Hamel. Knew that she had used a Wyrdkey today, and it 
had almost killed them all-- 

He was shaking now, that rage indeed taking over. But Rowan snarled at 
him, low and vicious, "Save it for later." Because Fenrys and Gavriel had 
tensed--watching. 

Aedion growled right back at him. Rowan gave him a cold, steady look 
that said if he so much as began to hint at what their queen carried, he'd rip 
out his tongue. Literally. 

Aedion shoved down the anger. "We can't carry her, and she's too weak 
to shift." 

"Then we wait here until she can," Aelin said. But her eyes drifted to 
the bay, where Rolfe was now being helped onto those rescue ships. And to 
the city beyond, still cheering. 

A victory--but very nearly a loss. The remnants of the Mycenians, 
saved by one of their long-lost sea dragons. Aelin and Lysandra had woven 
ancient prophecies into tangible fact. 

"PI stay," Aedion said. "You deal with Rolfe." 

His father offered from behind him, "I can get some supplies from the 
watchtower." 

"Fine," he said. 

Aelin groaned, getting to her feet, but stared down at him before she 
took Rowan's extended hand. She said softly, "I'm sorry." 

Aedion knew she meant it. He still didn't bother replying. 

Lysandra groaned, the reverberations running up his knees and straight 
into his gut, and Aedion whirled back to the shifter. 

Aelin left without further good-bye. 


The Lion lingered in the brush, keeping out of sight and sound as the Wolf 
watched over the dragon still sprawled across the beach. 

For hours, the Wolf remained there. While the outgoing tide cleared the 
harbor of blood. While the Pirate Lord's ships sent any remaining enemy 
bodies to the crushing blue. While the young queen returned to the city in 
the heart of the bay to handle any fallout. 


Once the sun had begun to set, the dragon stirred, and slowly, her form 
shimmering and shrinking, scales were smoothed into skin, a snout melted 
back into a flawless human face, and stumpy limbs lengthened into golden 
legs. Sand crusted her naked body, and she tried and failed to rise. The Wolf 
moved then, slinging his cloak around her and sweeping her into his arms. 

The shifter didn't object, and her eyes were again closed by the time the 
Wolf began striding up the beach to the trees, her head leaning against his 
chest. 

The Lion remained out of sight and held in the offer of help. Held in the 
words he needed to say to the Wolf, who had downed a sea-wyvern with 
one arrow. Twenty-four years old and already a myth whispered over 
campfires. 

Today's events would no doubt be told around fires in lands even the 
Lion had not roamed in all his centuries. 

The Lion watched the Wolf vanish into the trees, heading for the town at 
the end of the sandy road, the shifter unconscious in his arms. 

And the Lion wondered if he himself would ever be mentioned in those 
whispered stories--if his son would ever allow the world to know who had 
sired him. Or even care. 


Chapter 38 


The meeting with Rolfe once the harbor was again safe was quick. Frank. 

And Aelin knew if she didn't get the hell out of this city for an hour or 
two, she might very well explode again. 

Every key has a lock, Deanna had said, a little reminder of Brannon's 
order. Using her voice. And had called her that title ... that title that struck 
some chord of horror and understanding in her, so deep she was still 
working out what it meant. The Queen Who Was Promised. 

Aelin stormed onto a spit of beach on the far side of the island, having 
run here, needing to get her blood roaring, needing it to silence the thoughts 
in her head. Behind her, Rowan's steps were quiet as death. 

Only the two of them had been in that meeting with Rolfe. Bloodied, 
soaked, the Pirate Lord had met them in the main room of his inn, the name 
of it now a permanent reminder of the ship she'd wrecked. He demanded, 
"What the hell happened?" 

And she had been so tired, so pissed off and full of disgust and despair, 
that it had been nearly impossible to muster the swagger. "When you are 
blessed by Mala, you find that sometimes your control can slip." 

"Slip? I don't know what you fools were talking about down there, but 
from where I was standing, it looked like you lost your gods-damned mind 
and were about to fire on my town." 

Rowan, leaning against the edge of a nearby table, explained, "Magic is 
a living thing. When you are that deep in it, remembering yourself, your 
purpose, is an effort. That my queen did so before it was too late is a feat in 
itself." 

Rolfe wasn't impressed. "It looks to me like you were a little girl 
playing with power too big for you to handle, and only your prince jumping 
in your path made you decide not to slaughter my innocent people." 


Aelin closed her eyes for a heartbeat, the image of Rowan leaping in 
front of that fist of moonfire flashing before her. When she opened her eyes, 
she let the crackling assuredness fade into something frozen and hard. "It 
looks to me," she said, "like the Pirate Lord of Skull's Bay and long-lost 
Mycenian heir has just allied with a young queen so powerful she can 
decimate cities if she wishes. It looks to me like you have made yourself 
untouchable with that alliance, and any fool who seeks to harm you, usurp 
you, will have me to contend with. So I suggest you salvage what you can 
of your precious ship, mourn the dozen men I take full responsibility for 
losing and whose families I will compensate accordingly, and shut your 
rutting mouth." 

She turned toward the door, exhaustion and rage nipping at her bones. 

Rolfe said to her back, "Do you want to know what the cost of this map 
was?" 

She halted, Rowan glancing between them, face unreadable. 

She smirked over her shoulder. "Your soul?" 

Rolfe let out a hoarse laugh. "Yes--in a way. When I was sixteen, I was 
barely more than a slave on one of these festering ships, my Mycenian 
heritage just a one-way ticket to a beating." He laid a tattooed hand on the 
Thresher's lettering. "Every coin I earned came back here--to my mother 
and sister. And one day the ship I was on got caught in a storm. The captain 
was a haughty bastard, refused to find safe harbor, and the ship was 
destroyed. Most of the crew drowned. I drifted for a day, washed up on an 
island at the edge of the archipelago, and awoke to find a man staring down 
at me. I asked if I was dead, and he laughed and inquired what I wanted for 
myself. I was so delirious I told him that I wanted to be captain--I wanted 
to be Pirate Lord of Skull's Bay and make the arrogant fools like the captain 
who had killed my friends bow before me. I thought I was dreaming when 
he explained that if he were to grant me the skills to do it, there would be a 
price. What I valued most in the world, he would have. I said I'd pay it-- 
whatever it was. I had no belongings, no wealth, no people anyway. A few 
coppers would be nothing. He smiled before he vanished into sea mist. I 
awoke with the ink on my hands." 

Aelin waited. 

Rolfe shrugged. "I made it back here, finding friendly ships using the 
map the stranger had inked there. A gift from a god--or so I thought. But it 


wasn't until I saw the black sheets over my cottage's windows that I began 
to worry. And it wasn't until I learned that my mother and sister had used 
their little money to hire a skiff to go looking for me--and that the skiff had 
returned to harbor but they had not--that I realized the price I'd handed 
over. That's what the sea claimed. What he claimed. And it made me 
soulless enough that I loosed myself upon this city, this archipelago." 
Rolfe's green eyes were as merciless as the Sea God who had gifted and 
damned him. "That was the price of my power. What shall yours be, Aelin 
Galathynius?" 

She didn't reply to him before storming out. Though Deanna's voice 
had echoed in her mind. 

The Queen Who Was Promised. 

Now, standing on that empty beach and monitoring the glimmering 
expanse of the sea as the last of the sun vanished, Rowan said beside her, 
"Did you willingly use the key?" 

No hint of judgment, of condemnation. Just curiosity--and concern. 

Aelin rasped, "No. I don't know what happened. One minute it was us 
... then she came." She rubbed at her chest, avoiding the touch of the 
golden chain against it. Her throat tightened as she took in that spot on his 
own chest, right between his pectorals. Where her fist had been aimed. 

"How could you?" she breathed, a tremor running through her. "How 
could you put yourself in front of me like that?" 

Rowan took a step closer but no farther. The crashing of waves and 
cries of gulls heading home for the night filled the space between them. "If 
you had destroyed that city, it would have destroyed you, and any sort of 
hope at an alliance." 

Shaking began in her hands, spreading to her arms, her chest, her knees. 
Flame and ash curled on her tongue. "If I had killed you," she hissed, but 
choked on the words, unable to finish the thought, the idea of it. Her throat 
burned, and she squeezed her eyes shut, warm flames rippling around her. 
"I thought I'd found the bottom of my power," she admitted, magic already 
overflowing, so soon, too soon after she'd emptied herself. "I thought what 
I found in Wendlyn was the bottom. I had no idea it was all just an ... 
antechamber." 

Aelin lifted her hands, opening her eyes to find her fingers wreathed in 
flame. Darkness spread over the world. Through the veil of gold and blue 


and red, she looked at her prince. She raised her burning hands helplessly 
between them. "She stole me--she took me. And I could feel her--feel her 
consciousness. It was like she was a spider, waiting in a web for decades, 
knowing I'd one day be strong and stupid enough to use my magic and the 
key together. I might as well have rung the dinner bell." Her fire burned 
hotter, brighter, and she let it build and rise and flicker. 

A wry, bitter smile. "It seems she wants us to make finding this Lock a 
priority, if you were given the message twice." 

Indeed. "Isn't it enough to contend with Erawan and Maeve, to do the 
bidding of Brannon and Elena? Now I have to face the gods breathing down 
my neck about it as well?" 

"Perhaps it was a warning--perhaps Deanna wished to show you how a 
not-so-friendly god might use you if you're not careful." 

"She enjoyed every rutting second of it. She wanted to see what my 
power might do, what she could do with my body, with the key." Her 
flames burned hotter, shredding through her clothes until they were ash, 
until she was naked and clothed in only her own fire. "And what she called 
me--the Queen Who Was Promised. Promised when? To whom? To do 
what? I've never heard that phrase in my life, not even before Terrasen 
fell." 

"We'll figure it out." And that was that. 

"How can you be so ... fine with this?" Embers sprayed from her like a 
swarm of fireflies. 

Rowan's mouth tightened. "Trust me, Aelin, I am anything but fine with 
the idea that you are fair game to those immortal bastards. I am anything 
but fine with the idea that you could be taken from me like that. If I could, I 
would hunt Deanna down and pay her back for it." 

"She's the Goddess of the Hunt. You might be at a disadvantage." Her 
flames eased a bit. 

A half smile. "She's a haughty immortal. She's bound to slip up. And 
besides ... " A shrug. "I have her sister on my side." He angled his head, 
studying her fire, her face. "Perhaps that's why Mala appeared to me that 
morning, why she gave me her blessing." 

"Because you're the only one arrogant and insane enough to hunt a 
goddess?" 


Rowan shucked off his boots, tossing them onto the dry sand behind 
him. "Because I'm the only one arrogant and insane enough to ask Mala 
Fire-Bringer to let me stay with the woman I love." 

Her flames turned to pure gold at the words--at that word. But she said, 
"Perhaps you're just the only one arrogant and insane enough to love me." 

That unreadable mask cracked. "This new depth to your power, Aelin, 
changes nothing. What Deanna did changes nothing. You are still young; 
your power is still growing. And if this new well of power gives us even the 
slightest advantage against Erawan, then thank the rutting darkness for it. 
But you and I will learn to manage your power together. You do not face 
this alone; you do not decide that you are unlovable because you have 
powers that can save and destroy. If you start to resent that power..." He 
shook his head. "I do not think we will win this war if you start down that 
road." 

Aelin strode into the lapping waves and sank to her knees in the surf, 
steam rising around her in great plumes. "Sometimes," she admitted over 
the hissing water, "I wish someone else could fight this war." 

Rowan stepped into the bubbling surf, his magic shielding against the 
heat of her. "Ah," he said, kneeling beside her as she still gazed out over the 
dark sea, "but who else would be able to get under Erawan's skin? Never 
underestimate the power of that insufferable swagger." 

She chuckled, starting to feel the cool kiss of the water on her naked 
body. "As far as memory serves, Prince, it was that insufferable swagger 
that won your cranky, immortal heart." 

Rowan leaned into the thin veil of flame now melting into night-sweet 
air and nipped her lower lip. A sharp, wicked bite. ""There's my Fireheart." 

Aelin let him pivot her in the surf and sand to face him fully, let him 
slide his mouth along her jaw, the curve of her cheekbone, the point of her 
Fae ear."These," he said, nibbling at her earlobe, "have been tempting me 
for months." His tongue traced the delicate tip, and her back arched. The 
strong hands at her hips tightened. "Sometimes, you'd be sleeping beside 
me at Mistward, and it'd take all my concentration not to lean over and bite 
them. Bite you all over." 

"Hmmm," she said, tipping back her head to grant him access to her 
neck. 


Rowan obliged her silent demand, pressing kisses and soft, growling 
nips to her throat. "I've never taken a woman on a beach," he purred against 
her skin, sucking gently on the space between her neck and shoulder. "And 
look at that--we're far from any sort of ... collateral." One hand drifted 
from her hip to caress the scars on her back, the other sliding to cup her 
backside, drawing her fully against him. 

Aelin spread her hands over his chest, tugging his white shirt over his 
head. Warm waves crashed against them, but Rowan held her fast-- 
unmovable, unshakable. 

Aelin remembered herself enough to say, "Someone might come 
looking for us." 

Rowan huffed a laugh against her neck. "Something tells me," he said, 
his breath skittering along her skin, "you might not mind if we were 
discovered. If someone saw how thoroughly I plan to worship you." 

She felt the words dangling there, felt herself dangling there, off the 
edge of the cliff. She swallowed. But Rowan had caught her each time she 
had fallen--first, when she had plummeted into that abyss of despair and 
grief; second, when that castle had shattered and she had plunged to the 
earth. And now this time, this third time ... She was not afraid. 

Aelin met Rowan's stare and said clearly and baldly and without a 
speckle of doubt, "I love you. I am in love with you, Rowan. I have been 
for a while. And I know there are limits to what you can give me, and I 
know you might need time--" 

His lips crushed into hers, and he said onto her mouth, dropping words 
more precious than rubies and emeralds and sapphires into her heart, her 
soul, "I love you. There is no limit to what I can give to you, no time I need. 
Even when this world is a forgotten whisper of dust between the stars, I will 
love you." 

Aelin didn't know when she started crying, when her body began 
shaking with the force of it. She had never said such words--to anyone. 
Never let herself be that vulnerable, never felt this burning and unending 
thing, so consuming she might die from the force of it. 

Rowan pulled back, wiping away her tears with his thumbs, one after 
another. He said softly, barely audible over the crashing waves around 
them, '"Fireheart." 

She sniffed back tears. "Buzzard." 


He roared a laugh and she let him lay her down on the sand with a 
gentleness near reverence. His sculpted chest heaved slightly as he ran an 
eye over her bare body. "You ... are so beautiful." 

She knew he didn't just mean the skin and curves and bones. 

But Aelin still smiled, humming. "I know," she said, lifting her arms 
above her head, setting the Amulet of Orynth onto a safe, high part of the 
beach. Her fingers dug into the soft sand as she arched her back in a slow 
stretch. 

Rowan tracked every movement, every flicker of muscle and skin. 
When his gaze lingered on her breasts, gleaming with seawater, his 
expression turned ravenous. 

Then his gaze slid lower. Lower. And when it lingered on the apex of 
her thighs and his eyes glazed, Aelin said to him, "Are you going to stand 
there gawking all night?" 

Rowan's mouth parted slightly, his breathing shallow, his body already 
showing her precisely where this was going to end. 

A phantom wind hissed through the palms, whispered over the sand. 
Her magic tingled as she felt, more than saw, Rowan's shield fall into place 
around them. She sent her own power tracing over it, knocking and tapping 
at the shield in sparks of flame. 

Rowan's canines gleamed. "Nothing is getting past that shield. And 
nothing is going to hurt me, either." 

Something tight in her chest eased. "Is it that different? With someone 
like me." 

"I don't know," Rowan admitted. Again, his eyes slid along her body, as 
if he could see through skin to her burning heart beneath. "I've never been 
with ... an equal. I've never allowed myself to be that unleashed." 

For every bit of power she threw at him, he'd throw back at her. She 
braced herself on her elbows, lifting her mouth to the new scar on his 
shoulder, the wound small and jagged--as broad as an arrowhead. She 
kissed it once, twice. 

Rowan's body was so tense above hers she thought his muscles would 
snap. But his hands were gentle as they drifted to her back, stroking her 
scars and the tattoos he'd inked over them. 

The waves tickled and caressed her, and he made to settle over her, but 
she lifted a hand to his chest--halting him dead. She smiled against his 


mouth. "If we're equals, then I don't understand why you're still half 
clothed." 

She didn't give him the chance to explain as she traced her tongue over 
the seam of his lips, as her fingers unlatched the buckle of his worn sword 
belt. She wasn't sure he was breathing. 

And just to see what he'd do, she palmed him through his pants. 

Rowan barked a curse. 

She laughed quietly, kissed his newest scar again, and dragged a finger 
down lazily, indolently, holding his gaze for every single inch she touched. 

And when Aelin laid her palm flat on him again, she said, "You are 
mine." 

Rowan's breathing started again, jagged and savage as the waves 
breaking around them. She flicked open the top button of his pants. "I'm 
yours," he ground out. 

Another button popped free. "And you love me," she said. Not a 
question. 

"To whatever end," he breathed. 

She popped the third and final button free, and he let go of her to toss 
his pants into the sand nearby, taking his undershorts with them. Her mouth 
went dry as she took in the sight of him. 

Rowan had been bred and honed for battle, and every inch of him was 
pure-blooded warrior. 

He was the most beautiful thing she'd ever seen. Hers--he was hers, 
and 





"You are mine," Rowan breathed, and she felt the claiming in her bones, 
her soul. 

"I am yours," she answered. 

"And you love me." Such hope and quiet joy in his eyes, beneath all 
that fierceness. 

"To whatever end." For too long--for too long had he been alone and 
wandering. No longer. 

Rowan kissed her again. Slow. Soft. A hand slid up the plane of her 
torso while he lowered himself over her, his hips nestling against hers. She 
gasped a bit at the touch, gasped a bit more as his knuckle grazed the heavy, 
aching underside of her breast. As he leaned down to kiss the other. 


His teeth grazed over her nipple, and her eyes drifted closed, a moan 
slipping out of her. 

Oh, gods. Oh, burning, rutting gods. Rowan knew what he was doing; 
he really gods-damned did. 

His tongue flicked against her nipple, and her head tipped back, her 
fingers digging into his shoulders, urging him to take more, take harder. 

Rowan growled his approval, her breast still in his mouth, on his 
tongue, his hand making lazy strokes from her ribs down her waist, down 
her thighs, then back up. She arched in silent demand-- 

A phantom touch, like the northern wind given form, flicked over her 
bare breast. 

Aelin burst into flames. 

Rowan laughed darkly at the reds and golds and blues that erupted 
around them, illumining the palms that towered over the edge of the beach, 
the waves breaking behind him. She might have panicked, might have been 
mortified, had he not lifted his mouth to hers, had those phantom hands of 
ice-kissed wind not kept working her breasts, had his own hand not 
continued stroking, closer and closer to where she needed him. "You're 
magnificent," he murmured onto her lips, his tongue sliding into her mouth. 

The hardness of him pushed against her, and she bucked her hips, 
needing to grind herself against him, to do anything to ease the building 
ache between her legs. Rowan groaned, and she wondered if there was any 
other male in the world who would be so naked and prone with a woman on 
fire, who would not look at those flames with any ounce of fear. 

She slid her hand between them, and when she closed her fingers 
around him, marveling at the velvet-wrapped steel, Rowan groaned again, 
pushing into her hand. She pulled her mouth from his, staring into those 
pine-green eyes as she slid her hand along him. He lowered his head--not 
to kiss her, but to watch where she stroked him. 

A roaring wind full of ice and snow blasted around them. And it was her 
turn to huff a laugh. But Rowan gripped her wrist, drawing her hand away. 
She opened her mouth in protest, wanting to touch more, taste more. "Let 
me," Rowan growled onto the sea-slick skin between her breasts. "Let me 
touch you." His voice trembled enough that Aelin lifted his chin with her 
thumb and forefinger. 


A flicker of fear and relief shone beneath the glazed lust. As if doing 
this, touching her, was as much to remind him that she had made it today, 
that she was safe, as it was to pleasure her. She leaned up, brushing her 
mouth against his. "Do your worst, Prince." 

Rowan's smile was nothing short of wicked as he pulled away to run a 
broad hand from her throat down to the juncture of her thighs. She 
shuddered at the sheer possession in the touch, her breath coming in tight 
pants as he gripped either thigh and spread her legs, baring her fully for 
him. 

Another wave crashed, parting around them, the cool water like a 
thousand kisses along her skin. Rowan kissed her navel, then her hip. 

Aelin couldn't take her eyes from his silver hair shining with salt water 
and moonlight, from the hands holding her wide for him as his head dipped 
between her legs. 

And as Rowan tasted her on that beach, as he laughed against her slick 
skin while her hoarse cries of his name shattered across palm trees and sand 
and water, Aelin let go of all pretense at reason. 

She moved, hips undulating, begging him to go, go, go. So Rowan did, 
sliding a finger into her as his tongue flicked that one spot, and oh, gods, 
she was going to explode into starfire-- 

"Aelin," he growled, her name a plea. 

"Please," she moaned. "Please." 

The word was his undoing. Rowan rose over her again, and she let out a 
sound that might have been a whimper, might have been his name. 

Then Rowan had a hand braced in the sand beside her head, fingers 
twining in her hair, while the other guided himself into her. At the first 
nudge of him, she forgot her own name. And as he slid in with gentle, 
rolling thrusts, filling her inch by inch, she forgot that she was queen and 
that she had a separate body and a kingdom and a world to look after. 

When Rowan was seated deep in her, trembling with restraint as he let 
her adjust, she lifted her burning hands to his face, wind and ice tumbling 
and roaring around them, dancing across the waves with ribbons of flame. 
There were no words in his eyes; none in hers, either. 

Words did not do it justice. Not in any language, in any world. 

He leaned in, claiming her mouth as he began to move, and they let go 
entirely. 


She might have been crying, or it might have been his tears on her face, 
turning to steam amid her flames. 

She dragged her hands down his powerful, muscled back, over scars 
from battles and terrors long since past. And as his thrusts turned deeper, 
she dug in her fingers, dragging her nails across his back, claiming him, 
marking him. His hips slammed home at the blood she drew, and she 
arched, baring her throat to him. For him--only him. 

Rowan's magic went wild, though his mouth on her neck was so 
careful, even as his canines dragged along her skin. And at the touch of 
those lethal teeth against her, the death that hovered nearby and the hands 
that would always be gentle with her, always love her-- 

Release blasted through her like wildfire. And though she could not 
remember her name, she remembered Rowan's as she cried it while he kept 
moving, wringing every last ounce of pleasure from her, fire searing the 
sand around them to glass. 

Rowan's own release barreled through him at the sight of it, and he 
groaned her name so that she remembered it at last, lightning joining wind 
and ice over the water. 

Aelin held him through it, sending the fire-opal of her magic to twine 
with his power. On and on, as he spilled himself in her, lightning and flame 
danced on the sea. 

The lightning continued to strike, silent and lovely, even after he stilled. 
The sounds of the world came pouring back in, his breathing as ragged as 
the hiss of the crashing waves while he brushed lazy kisses to her temple, 
her nose, her mouth. Aelin drew her eyes away from the beauty of their 
magic, the beauty of them, and found his face to be the most beautiful of all. 

She was trembling--and so was Rowan as he remained in her. He 
buried his face in the crook of her neck and shoulder, his uneven breath 
warming her skin. "I never ... ," he tried, voice hoarse. "I didn't know it 
could be..." 

She ran her fingers down his scarred back, over and over. "I know," she 
breathed. "I know." 

Already, she wanted more, already she was calculating how long she'd 
have to wait. "You once told me that you don't bite the females of other 
males." Rowan stiffened a bit. But she went on coyly, "Does that mean ... 
you'll bite your own female, then?" 


Understanding flashed in those green eyes as he raised his head from 
her neck to study the spot where those canines had once pierced her skin. 
"That was the first time I really lost control around you, you know. I wanted 
to chuck you off a cliff, yet I bit you before I knew what I was doing. I 
think my body knew, my magic knew. And you tasted..." Rowan loosed a 
jagged breath. "So good. I hated you for it. I couldn't stop thinking about it. 
Pd wake up at night with that taste on my tongue--wake up thinking about 
your foul, beautiful mouth." He traced his thumb over her lips. "You don't 
want to know the depraved things I've thought about this mouth." 

"Hmmm, likewise, but you didn't answer my question," Aelin said, 
even as her toes curled in the wet sand and warm water. 

"Yes," Rowan said thickly. "Some males enjoy doing it. To mark 
territory, for pleasure..." 

"Do females bite males?" 

He began to harden again inside her as the question lingered. Oh, gods 
--Fae lovers. Everyone should be so damn lucky to have one. Rowan 
rasped, "Do you want to bite me?" 

Aelin eyed his throat, his glorious body, and the face she had once so 
fiercely hated. And she wondered if it were possible to love someone 
enough to die from it. If it were possible to love someone enough that time 
and distance and death were of no concern. "Am I limited to your neck?" 

Rowan's eyes flared, and his answering thrust was answer enough. 

They moved together, undulating like the sea before them, and when 
Rowan roared her name again into the star-flecked black, Aelin hoped the 
gods themselves heard it and knew their days were now numbered. 


Chapter 39


Rowan didn't know whether to be amused, thrilled, or slightly terrified that 
he'd been blessed with a queen and lover who had so little care for public 
decency. He'd taken her three times on that beach--twice in the sand, then 
a third out in the warm waters. And yet his very blood was still electrified. 
And yet he still wanted more. 

They'd swum into the shallows to wash off the sand crusted on them, 
but Aelin had wrapped her legs around his waist, kissed his neck, then 
licked his ear the way he'd nibbled hers, and he was buried in her again. 
She knew why he needed the contact, why he'd needed to taste her on his 
tongue, and then with the rest of his body. She'd needed the same. 

He still needed it. When they'd finished after that first time, he'd been 
left reeling, to pull his sanity back together after the joining that had ... 
unleashed him. Broken and remade him. His magic had been a song, and 
she had been... 

He'd never had anything like her. Everything he'd given her, she'd 
given right back to him. And when she had bit him during that second 
coupling in the sand ... His magic had left six nearby palm trees in splinters 
as he'd climaxed hard enough that he thought his body would shatter. 

But once they were finished, when she'd actually made to walk back to 
Skull's Bay in nothing but her flames, he'd given her his shirt and belt. 
Which did little to cover her up, especially those beautiful legs, but at least 
it was less likely to start a riot. 

Barely, though. And it'd be obvious what they'd done on that beach the 
moment they stepped within scenting range of anyone with a preternatural 
sense of smell. 

He'd marked her--tricher than the scent that had clung to her before. 
Marked her deep and true, and there was no undoing it, no washing it away. 
She'd claimed him, and he'd claimed her, and he knew she was well aware 


of what that claiming meant--just as he knew ... He knew it had been a 
choice on her part. A final decision regarding the matter of who would be in 
her royal bed. 

He would try to live up to that honor--try to find some way to prove he 
deserved it. That she hadn't bet on the wrong horse. Somehow. He'd earn it. 
Even with so little to offer beyond his own magic and heart. 

But he also knew his queen. And knew that despite the enormity of 
what they'd done, Aelin had also kept him on that beach to avoid the others. 
Avoid answering their questions and demands. But he made it one foot 
inside the Ocean Rose, saw the light in Aedion's room, and knew their 
friends would not be so easily deterred. 

Indeed, Aelin was scowling up at the light--though worry quickly 
replaced it as she remembered the shifter who had been so thoroughly 
unconscious. Her bare feet were silent on the stairs and hallway as she 
hurried for the room, not bothering to knock before flinging open the door. 

Rowan loosed a sharp breath, trying to draw up his magic to cool the 
fire still in his blood. To calm the instincts roaring and raging at him. Not to 
take her--but to eliminate any other threat. 

A dangerous time, for any Fae male, when they first took a lover. 
Worse, when it meant something more. 

Dorian and Aedion sat in the two armchairs before the darkened 
fireplace, arms crossed. 

And her cousin's face went pale with what might have been terror as he 
scented Aelin--the markings both seen and invisible on them. 

Lysandra sat in bed, face drawn but eyes narrowed at the queen. It was 
the shifter who purred, "Enjoy your ride?" 

Aedion didn't dare move and was giving Dorian a warning look to do 
the same. Rowan bit down against the rage at the sight of other males near 
his queen, reminding himself that they were his friends, but-- 

That primal rage stumbled as he felt Aelin's shuddering relief upon 
finding the shifter mostly healed and lucid. But his queen only shrugged. 
"Isn't that all these Fae males are good for?" 

Rowan raised his brows, chuckling as he debated reminding her how 
she'd begged him throughout, how she'd said words like please, and oh, 
gods, and then a few extra pleases thrown in for good measure. He'd enjoy 
wringing those rarely seen manners from her again. 


Aelin shot him a glare, daring him to say it. And despite just having her, 
despite the fact that he could still taste her, Rowan knew that whenever they 
found their bed again, she would not get the rest she wanted. Color stained 
Aelin's cheeks, as if she saw his plans unfold, but she lifted the amulet from 
around her neck, dropped it onto the low-lying table between Aedion and 
Dorian, and said, "I learned that this was the third Wyrdkey when I was still 
in Wendlyn." 

Silence. 

Then, as if she hadn't shattered any sense of safety they still possessed, 
Aelin withdrew the mangled Eye of Elena from her pack, chucked it once in 
the air, and jerked her chin at the King of Adarlan. "I think it's time you met 
your ancestor." 


Dorian listened to Aelin's story. 

About the Wyrdkey she'd secretly carried, about what had happened 
today in the bay, about how she'd tricked Lorcan and how it would 
eventually lead the warrior back to them--hopefully with the other two 
keys in his hands. And, if they were lucky, they would have already found 
this Lock she had been ordered twice now to retrieve from the Stone 
Marshes--the only thing capable of binding the Wyrdkeys back into the 
gate from which they'd been hewn and ending the threat of Erawan forever. 

No number of allies would make a difference if they could not stop 
Erawan from using those keys to unleash the Valg hordes from his own 
realm upon Erilea. His possession of two keys had already led to such 
darkness. If he gained the third, gained mastery over the Wyrdgate and 
could open it to any world at will, use it to summon any conquering army 
... They had to find that Lock to nullify those keys. 

When the queen was done, Aedion was silently fuming, Lysandra was 
frowning, and Aelin was now snuffing out the candles in the room with 
hardly a wave of her hand. Two ancient tomes, withdrawn from Aedion's 
crammed saddlebags, lay open on the table. He knew those books--he had 
no idea she'd taken them from Rifthold. The warped metal of the Eye of 
Elena amulet sat atop one of them as Aelin double-checked the markings on 
an age-spotted page. 


Darkness fell as she used her own blood to etch those markings on the 
wooden floor. 

"Looks like our bill of damages to this city is going to rise," Lysandra 
muttered. 

Aelin snorted. "We'll just move the rug to cover it." She finished 
making a mark--a Wyrdmark, Dorian realized with a chill, and stepped 
back, plucking up the Eye in her fist. 

"Now what?" Aedion said. 

"Now we keep our mouths shut," Aelin said sweetly. 

The moonlight spread on the floor, devoured by the dark lines she'd 
etched. Aelin drifted over to where Rowan sat on the edge of the bed, still 
shirtless thanks to the queen currently wearing his shirt, and took up a spot 
beside him, a hand on his knee. 

Lysandra was the first to notice. 

She sat up in the bed, green eyes glowing with animal brightness as the 
moonlight on the blood-marks seemed to shimmer. Aelin and Rowan jerked 
to their feet. Dorian just stared at the marks, at the moonlight, at the beam 
of it shining through the open balcony doors. 

As if the light itself were a doorway, the shaft of moonlight turned into a 
humanoid figure. 

It flickered, its form barely there. Like a figment of a dream. 

The hair on Dorian's arms rose. And he had the good sense to slide out 
of his chair and onto a knee as he bowed his head. 

He was the only one who did so. The only one, he realized, who had 
spoken to Elena's mate, Gavin. Long ago--another lifetime ago. He tried 
not to consider what it meant that he now carried Gavin's sword, Damaris. 
Aelin had not asked for it back--did not seem inclined to do so. 

A muffled female voice, as if it were calling from far away, flickered in 
and out with the image. "Too--far," a light, young voice said. 

Aelin stepped forward and shut those ancient spellbooks before stacking 
them with a thump. "Well, Rifthold isn't exactly available, and your tomb is 
trashed, so tough luck." 

Dorian's head lifted as he glanced between the flickering figure of 
moonlight and the young queen of flesh and blood. 

Elena's roughly formed body vanished, then reappeared, as if the wind 
itself disturbed her. "Can't--hold--" 


"Then Ill make it quick." Aelin's voice was sharp as a blade. "No more 
games. No more half-truths. Why did Deanna arrive today? I get it: finding 
the Lock is important. But what is it? And tell me what she meant by 
calling me the Queen Who Was Promised." 

As if the words jolted the dead queen like lightning, his ancestor 
appeared, fully corporeal. 

She was exquisite: her face young and grave, her hair long and silvery- 
white--like Manon's--and her eyes ... Startling, dazzling blue. They now 
fixed on him, the pale gown she wore fluttering on a phantom breeze. 
"Rise, young king." 

Aelin snorted. "Can we not play the holier-than-thou-ancient-spirit 
game?" 

But Elena surveyed Rowan, Aedion. Her slender, fair neck bobbed. 

And Aelin, gods above, snapped her fingers at the queen--once, twice 
--drawing her attention back to her. "Hello, Elena," she drawled, "so nice 
to see you. It's been a while. Care to answer some questions?" 

Irritation flickered in the dead queen's eyes. But Elena's chin remained 
high, her slender shoulders back. "I do not have much time. The connection 
is too hard to maintain so far from Rifthold." 

"What a surprise." 

The two queens stared each other down. 

Elena, Wyrd damn him, broke first. "Deanna is a god. She does not have 
rules and morals and codes the way we do. Time does not exist for her the 
way it does for us. You let your magic touch the key, the key opened a door, 
and Deanna happened to be watching at that exact moment. That she spoke 
to you at all is a gift. That you managed to shove her out before she was 
ready ... She will not soon forget that insult, Majesty." 

"She can get in line," Aelin said. 

Elena shook her head. "There is ... there is so much I did not get to tell 
you." 

"Like the fact that you and Gavin never killed Erawan, lied to everyone 
about it, and then left him for us to deal with?" 

Dorian risked a glance at Aedion, but his face was hard, calculating, 
ever the general--fixed on the dead queen now standing in this room with 
them. Lysandra--Lysandra was gone. 


No, in ghost leopard form, slinking through the shadows. Rowan's hand 
was resting casually on his sword, though Dorian's own magic swept the 
room and realized the weapon was to be the physical distraction from the 
magical blow he'd deal Elena if she so much as looked funny at Aelin. 
Indeed, a hard shield of air now lay between the two queens--and sealed 
this room, too. 

Elena shook her head, her silver hair flowing. "You were meant to 
retrieve the Wyrdkeys before Erawan could get this far." 

"Well, I didn't," Aelin snapped. "Forgive me if you weren't entirely 
clear on your directions." 

Elena said, "I do not have time to explain, but know it was the only 
choice. To save us, to save Erilea, it was the only choice I could make." 
And for all their snapping at each other, the queen exposed her palms to 
Aelin. "Deanna and my father spoke true. I'd thought ... Pd thought it was 
broken, but if they told you to find the Lock ... " She bit her lip. 

Aelin said, "Brannon said to go to the Stone Marshes of Eyllwe to find 
the Lock. Where, precisely, in the marshes?" 

"There was once a great city in the heart of the marshes," Elena 
breathed. "It is now half drowned on the plain. In a temple at its center, we 
laid the remnants of the Lock. I didn't ... My father attained the Lock at 
terrible cost. The cost ... of my mother's body, her mortal life. A Lock for 
the Wyrdkeys--to seal shut the gate, and bind the keys inside them forever. 
I did not understand what it had been intended for; my father never told me 
about any of it until it was too late. All I knew was that the Lock was only 
able to be used once--its power capable of sealing anything we wished. So 
I stole it. I used it for myself, for my people. I have been paying for that 
crime since." 

"You used it to seal Erawan in his tomb," Aelin said quietly. 

The pleading faded from Elena's face. "My friends died in the valley of 
the Black Mountains that day so I might have the chance to stop him. I 
heard their screaming, even in the heart of Erawan's camp. I will not 
apologize for trying to end the slaughter so that the survivors could have a 
future. So you could have a future." 

"So you used the Lock, then chucked it into a ruin?" 

"We placed it inside the holy city on the plain--to be a commemoration 
of the lives lost. But a great cataclysm rocked the land decades later ... and 


the city sank, the marsh water flowed in, and the Lock was forgotten. No 
one ever retrieved it. Its power had already been used. It was just a bit of 
metal and glass." 

"And now it's not?" 

"If both my father and Deanna mentioned it, it must be vital in stopping 
Erawan." 

"Forgive me if I do not trust the word of a goddess who tried to use me 
like a puppet to blow this town into smithereens." 

"Her methods are roundabout, but she likely meant you no harm--" 

"Bullshit." 

Elena flickered again. "Get to the Stone Marshes. Find the Lock." 

"I told Brannon, and Pll tell you: we have more pressing matters at 
hand--" 

"My mother died to forge that Lock," Elena snapped, eyes blazing 
bright. "She let go of her mortal body so that she could forge the Lock for 
my father. I was the one who broke the promise for how it was to be used." 

Aelin blinked, and Dorian wondered if he should indeed be worried 
when even she was speechless. But Aelin only whispered, "Who was your 
mother?" 

Dorian ransacked his memory, all his history lessons on his royal house, 
but couldn't recall. 

Elena made a sound that might have been a sob, her image fading into 
cobwebs and moonlight. "She who loved my father best. She who blessed 
him with such mighty gifts, and then bound herself in a mortal body and 
offered him the gift of her heart." 

Aelin's arms slackened at her sides. 

Aedion blurted, "Shit." 

Elena laughed humorlessly as she said to Aelin, "Why do you think you 
burn so brightly? It is not just Brannon's blood that is in your veins. But 
Mala's." 

Aelin breathed, "Mala Fire-Bringer was your mother." 

Elena was already gone. 

Aedion said, "Honestly, it's a miracle you two didn't kill each other." 

Dorian didn't bother to correct him that it was technically impossible, 
given that one of them was already dead. Rather, he weighed all that the 
queen had said and demanded. Rowan, remaining silent, seemed to be 


doing the same. Lysandra sniffed around the blood-marks, as if testing for 
whatever remnants of the ancient queen might be around. 

Aelin stared out the open balcony doors, eyes hooded and mouth a tight 
line. She unfurled her fist and examined the Eye of Elena, still held in her 
palm. 

The clock struck one in the morning. Slowly, Aelin turned to them. To 
him. 

"Mala's blood flows in our veins," she said hoarsely, fingers closing 
around the Eye before she slipped it into the shirt's pocket. 

He blinked, realizing that it indeed did. That perhaps both of them had 
been so considerably gifted because of it. Dorian said to Rowan, if only 
because he might have heard or witnessed something in all his travels, "Is it 
truly possible--for a god to become mortal like that?" 

Rowan, who had been watching Aelin a bit warily, twisted to him. "I've 
never heard of such a thing. But ... Fae have given up their immortality to 
bind their lives to that of their mortal mates." Dorian had the distinct feeling 
Aelin was deliberately examining a spot on her shirt. "It's certainly possible 
Mala found a way to do it." 

"It's not just possible," Aelin murmured. "She did it. That ... pit of 
power I uncovered today ... That was from Mala herself. Elena might be 
many things, but she wasn't lying about that." 

Lysandra shifted back into her human form, swaying enough that she set 
herself down on the bed before Aedion could move to steady her. "So what 
do we do now?" she asked, her voice gravelly. ""Erawan's fleet squats in the 
Gulf of Oro; Maeve sails for Eyllwe. But neither knows that we possess this 
Wyrdkey--or that this Lock exists ... and lies directly between their 
forces." 

For a heartbeat, Dorian felt like a useless fool as they all, including him, 
looked to Aelin. He was King of Adarlan, he reminded himself. Equal to 
her. Even if his lands and people had been stolen, his capital captured. 

But Aelin rubbed her eyes with her thumb and forefinger, loosing a long 
breath. "I really, really hate that old windbag." She lifted her head, 
surveying them all, and said simply, "We sail for the Stone Marshes in the 
morning to hunt down that Lock." 

"Rolfe and the Mycenians?" Aedion asked. 


T 


"He takes half his fleet to find the rest of the Mycenians, wherever 
they're hiding. Then they all sail north to Terrasen." 

"Rifthold lies between here and there, with wyverns patrolling it," 
Aedion countered. "And this plan depends on if we can trust Rolfe to 
actually follow through on his promise." 

"Rolfe knows how to stay out of range," Rowan said. "We have little 
choice but to trust him. And he honored the promise he made to Aelin 
regarding the slaves two and a half years ago." No doubt why Aelin had 
made him confirm it so thoroughly. 

"And the other half of Rolfe's fleet?" Aedion pushed. 

"Some remain to hold the archipelago," Aelin said. "And some come 
with us to Eyllwe." 

"You can't fight Maeve's armada with a fraction of Rolfe's fleet," 
Aedion said, crossing his arms. Dorian bit back his own agreement, leaving 
the general to it. "Let alone Morath's forces." 

"I'm not going there to pick a fight," was all Aelin said. And that was 
that. 

They dispersed then, Aelin and Rowan slipping off to their own room. 

Dorian lay awake, even when his companions' breathing became deep 
and slow. He mulled over each word Elena had uttered, mulled over that 
long-ago appearance of Gavin, who had awoken him to stop Aelin from 
opening that portal. Perhaps Gavin had done it not to spare Aelin from 
damnation, but to keep those waiting, cold-eyed gods from seizing her as 
Deanna had today. 

He tucked the speculation away to consider when he was less prone to 
leaping to conclusions. But the threads lay in a lattice across his mind, in 
hues of red and green and gold and blue, glimmering and thrumming, 
whispering their secrets in languages not spoken in this world. 


An hour past dawn, they departed Skull's Bay on the swiftest ship Rolfe 
could spare. Rolfe didn't bother to say good-bye, already preoccupied with 
readying his fleet, before they sailed out of the sparkling harbor and into the 
lush archipelago beyond. He did grant Aelin one parting gift: vague 
coordinates for the Lock. His map had found it--or rather, the general 


location. Some sort of wards must be placed around it, the captain warned 
them, if his tattoo could not pinpoint its resting place. But it was better than 
nothing, Dorian supposed. Aelin had grumbled as much. 

Rowan circled high above in hawk form, scouting behind and ahead. 
Fenrys and Gavriel were at the oars, helping row them out of the harbor-- 
Aedion doing so as well, at a comfortable distance from his father.Dorian 
himself stood at the wheel beside the surly, short captain--an older woman 
who had no interest in speaking to him, king or not. Lysandra swam in the 
surf below in some form or another, guarding them from any threats 
beneath the surface. 

But Aelin stood alone on the prow, her golden hair unbound and 
flowing behind her, so still that she might have been the twin to the 
figurehead mere feet beneath. The rising sun cast her in shimmering gold, 
no hint of the moonfire that had threatened to destroy them all. 

But even as the queen stood undimming before the shadows of the 
world ... a lick of cold traced the contours of Dorian's heart. 

And he wondered if Aelin was somehow watching the archipelago, and 
the seas, and the skies, as if she might never see them again. 


Three days later, they were nearly out of the archipelago's strangling grasp. 
Dorian was again at the helm, Aelin at the prow, the others scattered on 
various rounds of scouting and resting. 

His magic felt it before he did. A sense of awareness, of warning and 
awakening. 

He scanned the horizon. The Fae warriors fell silent before the others. 

It looked like a cloud at first--a wind-tossed little cloud on the horizon. 
Then a large bird. 

When the sailors began rushing for their weapons, Dorian's mind at last 
spat out a name for the beast that swept toward them on shimmering, wide 
wings. Wyvern. 

There was only one. And only one rider atop it. A rider who did not 
move, whose white hair was unbound--listing toward the side. As the rider 
now was. 


The wyvern dropped lower, skimming over the water. Lysandra was 
instantly ready, waiting for the queen's order to shift into whatever form 
would fight it-- 

"No." The word ripped from Dorian's lips before he could think. But 
then it came out, over and over, as the wyvern and rider sailed closer to the 
ship. 

The witch was unconscious, her body leaning to the side because she 
was not awake, because that was blue blood all over her. Don t shoot; don t 
shoot-- 

Dorian was roaring the order as he hurtled for where Fenrys had drawn 
his longbow, a black-tipped arrow aimed at the witch's exposed neck. His 
words were swallowed by the shouting of the sailors and their captain. 
Dorian's magic swelled as he unsheathed Damaris-- 

But then Aelin's voice cut over the fray--Hold your fire! 

All of them halted. The wyvern sailed close, then banked, circling the 
boat. 

Blue blood crusted the beast's scarred sides. So much blood. The witch 
was barely in the saddle. Her tan face was leeched of color, her lips paler 
than whale bone. 

The wyvern completed its circle, sweeping lower this time, readying to 
land as near the boat as possible. Not to attack ... but for help. 

One moment, the wyvern was soaring smoothly over the cobalt waves. 
Then the witch listed so far that her body seemed to go boneless. As if in 
that heartbeat, when help was mere feet away, whatever luck had kept her 
astride at last abandoned her. 

Silence fell on the ship as Manon Blackbeak tumbled from her saddle, 
falling through wind and spindrift, and hit the water. 



Chapter 40


The smoke had been stinging Elide's eyes for the better part of the gray 
muggy morning. 

Just farmers burning fields left to fallow, Molly had claimed, so the 
ashes might fertilize the earth for next year's harvest. They had to be miles 
away, but the smoke and ash would travel far on the brisk northward wind. 
The wind that led home to Terrasen. 

But they weren't headed to Terrasen. They were headed due east, 
straight toward the coast. 

Soon she'd have to cut northward. They had passed through one town-- 
only one, and its denizens had already been fatigued of roving carnivals and 
performers. Even with the night barely under way, Elide already knew they 
would likely only make enough money to cover their expenses for staying. 

She had attracted a grand total of four customers to her little tent so far, 
mostly young men looking to know which of the village girls fancied them, 
barely noticing that Elide--beneath the makeup pasted thick as cream on 
her face--was no older than they were. They'd scampered off when their 
friends had rushed by, whispering through the star-painted flaps that a 
swordsman was putting on the show of a lifetime, and his arms were nearly 
the size of tree trunks. 

Elide had glowered, both at the feckless young men who vanished--one 
without paying--and at Lorcan, for stealing the show. 

She waited all of two minutes before shoving out of the tent, the 
enormous, ridiculous headdress Molly had plunked on her hair snagging on 
the flaps. Bits of dangling beads and charms hung from the arching crest, 
and Elide batted them out of her eyes, nearly tripping over her matching 
bloodred robes as she went to see what all the fuss was about. 

If the young men of the town had been impressed by Lorcan's muscles, 
it was nothing on what those muscles were doing to the young women. 


And older women, Elide realized, not bothering to squeeze through the 
tightly packed crowd before the makeshift stage on which Lorcan stood, 
juggling and throwing swords and knives. 

Lorcan was not a natural performer. No, he had the gall to actually look 
bored up there, bordering on outright sullen. 

But what he lacked in charm he made up for with his shirtless, oiled 
body. And holy gods... 

Lorcan made the young men who had visited her tent look like ... 
children. 

He balanced and hurled his weapons as if they were nothing, and she 
had the feeling the warrior was merely going through one of his daily 
exercise routines. But the crowd still oohed and aahed at every twist and 
toss and catch, and coins still trickled into the pan at the edge of the stage. 

With the torches around him, Lorcan's dark hair seemed to swallow the 
light, his onyx eyes flat and dull. Elide wondered if he was contemplating 
the murder of everyone drooling over him like dogs around a bone. She 
couldn't blame him. 

A trickle of sweat slid through the crisp spattering of dark hair on his 
sculpted chest. Elide watched, a bit transfixed, as that bead of sweat wended 
down the muscled grooves of his stomach. Lower. 

No better than those ogling women, she said to herself, about to head 
back into her tent when Molly observed from beside her, "Your husband 
could just be sitting up there, fixing your stockings, and women would 
empty their pockets for the chance to stare at him." 

"He had that effect wherever we went with our former carnival," Elide 
lied. 

Molly clicked her tongue. "You're lucky," she murmured as Lorcan 
hurled his sword high in the air and people gasped, "that he still looks at 
you the way he does." 

Elide wondered if Lorcan would look at her at all if she told him what 
her name was, who she was, what she carried. He'd slept on the floor of the 
tent each night--not that she'd ever once bothered to offer him the roll. He 
usually came in after she'd fallen asleep, and left before she awoke. To do 
what, she had no idea--perhaps exercise, since his body was ... like that. 

Lorcan chucked three knives in the air, bowing without one bit of 
humility or amusement to the crowd. They gasped again as the blades 


aimed for his exposed spine. 

But in an easy, beautiful maneuver, Lorcan rolled, catching each blade, 
one after another. 

The crowd cheered, and Lorcan coolly looked at his pan of coins. 

More copper--and some silver--flowed, like the patter of rain. 

Molly let out a low laugh. "Desire and fear can loosen any purse 
strings." A sharp glance. "Shouldn't you be in your tent?" 

Elide didn't bother responding as she left, and could have sworn she felt 
Lorcan's gaze narrow on her, on the headdress and swaying beads, on the 
long, voluminous robes. She kept going, and endured a few more young 
men--and some young women--asking about their love lives before she 
found herself again alone in that silly tent, the dark only illuminated by 
dangling crystal orbs with tiny candles inside. 

She was waiting for Molly to finally shout the carnival was over when 
Lorcan shouldered through the flaps, wiping his face with a scrap of fabric 
that was most definitely not his shirt. 

Elide said, "Molly will be begging you to stay, you realize." 

He slid into the folding chair before her round table. "Is that your 
professional prediction?" 

She swatted at a strand of beads that swayed into her eyes. "Did you sell 
your shirt, too?" 

Lorcan gave a feral grin. "Got ten coppers from a farmer's wife for it." 

Elide scowled. "That's disgusting." 

"Money is money. I suppose you don't need to worry about it, with all 
the gold you've got stashed." 

Elide held his stare, not bothering to look pleasant. "You're in a rare 
good mood." 

"Having two women and one man offer a spot in their beds tonight will 
do that to a person." 

"Then why are you here?" It came out sharper than she intended. 

He surveyed the hanging orbs, the woven carpet, the black tablecloth, 
and then her hands, scarred and calloused and small, gripping the edge of 
the table. "Wouldn't it ruin your ruse if I slipped off into the night with 
someone else? You'd be expected to throw me out on my ass--to be 
heartbroken and raging for the rest of your time here." 





"You might as well enjoy yourself," she said. "You're going to leave 
soon anyway." 

"So are you," he reminded her. 

Elide tapped a finger on the tablecloth, the rough fabric scratching 
against her skin. 

"What is it?" he demanded. As if it were an inconvenience to be polite. 

"Nothing." 

It wasn't nothing, though. She knew why she'd been delaying that turn 
northward, the inevitable departure from this group and final trek on her 
own. 

She could barely make an impact at a backwater carnival. What the hell 
would she do in a court of such powerful people--especially without being 
able to read? While Aelin could destroy kings and save cities, what the hell 
would she do to prove her worth? Wash their clothes? Clean their dishes? 

"Marion," he said roughly. 

She looked up, surprised to find him still there. Lorcan's dark eyes were 
unreadable in the dimness. "You had plenty of young men unable to stop 
staring at you tonight. Why not have some fun with them?" 

"Why?" she snapped. The thought of a stranger touching her, of some 
faceless, nameless man pawing at her in the dark... 

Lorcan stilled. He said too calmly, "When you were in Morath, did 
someone--"' 

"No." She knew what he meant. "No--it didn't get that far." But the 
memory of those men touching her, laughing at her nakedness ... She 
shoved it away. "I've never been with a man. Never had the chance or the 
interest." 

He cocked his head, his dark, silken hair sliding over his face. "Do you 
prefer women?" 

She blinked at him. "No--I don't think so. I don't know what I prefer. 
Again, I've never ... I've never had the opportunity to feel ... that." Desire, 
lust, she didn't know. And she didn't know how or why they'd wound up 
talking about this. 

"Why?" And with all of Lorcan's considerable focus honed in on her, 
with the way he'd glanced at her red-painted mouth, Elide wanted to tell 
him. About the tower, and Vernon, and her parents. About why, if she were 
to ever feel desire, it'd be a result of trusting someone so much that those 





horrors faded away, a result of knowing they would fight tooth and claw to 
keep her free and never lock her up or hurt her or leave her. 
Elide opened her mouth. Then the screaming started. 


Lorcan didn't know why the hell he was in Marion's ridiculous little 
oracle's tent. He needed to wash, needed to clean away the sweat and oil 
and feel of all those ogling eyes on him. 

But he'd spotted Marion in the crowd while he'd finished up his piss- 
poor performance. He hadn't seen her earlier in the evening before she'd 
put on that headdress and those robes, but ... maybe it was the cosmetics, 
the heavy kohl around her eyes, the way the red-painted lips made her 
mouth look like a fresh piece of fruit, but ... he'd noticed her. 

Noticed the way the men had spotted her, too. Some had outright 
gawked, wonder and lust written across their bodies, as Marion lingered, 
oblivious, at the edge of the crowd and watched Lorcan instead. 

Beautiful. After a few weeks of eating, of safety, the terrified, gaunt 
young woman had somehow gone from pretty to beautiful. He'd ended his 
performance sooner than he'd intended, and by the time he looked up again, 
Marion was gone. 

Like a gods-damned dog, he'd picked up her scent among the crowd 
and followed her back to this tent. 

In the shadows and glowing lights within, with the headdress and 
dangling beads and dark red robes ... the oracle incarnate. Serene, exquisite 
... and utterly forbidden. 

And he'd been so focused on cursing himself for staring at that ripe, 
sinful mouth while she admitted she was still untouched, that he hadn't 
detected anything amiss until the screaming started. 

No, he'd been too busy contemplating what sounds might come from 
that full mouth if he slowly, gently, taught her the art of the bedroom. 

The attack, Lorcan supposed, was Hellas's way of telling him to keep 
his cock in his pants and mind out of the gutter. 

"Get under a wagon and stay there," he snapped before hurtling out of 
the tent. He didn't wait to see if she obeyed. Marion was smart--she knew 


she'd stand a better chance at survival if she listened to him and found 
shelter. 

Lorcan loosed his gift through the panicking carnival site--a wave of 
dark, terrible power sweeping out in a ripple, then rushing back to tell him 
what it sensed. His power was gleeful, breathless in a way he knew too 
well: death. 

At one end of the field lay the outskirts of the little town. At the other, a 
copse of trees and endless night--and wings. 

Towering, sinewy forms plunged down from the skies--his magic 
picked up four. Four ilken as they landed, claws out and baring those flesh- 
shredding teeth. The leathery wings, it seemed, marked them as some slight 
variation of the ones who had tracked them in Oakwald. A variation--or a 
refining of an already ruthless hunter. 

People ran, screaming--toward the town, toward the cover of the dark 
fields beyond. 

Those distant fires had not been set by farmers to burn their idle fields. 

They had been set to cloud the skies, to hide the scent of these beasts. 
From him. Or any other gifted warriors. 

Marion. They were hunting Marion. 

The carnival was in chaos, the horses were shrieking and bucking. 
Lorcan plunged toward where the four ilken had landed in the heart of the 
camp, right where he'd been performing minutes before, in time to see one 
land atop a fleeing young man and flip him onto his back. 

The young man was still screaming for gods who would not answer as 
the ilken leaned down, flicking free a long talon, and opened up his belly in 
a smooth swipe. He was still screaming when the ilken lowered his 
mutilated face and feasted. 

"What in burning hell are those beasts?" It was Ombriel, a long-sword 
out--and gripped in a way that told him she knew how to wield it. Nik 
came thundering up behind her, two rough, near-rusted blades in his meaty 
hands. 

"Soldiers from Morath," was all Lorcan supplied. Nik was eyeing the 
blade and hatchet Lorcan had drawn, and he didn't think to pretend to not 
know how to use either, to be a simple man from the wilds, as he said with 
cold precision, "They're naturally able to cut through most magic--and 
only beheading will keep them down." 


"They're nearly eight feet," Ombriel said, face pale. 

Lorcan left them to their assessments and fear, stepping into the ring of 
light in the heart of the camp as the four ilken finished playing with the 
young man. The human was still alive, silently mouthing pleas for help. 

Lorcan lashed out with his power and could have sworn the young man 
had gratitude in his eyes as death kissed him in greeting. 

The ilken looked up as one, hissing softly. Blood slid from their teeth. 

Lorcan tunneled into his power, preparing to distract and addle them, if 
their resistance to magic held true. Perhaps Marion would have time to run. 
The ilken who had ripped open the belly of the young man said to him, 
laughter dancing on its gray tongue, "Are you the one in charge?" 

Lorcan simply said, "Yes." 

It told him enough. They did not know who he was, his role in Marion's 
escape. 

The four ilken smiled. "We seek a girl. She murdered our kin--and 
several others." 

They blamed her for the ilken's death those weeks ago? Or was it an 
excuse to further their own ends? "We tracked her to the Acanthus crossing 
... She may be hiding here, among your people." A sneer. 

Lorcan willed Nik and Ombriel to keep their mouths shut. If they so 
much as started to reveal them, the hatchet in his hands would move. 

"Check another carnival. We've had this crew for months." 

"She is small," it went on, those too-human eyes flickering. "Crippled 
on one leg." 

"We don't know anyone like that." 

They'd hunt her to the ends of the earth. 

"Then line up your crew so we might ... inspect them." 

Make them walk. Look them over. Look for a dark-haired young 
woman with a limp and whatever other markers her uncle had provided. 

"You've scared them all away. It might be days before they return. And, 
again,' Lorcan said, hatchet flicking a bit higher, "there is no one in my 
caravan who matches such a description." Behind him, Nik and Ombriel 
were silent, their terror a reek that shoved itself up his nose. Lorcan willed 
Marion to remain hidden. 

The ilken smiled--the most hideous smile Lorcan had beheld in all his 
centuries. "We have gold." Indeed, the ilken beside it had a hip-pouch 


sagging with it. "Her name is Elide Lochan. Her uncle is Lord of Perranth. 
He will reward you handsomely to turn her over." 

The words hit Lorcan like stones. Marion--Elide had ... lied. Had 
managed to keep him from even sniffing the lie on her, had used enough 
truths and her own general fear to keep the scent of it hidden-- 

"We know no one by such a name," Lorcan said again. 

"Pity," the sentinel crooned. "For if you had her in your company, we 
would have taken her and left. But now..." The ilken smiled at its three 
companions, and their dark wings rustled. "Now it seems we have flown a 
very long way for nothing. And we are very hungry." 


Chapter 41


Elide had squeezed herself into a hidden floor compartment in the largest of 
the wagons and prayed that no one discovered her. Or began burning things. 
Her frantic breathing was the only sound. The air grew tight and hot, her 
legs trembled and cramped from staying curled in a ball, but still she 
waited, still she kept hidden. 

Lorcan had run out--he'd just run into the fray. She'd fled the tent in 
time to see four ilken--winged ilken--descend upon the camp. She had not 
lingered long enough to see what happened after. 

Time passed--minutes or perhaps hours, she couldn't tell. 

She had done this. She had brought these things here, to these people, to 
the caravan... 

The screaming grew louder, then faded. Then nothing. 

Lorcan might be dead. Everyone might be dead. 

Her ears strained, and she tried to quiet her breathing to listen for any 
sounds of life, of action beyond her small, hot hiding space. No doubt, it 
was usually reserved for smuggling contraband--not at all intended for a 
human being. 

She couldn't stay hidden much longer. If the ilken slaughtered them all, 
they'd search for any survivors. Could likely sniff her out. 

She would have to make a run for it. Have to break out, observe what 
she could, and sprint for the dark fields and pray no others waited out there. 
Her feet and calves had gone numb minutes before and now tingled 
incessantly. She might very well not even be able to walk, and her stupid, 
useless leg-- 

She listened again, praying to Anneith to turn the ilken's attention 
elsewhere. 

Only silence greeted her. No more screaming. 

Now. She should go now, while she had the cover of darkness. 


Elide did not give her fear another heartbeat to whisper its poison into 
her blood. She had survived Morath, survived weeks alone. She'd make it, 
she had to make it, and she wouldn't at all mind being the queen's gods- 
damned dishwasher if it meant she could /ive-- 

Elide uncoiled, shoulders aching as she quietly eased the trapdoor up, 
the little area rug sliding back. She scanned the interior of the wagon--the 
empty benches on either side--then studied the night beckoning beyond. 
Light spilled from the camp behind her, but ahead ... a sea of blackness. 
The field was perhaps thirty feet away. 

Elide winced as the wood groaned while she hefted the trapdoor high 
enough for her to slither, belly-down, over the floorboards. But her robe 
snagged, yanking her into a stop. Elide gritted her teeth, tugging blindly. 
But it had caught inside the crawl space. Anneith save her-- 

"Tell me," drawled a deep male voice behind her, from near the driver's 
seat. "What would you have done if I were an ilken soldier?" 

Relief turned her bones to liquid, and Elide held in her sob. She twisted 
to find Lorcan covered in black blood, sitting on the bench behind the 
driver's seat, legs spread before him. His axe and sword lay discarded 
beside him, coated in that black blood as well, and Lorcan idly chewed on a 
long stalk of wheat as he gazed at the canvas wall of the wagon. 

"The first thing I might have done in your place," Lorcan mused, still 
not looking at her, "would have been to ditch the robe. You'd fall flat on 
your face if you ran--and the red would be as good as ringing the dinner 
bell." 

She tugged at the robe again, and the fabric ripped at last. Scowling, she 
patted where it had come free and found a loose bit of wood paneling. 

"The second thing I might have done," Lorcan went on, not even 
bothering to wipe away the blood splattered on his face, "is tell me the 
gods-damned truth. Did you know those ilken beasts Jove to talk with the 
right encouragement? And they told me some very, very interesting things." 
Those dark eyes at last slid to her, utterly vicious. "But you didn't tell me 
the truth, did you, Elide?" 


Her eyes were wide, her face leeched of color beneath the cosmetics. She'd 
lost the headdress somewhere, and her dark sheet of hair slid free of some 
of its pins as she climbed from the hidden compartment. Lorcan watched 
every movement, assessing and weighing and debating what, exactly, to do 
with her. 

Liar. Cunning little liar. 

Elide Lochan, rightful Lady of Perranth, crawled out, slamming the 
trapdoor shut and glaring at him from where she knelt on the floor. He 
glared right back. "Why should I have trusted you," she said with 
impressive coldness, "when you were stalking me for days in the forest? 
Why should I have told you a thing about me when you could have sold me 
to the highest bidder?" 

His body ached; his head throbbed from the slaughter he'd barely 
managed to survive. The ilken had gone down--but not willingly. And the 
one he'd kept alive, the one Nik and Ombriel had begged him to kill and be 
done with, had told him very little, actually. 

But Lorcan had decided his wife didn't need to know that. Decided it 
was time to see what she might reveal if he let some lies of his own fool 
her. 

Elide glanced at his weapons, at the reeking blood coating him like oil. 
"You killed them all?" 

He lowered the wheat stalk from his mouth. "Do you think I'd be sitting 
here if I hadn't?" 

Elide Lochan wasn't some mere human trying to return to her homeland 
and serve her queen. She was a royal-blooded /ady who wanted to get back 
to that fire-breathing bitch in the North to offer whatever aid she could. She 
and Aelin would be well suited for each other, he decided. The sweet-faced 
liar and the insufferable, haughty princess. 

Elide slumped onto the bench, massaging her feet and calves. 

"I'm risking my neck for you," he said too quietly, "and yet you decided 
not to tell me that your uncle isn't just a mere commander at Morath, but 
Erawan's right hand--and you are his prized possession." 

"I told you enough of the truth. Who I am makes no difference. And I 
am no one's possession." 

His temper yanked at the leash he'd been careful to keep short before 
tracking her scent to this wagon. Outside, the others were hurriedly 


packing, readying to flee into the night before the villagers decided to 
blame them for the disaster. "It does make a difference who you are. With 
your queen on the move, your uncle knows she'd pay a steep price to get 
you back. You are not a mere breeding asset--you are a negotiation tool. 
You might very well be what brings that bitch to her knees." 

Rage flashed in her fine-boned face. "You keep plenty of secrets, too, 
Lorcan." She spat his name like a curse. "And I still haven't been able to 
decide if I find it insulting or amusing that you think I'm too stupid to 
notice. That you thought I was some fear-addled girl, too grateful for the 
presence of such a strong, brooding warrior to even question why you were 
there or what you wanted or what your stake in all this is. I gave you 
exactly what you wanted to see: a lost young woman in need of help, 
perhaps a bit skilled at lying and deceit, but ultimately not worth more than 
a few seconds' consideration. And you, in all your immortal arrogance, 
didn't think twice. Why should you, when humans are so useless? Why 
should you even bother, when you planned to abandon me the moment you 
got what you needed?" 

Lorcan blinked, bracing his feet on the floor. She didn't back down an 
inch. 

He couldn't remember the last time anyone had spoken to him like that. 
"I would be careful what you say to me." 

Elide gave him a hateful little smile. "Or what? You'll sell me to 
Morath? Use me as your ticket in?" 

"I hadn't thought to do that, but thank you for the idea." 

Her throat bobbed, the only sign of her fear. And she said clearly and 
without a hint of hesitation, "If you try to bring me to Morath, I will end my 
own life before you can carry me over the Keep's bridge." 

It was the threat, the promise, that checked his anger, his utter rage that 
... that she had indeed played into his expectations of her, his arrogance and 
prejudices. He said carefully, "What is it that you're carrying that makes 
them hunt you so relentlessly? Not your royal blood, not your magic and 
use for breeding. The object you carry with you--what is it?" 

Perhaps it was a night for truth, perhaps death hovered close enough to 
make her a bit reckless, but Elide said, "It's a gift--for Celaena Sardothien. 
From a woman kept imprisoned in Morath, who had waited a long time to 
repay her for a past kindness. More than that, I don't know." 


A gift for an assassin--not the queen. Perhaps nothing of note, but-- 
"Let me see it." 

"No." 

They stared each other down again. And Lorcan knew that if he wanted, 
he could wait until she was asleep, take it for himself, and vanish. See what 
might make her so protective of it. 

But he knew ... some small, stupid part of him knew that if he took 
from this woman who had already had too much stolen from her ... He 
didn't know if there was any coming back from that. He'd done such 
despicable, vicious things over the centuries and hadn't thought twice. He'd 
reveled in them, relished them, the cruelty. 

But this ... there was a line. Somehow ... somehow there was a gods- 
damned line here. 

She seemed to pick up on his decision--with whatever gift she had. Her 
shoulders slumped, and she stared blankly at the canvas wall as the sounds 
of their group now grew closer, their urging to hurry and pack, leave what 
could be spared. 

Elide said quietly, "Marion was my mother's name. She died defending 
Aelin Galathynius from her assassin. My mother bought Aelin time to run 
--to get away so she could one day return to save us all. My uncle, Vernon, 
watched and smiled as my father, the Lord of Perranth, was executed 
outside our castle. Then he took my father's title and lands and home. And 
for the next ten years, my uncle locked me in the highest tower of Perranth 
Castle, with only my nursemaid for company. When I broke my foot and 
ankle, he did not trust healers enough to let them treat it. He kept bars on 
the tower windows to keep me from killing myself, and shackled my ankles 
to keep me from running. I left for the first time in a decade when he 
shoved me into a prison wagon and dragged me down to Morath. There, he 
made me work as a servant--for the humiliation and terror he delights in. I 
planned and dreamed of escaping every day. And when the time came ... I 
took my chance. I did not know about the ilken, had only heard rumors of 
fell things being bred in the mountains beyond the Keep. I have no lands, 
no money, no army to offer Aelin Galathynius. But I will find her--and 
help her in whatever way I can. If only to keep just one girl, just one, from 
ever enduring what I did." 


He let the truth in her words sink into him. Let them adjust his view of 
her. His ... plans. 

Lorcan said roughly, "I am over five hundred years old. I am blood- 
sworn to Queen Maeve of the Fae, and I am her second-in-command. I have 
done great and terrible things in her name, and I will do more before death 
comes to claim me. I was born a bastard on the streets of Doranelle, ran 
wild with the other discarded children until I realized my talents were 
different. Maeve noticed, too. I can kill faster--I can sense when death is 
near. I think my magic is death, given to me by Hellas himself. I am in these 
lands on behalf of my queen--though I came without her permission. She 
might very well hunt me down and kill me for it. If her sentinels arrive 
looking for me, it is in your best interest to pretend not to know who and 
what I am." There was more, but ... Elide had remaining secrets, too. 
They'd offered each other enough for now. 

No fear tainted her scent--not even a trace of it. All Elide said was, "Do 
you have a family?" 

"No." 

"Do you have friends?" 

"No." His cabal of warriors didn't count. Gods-damned Whitethorn 
hadn't seemed to care when he abandoned them to serve Aelin Galathynius; 
Fenrys made no secret he hated the bond; Vaughan was barely around; he 
couldn't stand Gavriel's unbreakable restraint; and Connall was too busy 
rutting Maeve like an animal most of the time. 

Elide angled her head, her hair sliding across her face. He almost lifted 
a hand to brush it back and read her dark eyes. But his hands were covered 
in that filthy blood. And he had the feeling Elide Lochan did not wish to be 
touched unless she asked to be. 

"Then," she murmured, "'you and I are the same in that regard, at least." 

No family, no friends. It hadn't seemed quite so pathetic until she said 
it, until he suddenly saw himself through her eyes. 

But Elide shrugged, rising to her feet as Molly's voice barked from 
nearby. "You should clean up--you look like a warrior again." 

He wasn't sure if she meant it as a compliment. "Nik and Ombriel, 
unfortunately, realized you and I are perhaps not what we seem." 

Alarm flashed in her eyes. "Should we leave--" 


"No. They'll keep our secrets." If only because they'd seen Lorcan lay 
into those ilken, and knew precisely what he could do to them if they so 
much as breathed wrong in their direction. "We can stay awhile yet--auntil 
we get clear of this." 

Elide nodded, her limp deep as she headed for the back of the wagon. 
She sat on the edge before climbing off, her wrecked ankle too weak and 
painful to ever jump. Yet she moved with quiet dignity, hissing a little as 
her foot made contact with the ground. 

Lorcan watched her limp into the night without so much as a backward 
glance at him. 

And he wondered what the hell he was doing. 


Chapter 42


Death smelled like salt and blood and wood and rot. 

And it hurt. 

Darkness embrace her, it hurt like hell. The Ancient Ones had lied that it 
cured all ills, if the slice of pain across her abdomen was any indication. 
Not to mention the pounding headache, the sheer dryness of her mouth, the 
burning sting in the other cut on her arm. 

Perhaps the Darkness was another world, another realm. Perhaps she'd 
gone to the hell-realm the humans so feared. 

She hated Death. 

And Death could go to hell, too-- 


Manon Blackbeak cracked open eyelids that were too heavy, too burning, 
and squinted against the flickering lantern light that swayed upon the wood 
panels of the room in which she lay. 

Not a real bedroom, she realized by the reek of salt and rocking and 
creaking of the world around her. A cabin--on a ship. 

A small, dingy one, with barely space for this bed, a porthole too small 
for her shoulders to even squeeze through-- 

She bolted upright. Abraxos. Where was Abraxos-- 

"Relax," drawled a too-familiar female voice from the shadowed space 
near the foot of the bed. 

Pain flared in Manon's belly, a delayed response to her sudden 
movement, and she glanced between the white bandages that now scratched 
against her fingers and the young queen, lounging in the chair by the door. 
Glanced between the woman and the chains now around Manon's wrists, 
around her ankles--anchored into the walls with what appeared to be 
freshly drilled holes. 


"Looks like you owe me a life debt once more, Blackbeak," Aelin 
Galathynius said, cold humor in her turquoise eyes. Elide. Had Elide made 
it here-- 

"Your fussy nursemaid of a wyvern is fine, by the way. I don't know 
how you wound up with a sweet thing like that for a mount, but he's content 
to sprawl in the sun on the foredeck. Can't say it makes the sailors 
particularly happy--especially cleaning up after him." 

Find somewhere safe, she'd told Abraxos. Had he somehow found the 
queen? Somehow known this was the only place she might stand a chance 
of surviving? 

Aelin braced her feet on the floor, boots thudding softly. There was a 
frank sort of impatience with any sort of bullshit that had not been there the 
last time Manon had seen the woman. As if the warrior who had laughed 
her way through their battle atop Temis's temple had lost a bit of that 
wicked amusement but gained more of the cunning cruelty. 

Manon's belly gave a throb of pain that made her bite her lip to keep 
from hissing. 

"Whoever gave you that wound wasn't joking," the queen said. 
"Trouble at home?" 

It wasn't the queen's business, or anyone else's. "Let me heal, and then 
PII be on my way," Manon rasped, her tongue a dried, heavy husk. 

"Oh, no," Aelin purred. "You're not going anywhere. Your mount may 
do whatever he pleases, but you are now officially our prisoner." 

Manon's head started spinning, but she forced herself to say, "Our?" 

A knowing little smile. Then the queen rose gracefully. Her hair was 
longer, face leaner, those turquoise eyes hard and haunted. The queen said 
simply, "Here are the rules, Blackbeak. You try to escape, you die. You hurt 
anyone, you die. You somehow bring any of us into trouble ... I think you 
get where I'm going with this. You step one foot out of line, and PI finish 
what we started that day in the forest, life debt or no. This time I don't need 
steel to do it." 

As she spoke, gold flames seemed to flicker in her eyes. And Manon 
realized with no small thrill, even with her pain, that the queen could indeed 
end her before she'd get close enough to kill. 

Aelin turned for the door, her scarred hand on the knob. "I found iron 
splinters in your belly before I healed you. I suggest you don't lie to 


whoever can tolerate being around you long enough to get the full story." 
She jerked her chin toward the floor. A pitcher and cup lay there. ""Water's 
next to the bed. If you can reach it." 

Then she was gone. 

Manon listened to her steady footsteps fade. No other voices or sounds 
beyond the lap of waves against the ship, the groan of the wood, and-- 
gulls. They had to still be within range of the coast, then. Sailing to where 
... She'd have to figure that out. 

Once she healed. Once she got out of these irons. Once she got onto 
Abraxos. 

But to go where? To whom? 

There was no aerie to receive her, no Clan who would shield her from 
her grandmother. And the Thirteen ... Where were they now? Had they 
been hunted down? 

Manon's stomach burned, but she reached for the water. Pain lashed her 
hard enough that she gave up after a heartbeat. 

They had heard, no doubt--what she was. The Thirteen had heard. 

Not just a half-blooded Crochan ... but the last Crochan Queen. 

And her sister ... her half sister... 

Manon stared at the shadowed, wooden ceiling. 

She could feel that Crochan's blood on her hands. And her cape ... that 
red cape was draped over the edge of the bed. Her sister's cape. That her 
grandmother had made her wear, knowing who it belonged to, knowing 
whose throat Manon had slit. 

No longer the Blackbeak heir, Crochan blood or no. 

Despair curled like a cat around the pain in Manon's belly. She was no 
one and nothing. 

She did not remember falling asleep. 


The witch slept for three days after Aelin reported that she had awakened. 
Dorian went into that cramped cabin with Rowan and the queen every time 
they healed a little bit more of her, observing the way their magic worked, 
but not daring to try it on the unconscious Blackbeak. 


Even unconscious, Manon's every breath, every twitch, was a reminder 
that she was a born predator, her agonizingly beautiful face a careful mask 
to lure the unwary to their doom. 

It felt fitting, somehow, considering that they were likely sailing to their 
own doom. 

As Rolfe's two ships had escorted them down the coast of Eyllwe, 
they'd kept well away from the shore. A wicked storm had them mooring 
among the small cluster of islands off Leriba's waters, and they'd only 
survived thanks to Rowan's own winds shielding them. Most of them had 
still spent the entirely of it with their head in a bucket. Himself included. 

They were nearing Banjali now--and Dorian had tried and failed not to 
think of his dead friend with every league closer to the lovely city. Tried 
and failed not to consider if Nehemia would have been with them on this 
very ship had things not gone so terribly wrong. Tried and failed not to 
contemplate if that touch she'd once given him--the Wyrdmark she'd 
sketched over his chest--had somehow ... awakened that power of his. If it 
had been a curse as much as a blessing. 

He hadn't had the nerve to ask what Aelin was feeling, though he found 
her frequently staring toward the coast--even if they couldn't see it, even if 
they wouldn't get close. 

Another week--perhaps less, if Rowan's magic helped--would have 
them at the eastern edge of the Stone Marshes. And once they were in range 
... they'd have to trust Rolfe's vague directions to guide them. 

And avoid Melisande's armada--Erawan's armada now, he supposed-- 
waiting just around the peninsula in the Gulf of Oro. 

But for now ... Dorian was on watch in Manon's room, none of them 
taking any risks where the Blackbeak heir was concerned. 

He cleared his throat as her eyelids shifted, her dark lashes bobbing up 
--then lifting wholly. 

Gold sleep-murky eyes met his. 

"Hello, witchling," he said. 

Her full, sensuous mouth tightened slightly, either in a repressed 
grimace or smile, he couldn't tell. But she sat up, her moon-white hair 
sliding forward--her chains clanking. "Hello, princeling," she said. Gods, 
her voice was like sandpaper. 

He glanced at the water jug. "Care for a drink?" 


She had to be parched. They'd barely been able to get a trickle down her 
throat, not wanting to risk her choking or freeing those iron teeth from 
wherever she kept them. 

Manon studied the pitcher, then him. "Am I your prisoner, too?" 

"My life debt is paid," he said simply. "You're nothing to me at all." 

"What happened," she rasped. An order--and one he allowed her to 
make. 

But he filled the glass, trying not to look like he was calculating her 
range in those chains as he handed it to her. No sign of her iron nails as her 
slim fingers wrapped around the cup. She winced slightly, winced a bit 
more as she lifted it to her still-pale lips--and drank. And drank. 

She drained the glass. Dorian silently refilled it for her. Once. Twice. 
Thrice. 

When she at last finished, he said, "Your wyvern flew straight as an 
arrow for us. You tumbled off the saddle and into the water barely fifty 
yards from our ship. How he found us, we don't know. We got you out of 
the water--Rowan himself had to temporarily bind your stomach on the 
deck before we could even move you down here. It's a miracle you're not 
dead from blood loss alone. Never mind infection. We had you down here 
for a week, Aelin and Rowan working on you--they had to cut you open 
again in some spots to get the bad flesh out. You've been in and out of it 
since." 

Dorian didn't feel like mentioning that he'd been the one who'd jumped 
into the water. He'd just ... acted, as Manon had acted when she'd saved 
him in his tower. He owed her nothing less. Lysandra, in sea dragon form, 
had caught up to them moments later, and he'd held the water-heavy Manon 
in his arms as he'd climbed onto the shifter's back. The witch had been so 
pale, and the wound on her stomach ... He'd almost lost his breakfast at the 
sight of it. She looked like a fish who'd been sloppily gutted. 

Gutted, Aelin had confirmed an hour later when she held up a small 
sliver of metal, by someone with very, very sharp iron nails. 

None of them had mentioned that it might have been punishment--for 
saving him. 

Manon was assessing the room with eyes quickly clearing. "Where are 
we." 

"On the sea." 


Aelin had ordered he not give her any information about their plans and 
whereabouts. 

"Are you hungry?" he asked, wondering what, exactly, she might eat. 

Indeed, those gold eyes slashed to his throat. 

"Really?" He lifted a brow. 

Her nostrils flared slightly. "Only for sport." 

"Aren't you ... partially human, at least?" 

"Not in the ways that count." 

Right--because the other parts ... Fae, Valg ... It was Valg blood that 
had shaped the witches. The very prince that had infested him shared blood 
with her. From the black pit of his memory, images and words slithered out 
--of that prince seeing the gold eyes Dorian now met, screeching at him to 
get away ... Eyes of the Valg kings. He said carefully, "So would you 
consider yourself more Valg than human, then?" 

"The Valg are my enemy--Erawan is my enemy." 

"And does that make us allies?" 

She revealed no indication either way. "Is there a young woman in your 
company named Elide?" 

"No." Who in hell was that? "We've never encountered anyone with 
that name." 

Manon closed her eyes for a heartbeat. Her slender throat bobbed. 
"Have you heard news of my Thirteen?" 

"You're the first rider and wyvern we've seen in weeks." He 
contemplated why she'd asked, why she'd gone so still. "You don't know if 
they're alive." 

And with those iron shavings in her gut... 

Manon's voice was flat and cold as death. "Tell Aelin Galathynius not 
to bother using me for negotiations. The Blackbeak Matron will not 
acknowledge me, either as heir or witch, and all you will get out of it is 
revealing your precise location." 

His magic flickered. "What happened after Rifthold?" 

Manon lay back down, angling her head away from him. Spindrift from 
the open porthole caught in her white hair and set it shimmering in the dim 
cabin. "Everything has a price." 

And it was those words, the fact that the witch had turned her face away 
and seemed to be waiting for death to claim her, that made him croon, "I 


once told you to find me again--it seems like you couldn't wait to see my 
handsome face." 

Her shoulders stiffened slightly. "I'm hungry." 

He smiled slowly. 

As if she'd heard that smile, Manon glared. "Food." 

But there was still an edge--a too-fragile edge limning every line of her 
body. Whatever had happened, whatever she had endured ... Dorian draped 
an arm along the back of his chair. "It's coming in a few minutes. I'd hate 
for you to waste away into nothing. Itd be a shame to lose the most 
beautiful woman in the world so soon into her immortal, wicked life." 

"I am not a woman," was all she said. But hot temper laced those 
molten gold eyes. 

He gave her an indolent shrug, perhaps only because she was indeed in 
chains, perhaps because, even though the death she radiated thrilled him, it 
did not strike a chord of fear. "Witch, woman ... as long as the parts that 
matter are there, what difference does it make?" 

She eased into a sitting position, disbelief and exhausted outrage on that 
perfect face. She bared her teeth in a silent snarl. 

Dorian offered a lazy grin in return. "Believe it or not, this ship has an 
unnatural number of attractive men and women on board. You'll fit right in. 
And fit in with the cranky immortals, I suppose." 

She glanced toward the door moments before he heard approaching 
footsteps. They were silent until the knob turned, revealing Aedion's 
frowning face. "Awake and ready to rip out throats, it seems," the general 
said by way of greeting. Dorian rose, taking the tray of what looked to be 
fish stew from him. He wondered if he should test it for poison from the 
look Aedion was giving Manon. She glared right back at the golden-haired 
warrior. 

Aedion said, "I would have shot you and your runt of a wyvern clean 
out of the sky if given my way. Be grateful my queen finds you more useful 
alive." 

Then he was gone. 

Dorian set the tray within Manon's reach and watched her sniff at it. She 
took a slow, cautious bite--as if letting it slide into her healing belly and 
seeing how it settled there. As if indeed testing it for poison. While she 
waited, Manon said, "You don't give orders on this ship?" 


It was a focused effort not to bristle. "You know my circumstances. I am 
now at the mercy of my friends." 

"And the Queen of Terrasen is your friend?" 

"There is no one else I'd want guarding my back." Other than Chaol, 
but ... it was no use even thinking about him, missing him. 

Manon at last took another bite of her fish stew. Then another. And 
another. 

And he realized she was avoiding speaking to him. Enough so that he 
asked, "It was your grandmother who did that to you, wasn't it?" 

Her spoon stilled in the chipped wooden bowl. Slowly, she turned her 
face toward him. Unreadable, a face crafted of nightmares and midnight 
fantasies. 

"I'm sorry," he admitted, "if the cost of saving me that day in Rifthold 
was ... was this." 

"Find out if my Thirteen are alive, princeling. Do that, and I am yours to 
command." 

"Where did you last see them?" 

Nothing. She swallowed another spoonful. 

He pushed, "Were they present when your grandmother did that to 
you?" 

Her shoulders curved a bit, and she scooped another spoonful of cloudy 
liquid but didn't sip. "The cost of Rifthold was the life of my Second. I 
refused to pay it. So I bought my Thirteen time to run. The moment I swung 
my sword at my grandmother, my title, my legion, was forfeit. I lost the 
Thirteen while I fled. I do not know if they are alive, or if they have been 
hunted down." Her eyes snapped to his, bright from more than the steam of 
her stew. "Find them for me. Learn if they live or if they have returned to 
the Darkness." 

"We're in the middle of the ocean. There won't be news of anything for 
a while." 

She went back to eating. "They are all I have left." 

"Then I suppose you and I are both heirs without crowns." 

A humorless snort. Her white hair shifted in the sea breeze. 

Dorian rose and walked to the door. "TI do what I can." 

"And--Elide." 

Again, that name. "Who is she?" 


But Manon was back at her stew. "Just tell Aelin Galathynius that Elide 
Lochan is alive--and looking for her." 


The conversation with the king took everything out of her. Once that food 
was in her belly, once she'd downed more water, Manon lay back in bed 
and slept. 

And slept. 

And slept. 

The door banged open at one point, and she had the vague recollection 
of the Queen of Terrasen, then her general-prince, demanding answers 
about something. Elide, perhaps. 

But Manon had lain there, half awake, unwilling to think or speak. She 
wondered if she would have stopped bothering to breathe, if her body 
hadn't done it all on its own. 

She had not realized how impossible the survival of the Thirteen might 
indeed have been until she was practically begging Dorian Havilliard to 
find them for her. Until she had found herself desperate enough to sell her 
sword for any news of them. 

If they even wanted to serve her after everything. A Blackbeak--and a 
Crochan. 

And her parents ... murdered by her grandmother. They had promised 
the world a child of peace. And she had let her grandmother hone her into a 
child of war. 

The thoughts swirled and eddied, sapping her strength, muting colors 
and sounds. She awoke and saw to her needs when necessary, ate when 
food was left, but she let that heavy, meaningless sleep take hold. 

Sometimes, Manon dreamed that she was in that room in the Omega, 
her half sister's blood on her hands and in her mouth. Sometimes, she stood 
beside her grandmother, a witch fully grown and not the witchling she'd 
been at the time, and helped the Matron carve up a handsome, bearded man 
who begged for her life--his offspring's life. Sometimes, she flew over a 
lush green land, the song of a western wind singing her home. 

Often, the dream was that a great cat, pale and speckled like old snow 
on granite, sat in the cabin with her, its long tail slashing back and forth 


when it noticed her glazed attention. Sometimes, it was a grinning white 
wolf. Or a calm-eyed golden mountain lion. 
Manon wished they'd put their jaws around her throat and crunch down. 
They never did. 
So Manon Blackbeak slept. And so she dreamed. 


Chapter 43


Lorcan was still wondering what the hell he was doing three days later. 
They'd left that plains town far behind them, but the terror of that night lay 
draped over the carnival caravan like a heavy blanket with each mile the 
wagons hurried down the roads. 

The others hadn't wised up to how, exactly, they'd survived the ilken-- 
hadn't realized the ilken were near-impossible to kill, and no mere mortal 
could have slain one, let alone four. Nik and Ombriel gave him and Elide a 
wide berth--and only catching their wary, examining stares at the dinner 
campfire every night revealed they were still piecing together who and what 
he was. 

Elide kept well away from him, too. They hadn't had a chance to set up 
their usual tents thanks to fleeing so quickly, but tonight, safely within the 
walls of a small plains town, they'd have to share a room at the cheap inn 
Molly had begrudgingly paid for. 

It was hard not to watch Elide as she took in the town, then the inn--the 
keen-eyed observation, the hint of surprise and confusion that sometimes 
crossed her face. 

He used a tendril of his magic to keep her foot stabilized. She never 
commented on it. And sometimes that dark, fell magic of his would brush 
up against whatever it was she carried--the gift from a dying woman to a 
hotheaded assassin--and recoil. 

Lorcan hadn't pushed to see it since that night, though he'd spent a great 
deal of time contemplating what might have come out of Morath. Collars 
and rings were likely the start of it. 

Whitethorn and the bitch-queen had no idea about the ilken--perhaps 
about the majority of horrors Elide had shared with him. He wondered what 
a wall of wildfire would do to the creatures--wondered if the ilken were 


somehow training against Aelin Galathynius's arsenal. If Erawan was 
smart, he'd have something in mind. 

While the others trudged into the ramshackle inn in search of food and 
rest, Elide informed Molly that she was going on a walk along the river, and 
headed into the cobblestone streets. And though his stomach was 
grumbling, Lorcan trailed her, ever the husband wishing to guard his 
beautiful wife in a town that had seen better days--decades. No doubt 
caused by Adarlan's relentless road-building across the continent and the 
fact that this town had been left far from any artery through the land. 

The thunderstorm he'd scented building on the horizon lumbered 
toward the stone-wrought town, the light shifting from gold to silver. 
Within minutes, the thick humidity was washed away by a sweep of 
welcome coolness. Lorcan gave Elide all of three blocks before he fell into 
step beside her and said, "It's going to rain." 

She slid a flat glance at him. "I do know what thunder means." 

The walled town had been built on either side of a small, half-forgotten 
river--two large water gates on either end demanding tolls to enter the city 
and tracking the goods that passed through. Old water, fish, and rotting 
wood reached him before the sight of the muddy, calm waters did, and it 
was precisely at the edge of the river docks that Elide paused. 

"What are you looking for?" he asked at last, an eye on the darkening 
skies. The dockworkers, sailors, and merchants monitored the clouds, too, 
as they scurried about. Some lingered to tie up the long, flat-bellied barges 
and latch down the smooth poles they used to navigate the river. He'd seen 
a kingdom, perhaps three hundred years ago, that relied on barges to sail its 
goods from one end to another. Its name eluded him, lost to the catacombs 
of his memory. Lorcan wondered if it still existed, tucked away between 
two mountain ranges on the other side of the world. 

Elide's bright eyes tracked a group of well-dressed men heading into 
what looked to be a tavern. "Storms mean looking for shelter," she 
murmured. "Shelter means being stuck inside with nothing to do but gossip. 
Gossip means news from merchants and sailors about the rest of the land." 
Those eyes cut to him, dry humor dancing there. "That is what thunder 
means." 

Lorcan blinked as she followed after the men who'd entered the 
dockside tavern. The first fat drops of the storm plunked onto the moss- 


speckled cobblestones of the quay. 

Lorcan followed Elide inside the tavern, some part of him admitting that 
for all his five hundred years of surviving and killing and serving, he'd 
never quite encountered someone so ... unimpressed with him. Even gods- 
damned Aelin had some sense of the threat he posed. Maybe living with 
monsters had stripped away a healthy fear of them. He wondered how Elide 
hadn't become one in the process. 

Lorcan took in the details of the taproom by instinct and training, 
finding nothing worth a second thought. The reek of the place--unwashed 
bodies, piss, mold, wet wool--threatened to suffocate him. But in the span 
of a few moments, Elide had grabbed herself a table near a cluster of those 
people from the docks and ordered two tankards of ale and whatever was 
the lunch special. 

Lorcan slid into the ancient wooden chair beside hers, wondering if the 
damn thing would collapse under him as it groaned. Thunder cracked 
overhead, and all eyes shifted to the bay of windows overlooking the quay. 
Rain fell in earnest, setting the barges bobbing and swaying. 

Lunch was dropped before them, the bowls clattering and sending the 
goopy brown stew splashing over the chipped rims. Elide didn't so much as 
look at it, or touch the ales that were plunked down with equal disinterest 
for a tip, as she scanned the room. 

"Drink," Elide commanded him. 

Lorcan debated telling her not to give him orders, but ... he liked seeing 
this small, fine-boned creature in action. Liked seeing her size up a room of 
strangers and select her prey. Because it was a hunt--for the best and safest 
source of information. The person who wouldn't report to a town garrison 
still under Adarlan's control that a dark-haired young woman was asking 
questions about enemy forces. 

So Lorcan drank and watched her while she watched others. So many 
calculating thoughts beneath that pale face, so many lies ready to spill from 
those rosebud lips. Part of him wondered if his own queen could find her 
useful--if Maeve would also pick up on the fact that it was perhaps Anneith 
herself who'd taught the girl to look and listen and lie. 

Part of him dreaded the thought of Elide in Maeve's hands. What she'd 
become. What Maeve would ask her to do as a spy or courtier. Perhaps it 


was good that Elide was mortal, life span too short for Maeve to bother 
honing her into quite possibly her most vicious sentinel. 

He was so damn busy thinking about it that he nearly didn't notice when 
Elide leaned back casually in her chair and interrupted the table of 
merchants and captains behind them. "What do you mean, Rifthold is 
gone?" 

Lorcan snapped to attention. But they'd heard the news weeks ago. 

The captain nearest them--a woman in her early thirties--sized up 
Elide, then Lorcan, then said, "Well, it's not gone, but ... witches now 
control it, on behalf of Duke Perrington. Dorian Havilliard's been ousted." 

Elide, the cunning little liar, looked outright shocked. "We've been in 
the deep wild for weeks. Is Dorian Havilliard dead?" She whispered the 
words, as if in horror ... and as if to avoid being heard. 

Another person at the table--an older, bearded man--said, "They never 
found his body, but if the duke's declaring him not to be king anymore, I'd 
assume he's alive. No use making proclamations against a dead man." 

Thunder rattled, almost drowning out her whisper as she said, "Would 
he--would he go to the North? To ... her?" 

They knew precisely who Elide meant. And Lorcan knew exactly why 
she'd come here. 

She was going to leave. Tomorrow, whenever the carnival rolled out. 
She'd likely hire one of these boats to take her northward, and he ... he 
would go south. To Morath. 

The companions swapped glances, weighing the appearance of the 
young woman--and then Lorcan. He attempted to smile, to look bland and 
unthreatening. None of them returned the look, though he must have done 
something right, because the bearded man said, "She's not in the North." 

It was Elide's turn to go still. 

The bearded man went on, "Rumor has it, she was in Ilium, trouncing 
soldiers. Then they say she was in Skull's Bay last week, raising hell. Now 
she's sailing elsewhere--some say to Wendlyn, some say to Eyllwe, some 
say she's fleeing to the other side of the world. But she's not in the North. 
Won't be for a while, it seems. Not wise to leave your home undefended, if 
you ask me. But she's barely a woman; she can't know much about warfare 
at all." 








Lorcan doubted that, and doubted the bitch didn't make a move without 
Whitethorn or Gavriel's son weighing in. But Elide loosed a shuddering 
breath. "Why leave Terrasen at all?" 

"Who knows?" The woman turned back to her food and company. 
"Seems like the queen has a habit of showing up where she's least expected, 
unleashing chaos, and vanishing again. There's good money to be had from 
the betting pool about where she'll show up next. I say Banjali, in Eyllwe-- 
Vross here says Varese in Wendlyn." 

"Why Eyllwe?" Elide pushed. 

"Who knows? She'd be a fool indeed to announce her plans." The 
woman gave Elide a sharp look as if to say to keep quiet about it. 

Elide returned to her food and ale, the rain and thunder drowning the 
chatter in the room. 

Lorcan watched her drink the entire tankard in silence. And when it 
seemed the least suspicious, she rose and left. 

Elide went to two other taverns in the town--followed the same exact 
pattern. The news shifted slightly with each recounting, but the general 
consensus was that Aelin was on the move, perhaps south or east, and no 
one knew what to expect. 

Elide walked out of the third tavern, Lorcan on her heels. They hadn't 
spoken once since she'd gone into that first inn. He'd been too lost in 
contemplating what it would be like to suddenly travel on his own again. To 
leave her ... and never see her again. 

And now, staring up at the rain and the thunder, Elide said, "I was 
supposed to go north." 

Lorcan found himself not wanting to confirm or object. Like a useless 
fool, he found himself ... hesitating to push her toward that original path. 

She lowered her face, water and light gilding her high cheekbones. 
"Where do I head now? How do I find her?" 

He dared say, "What did you glean from the rumors?" He'd been 
analyzing each tidbit of information, but wanted to see that clever mind at 
work. 

And some small part of him wanted to see what she'd decide about their 
splitting ways, too. 

Elide said softly, "Banjali--in Eyllwe. I think she's going to Banjali." 


He tried not to look too relieved. He'd arrived at the same conclusion, if 
only because it was what Whitethorn would have done--and he'd trained 
the prince himself for a few decades. 

She scrubbed at her face. "How ... how far is it?" 

"Far." 

She lowered her hands, her features stark and bone white. "How do I get 
there? How do ..." She rubbed at her chest. 

"I can get you a map," he found himself saying. Just to see if she'd ask 
him to stay. 

Her throat bobbed, and she shook her head, her black hair flowing. "It'd 
be no use." 

"Maps are always useful." 

"Not if you can't read." 

Lorcan blinked, wondering if he'd heard her right. But color stained her 
pale cheeks, and that was indeed shame and despair clouding her dark eyes. 
"But you ..." There had been no opportunity for it these weeks, he realized 
--no chance where she might have revealed it. 

"I learned my letters, but when--when everything happened," she said, 
"and I was put in that tower ... My nursemaid was illiterate. So I never 
learned more. So I forgot what I did know." 

He wondered if he would have ever noticed if she hadn't told him. "You 
seem to have survived rather impressively without it." 

He spoke without considering, but it seemed to be the right thing to say. 
The corners of her mouth twitched upward. "I suppose I have," she mused. 

Lorcan's magic picked up on the garrison before he heard or scented 
them. 

It slithered along their swords--rudimentary, half-rusted weapons--and 
then bathed in their rising fear, excitement, perhaps even a tinge of 
bloodlust. 

Not good. Not when they were headed right to them. 

Lorcan closed the distance to Elide. "It seems our friends at the carnival 
wanted to make an easy silver coin." 

The helpless desperation on her face sharpened into wide-eyed 
alertness. "Guards are coming?" 

Lorcan nodded, the footsteps now close enough for him to count how 
many approached from the garrison in the heart of the town, no doubt 


meant to trap them between their swords and the river. If he were the 
betting sort, he'd gamble that the two bridges that spanned the river--ten 
blocks up on either side of them--were already full of guards. 

"You get a choice," he said. "Either I can end this matter here, and we 
can go back to the inn to learn if Nik and Ombriel wanted to get rid of us 
..." Her mouth tightened, and he knew her choice before he offered, "Or we 
can get on one of those barges and get the hell out right now." 

"The second," she breathed. 

"Good," was his only reply as he gripped her hand and tugged her 
forward. Even with his power supporting her leg, she was too slow-- 

"Just do it," she snapped. 

So Lorcan hauled her over a shoulder, freeing his hatchet with his other 
hand, and ran for the water. 





Elide bounced and slammed into Lorcan's broad shoulder, craning her head 
enough to watch the street behind them. No sign of guards, but ... that little 
voice who often whispered in her ear now tugged and begged her to go. To 
get out. 

"The gates at the city entrance,' she gasped as muscle and bone 
pummeled into her gut. "They'll be there, too." 

"Leave them to me." 

Elide tried not to imagine what that meant, but then they were at the 
docks, Lorcan sprinting for a barge, thundering down the steps of the quay 
and onto the long wooden dock. The barge was smaller than the others, its 
one-room chamber in the center painted bright green. Empty--aside from a 
few boxes of cargo on its prow. 

Lorcan pocketed the axe he'd thumbed free, and Elide gripped his 
shoulder, fingers digging into muscle, as he set her over the high lip of the 
barge and onto the wooden planks. She stumbled a step as her legs adjusted 
to the bobbing of the river, but-- 

Lorcan was already whirling toward the reed-slim man who barreled 
toward them, a knife out. "That's my boat," he bleated. He realized who, 
exactly, he would be fighting as he cleared the short wooden ladder onto the 


dock and took in Lorcan's size, the hatchet and sword now in the wartrior's 
broad hands, and the expression of death surely on his face. 

Lorcan said simply, "It's our boat now." 

The man glanced between them. "You--you won't clear the bridges or 
the city walls--" 

Moments. They had only moments before the guards came-- 

Lorcan said to the man, "Get in. Now." 

The man began backing away. 

Elide braced her hand on the broad, raised side of the boat and said 
calmly, "He will kill you before you clear the ladder. Get us out of the city, 
and I swear you'll be set free once we're clear." 

"You'll slit my throat then, as good as you will now," the man said, 
gulping in air. 

Indeed, Lorcan's hatchet bobbed in that way she'd learned meant he 
was about to throw it. 

"T would ask you to reconsider," Elide said. 

Lorcan's wrist twitched ever so slightly. He'd do it--he'd kill this 
innocent man, just to get them free-- 

The man's knife drooped, then vanished into the sheath at his side. 
"There's a bend in the river past the town. Drop me off there." 

That was all Elide needed to hear as the man rushed toward them, 
untying lines and leaping into the boat with the ease of someone who'd 
done it a thousand times. He and Lorcan grabbed the poles to push out into 
the river, and as soon as they were loose, Lorcan hissed, "If you betray us, 
you'll be dead before the guards can even board." The man nodded, now 
steering them toward the eastern exit of the town, as Lorcan dragged her 
into the one-room cabin. 

The cabin interior was lined with windows, all clean enough to suggest 
the man took some pride in his boat. Lorcan half shoved her under a table in 
its center, the embroidered cloth covering it shielding her from anything but 
sounds: Lorcan's footsteps going silent, though she could feel him taking up 
a hiding place to monitor the proceedings from within the cabin; the patter 
of rain on the flat roof; the thud of the pole as it occasionally knocked into 
the side of the barge. 

Her body soon ached from holding herself still and quiet. 


Was this to be her life for the foreseeable future? Hunted and hounded 
across the world? 

And finding Aelin ... How would she ever do that? She could go back 
to Terrasen, but she didn't know who ruled from Orynth. If Aelin had not 
taken back her throne ... Perhaps it was an unspoken message that danger 
lay there. That all was not well in Terrasen. 

But to go to Eyllwe on a bit of speculation ... Of all the rumors Elide 
had listened to in the past two hours, that captain's reasons had been the 
wisest. 

The world seemed to still with some unspoken tension, a ripple of fear. 

But then the man's voice was calling out again, and metal groaned--a 
gate. The city gates. 

She stayed under the table, counting her breaths, thinking through all 
that she'd heard. She doubted the carnival would miss them. 

And she'd bet all the money in her boot that Nik and Ombriel had been 
the ones who'd set the guards on them, deciding she and Lorcan were too 
much of a threat--especially with the ilken hunting her. She wondered if 
Molly had known all along, from that very first meeting, that they were liars 
and had let Nik and Ombriel sell them out when the bounty was too good to 
pass up, the cost of loyalty too great. 

Elide sighed through her nose. A splash sounded, but the boat ambled 
onward. 

At least she'd taken the little bit of stone with her, though she'd miss 
her clothes, shabby as they were. These leathers were growing stuffy in the 
oppressive heat, and if she were to go to Eyllwe, they'd be sweltering-- 

Lorcan's footsteps sounded. "Get out." 

Wincing as her ankle barked in pain, she crawled from under the table 
and peered around. "No trouble?" 

He shook his head. He was splattered with rain or river water. She 
peered around him to where the man had been steering the boat. No one 
there--or in the rear of the boat. 

"He swam to shore back at the bend," Lorcan explained. 

Elide loosed a breath. "He might very well run to town and tell them. It 
won't take long for them to catch up." 

"We'll deal with it," Lorcan said, turning away. Too fast. He avoided 
her eyes too fast-- 


She took in the water, the stains now on the sleeves of his shirt. Like ... 
like he'd washed his hands quickly, sloppily. 

She glanced at the hatchet at his side as he strode out of the cabin. "You 
killed him, didn't you?" That was what the splash had been. A body being 
dumped over the side. 

Lorcan halted. Looked over a broad shoulder. There was nothing human 
in his dark eyes. "If you want to survive, you have to be willing to do what 
is necessary." 

"He might have had a family depending on him." She'd seen no 
wedding ring, but it didn't mean anything. 

"Nik and Ombriel didn't give us that consideration when they reported 
us to the garrison." He stalked onto the deck, and she stormed after him. 
Lush trees lined the river, a living shield around them. 

And there--there was a stain on the planks, shining and dark. Her 
stomach rose. 

"You planned to lie to me about it," she seethed. "But how would you 
explain that?" 

A shrug. Lorcan took up the pole and moved with fluid grace to the side 
of the barge, where he pushed them away from an approaching sandbank. 

He had killed that man-- "I swore to him he'd be set free." 

"You swore it, not me." 

Her fingers curled into fists. And that thing--that stone--wrapped in 
that bit of cloth inside her jacket began to stir. 

Lorcan stilled, the pole gripped tight in his hands. "What is that," he 
said too softly. 

She held her ground. Like hell she'd back down from him, like hell 
she'd allow him to intimidate her, overrule her, kill people so they could 
escape-- 

"What. Is. That." 

She refused to speak, to even touch the lump in her pocket. It thrummed 
and grumbled, a beast opening an eye, but she didn't dare to reach out, to so 
much as acknowledge that strange, otherworldly presence. 

Lorcan's eyes widened slightly, then he was setting down the pole and 
stalking across the deck and into the cabin. She lingered by the edge, unsure 
whether to follow or perhaps jump into the water and swim to shore, but-- 





There was a thud of metal on metal, as if something was being cracked 
open, and then-- 

Lorcan's roar shook the boat, the river, the trees. Long-legged river 
birds hauled themselves into flight. 

Then Lorcan flung open the door, so violently it nearly ripped off its 
hinges, and hurled what looked to be the shards of a broken amulet into the 
river. Or he tried to. Lorcan threw it hard enough that it cleared the river 
entirely and slammed into a tree, gouging out a chunk of wood. 

He whirled, and Elide's anger stumbled a step at the blistering wrath 
twisting his features. He prowled for her, grabbing the pole as if to keep 
from throttling her, and said, "What is it that you carry?" 

And the demand, the violence and entitlement and arrogance, had her 
seeing red, too. So Elide said with quiet venom, "Why don't you just slit 
my throat and find out for yourself?" 

Lorcan's nostrils flared. "If you have a problem with my killing 
someone who reeked of itching to betray us the moment he got the chance, 
then you are going to love your queen." 

For a while now, he'd hinted that he knew of her, that he knew of her 
well enough to call her horrible things, but-- "What do you mean?" 

Lorcan, gods above, looked as if his temper had at last slipped its leash 
as he said, "Celaena Sardothien is a nineteen-year-old assassin--who calls 
herself the best in the world." A snort. "She killed and reveled and shopped 
her way through life and never once apologized for it. She gloried in it. And 
then this spring, one of my sentinels, Prince Rowan Whitethorn, was tasked 
to deal with her when she washed up on Wendlyn's shores. Turns out, he 
fell in love with her instead, and she with him. Turns out, whatever they 
were doing up in the Cambrian Mountains got her to stop calling herself 
Celaena and start going by her true name again." A brutal smile. "Aelin 
Galathynius." 

Elide could barely feel her body. "What?" was about the only word she 
could manage. 

"Your fire-breathing queen? She's a gods-damned assassin. Trained to 
be a killer from the moment your mother died defending her. Trained to be 
no better than the man who butchered your mother and your royal family." 

Elide shook her head, her hands slackening. "What?" she said again. 


Lorcan laughed mirthlessly. "While you were locked in that tower for 
ten years, she was indulging in the riches of Rifthold, spoiled and coddled 
by her master--the King of the Assassins--whom she murdered in cold 
blood this spring. So you'll find that your long-lost savior is little better 
than I am. Yov'll find that she would have killed that man the same as I did, 
and would have as little tolerance for your whining as I do." 

Aelin ... an assassin. Aelin--the same person she'd been tasked to give 
the stone to ... 

"You knew," she said. "This whole time we've been together--you 
knew I was looking for the same person." 

"I told you that to find one would be to find the other." 

"You Anew, and you didn't tell me. Why?" 

"You still haven't told me your secrets. I don't see why I should tell all 
of mine, either." 

She squeezed her eyes shut, trying to ignore the dark stain on the wood 
--trying to soothe the sting of his words and seal the hole that had opened 
beneath her feet. What had been in that amulet? Why had he roared and-- 

"Your little queen," Lorcan sneered, "is a murderer, and a thief, and a 
liar. So if you're going to call me such things, then be prepared to fling 
them at her, too." 

Her skin was too tight, her bones too brittle to bear the anger that took 
control. She scrambled for the right words to hurt him, wound him, as if 
they were fistfuls of rocks that she could hurl at Lorcan's head. 

Elide hissed, "I was wrong. I said you and I were the same--that we 
had no family, no friends. But I have none because land and circumstance 
separate me from them. You have none because no one can stomach being 
around you." She tried--and succeeded, if the ire that rippled in his eyes 
was any indication--to look down her nose at him, even with him towering 
over her. "And you know what is the biggest lie you tell everyone, Lorcan? 
It's that you prefer it that way. But what I hear, when you rant about my 
bitch-queen? All I hear are the words of someone who is deeply, deeply 
jealous, and lonely, and pathetic. All I hear are the words of someone who 
saw Aelin and Prince Rowan fall in love and resented them for their 
happiness--because you are so unhappy." She couldn't stop the words once 
they started flinging out. "So call Aelin a murderer and a thief and a liar. 
Call her a bitch-queen and a fire-breather. But forgive me if I take it upon 


myself to be the judge of those things when I meet her. Which I will do." 
She pointed to the muddy gray river flowing around them. "I'm going to 
Eyllwe. Take me ashore and I'Il wash my hands of you as easily as you 
washed the blood of that man off yours." 

Lorcan looked her over, teeth bared enough to show those slightly 
elongated canines. But she didn't care about his Fae heritage, or his age, or 
his ability to kill. 

After a moment, he went back to pushing the pole against the river 
bottom--not to bring them to shore, but to guide them along. 

"Did you not hear what I said? Take me to shore." 

"No." 

Her rage overcame any sort of common sense, any warning from 
Anneith as she stormed over to him. "No? " 

He let the pole drag in the water and turned his face to her. No emotion 
--not even anger lingered there. "The river veered southward two miles 
ago. From the map in the cabin, we can take it straight south, then find the 
fastest route to Banjali." She wiped the rain from her dripping brow as 
Lorcan brought his face close enough for them to share breath. "Turns out, I 
now have business with Aelin Galathynius, too. Congratulations, Lady. You 
just got yourself a guide to Eyllwe." 

A cold, killing light was in his eyes, and she wondered what the hell 
he'd roared about. 

But those eyes dipped to her mouth, clamped tight in her rage. And a 
part of her that had nothing to do with fear went still at the attention, even 
as other parts went a bit molten. 

Lorcan's eyes at last found her own, and his voice was a midnight growl 
as he said, "As far as anyone's concerned, you're still my wife." 

Elide didn't object--even as she walked back into the cabin, his 
insufferable magic helping with her limp, and slammed the door shut so 
hard the glass rattled. 


Storm clouds drifted away to reveal a star-flecked night and a moon bright 
enough for Lorcan to navigate the narrow, sleepy river. 


He steered them hour after hour, contemplating precisely how he was 
going to murder Aelin Galathynius without Elide or Whitethorn getting in 
the way, and then how he was going to slice up her corpse and feed it to the 
crows. 

She had lied to him. She and Whitethorn had tricked him that day the 
prince had handed over the Wyrdkey. 

There'd been nothing inside the amulet but one of those rings--an 
utterly useless Wyrdstone ring, wrapped in a bit of parchment. And on it 
was written in a feminine scrawl: 


Heres hoping you discover more creative terms than "bitch" to call me when you find 
this. 
With all my love, 
A.A.G. 


He'd kill her. Slowly. Creatively. He'd been forced to swear a blood 
promise that Mala's ring truly offered immunity from the Valg when it was 
worn--he hadn't thought to demand that their Wyrdkey was real, too. 

And Elide--what Elide carried, what had made him realize it ... He'd 
think about that later. Contemplate what to do with the Lady of Perranth 
later. 

His only consolation was that he'd stolen Mala's ring back, but the little 
bitch still had the key. And if Elide needed to go to Aelin anyway ... Oh, 
he'd find Aelin for Elide. 

And he'd make the Queen of Terrasen crawl before the end of it. 


Chapter 44


The world began and ended in fire. 

A sea of fire with no room for air, for sound beyond the cascading 
molten earth. The true heart of fire--the tool of creation and destruction. 
And she was drowning in it. 

Its weight smothered her as she thrashed, seeking a surface or a bottom 
to push off from. Neither existed. 

As it flooded her throat, surging into her body and melting her apart, she 
began screaming noiselessly, begging it to halt-- 

Aelin. 

The name, roared into the core of flame at the heart of the world, was a 
beacon, a summons. She'd been born waiting to hear that voice, had blindly 
sought it her whole life, would follow it unto the ending of all things-- 

"AELIN." 

Aelin bowed off the bed, flame in her mouth, her throat, her eyes. Real 
flame. 

Golds and blues wove among simmering swaths of reds. Real flame, 
erupting from her, the sheets scorched, the room and the rest of the bed 
spared from incineration, the ship in the middle of the sea spared from 
incineration, by an uncompromising, unbreakable wall of air. 

Hands wrapped in ice squeezed her shoulders, and through the flame, 
Rowan's snarling face appeared, commanding her to breathe-- 

She took a breath. More flame rushed down her throat. 

There was no tether, no leash to bring her magic to heel. Oh, gods--oh, 
gods, she couldn't even feel a burnout threatening nearby. There was 
nothing but this flame-- 

Rowan gripped her face in his hands, steam rippling where his ice and 
wind met her fire. "You are its master; you control it. Your fear grants it the 
right to take over." 


Her body arced off the mattress again, utterly naked. She must have 
burned her clothes--Rowan's favorite shirt. Her flames burned wilder. 

He gripped her hard, forcing her to meet his eyes as he snarled, "I see 
you. I see every part of you. And I am not afraid." 

I will not be afraid. 

A line in the burning brightness. 

My name is Aelin Ashryver Galathynius ... 

And I will not be afraid. 

As surely as if she grabbed it in her hand, the leash appeared. 

Darkness flowed in, blessed and calm where that burning pit of flame 
had raged. 

She swallowed once, twice. "Rowan." 

His eyes gleamed with near-animal brightness, scanning every inch of 
her. 

His heartbeat was rampant, thundering--panicked. "Rowan," she 
repeated. 

Still he did not move, did not stop staring at her, searching for signs of 
harm. Something in her own chest shifted at his panic. 

Aelin grasped his shoulder, digging in her nails at the violence rampant 
on every line of his body, as if he'd loosed whatever leashes he kept on 
himself in anticipation of fighting to keep her in this body and not some 
goddess or worse. "Calm down. Now." 

He did no such thing. Rolling her eyes, she tugged his hands from her 
face to lean over and throw the sheets off them. "I am fine," she said, 
enunciating each word. "You saw to that. Now, get me some water. I'm 
thirsty." 

A basic, easy command. To serve, in the way he'd explained that Fae 
males liked to be needed, to fulfill some part of them that wanted to fuss 
and dote. To drag him back up to that level of civilization and reason. 

Rowan's face was still harsh with feral wrath--and the insidious terror 
running beneath it. 

So Aelin leaned in, nipped his jaw, making sure her canines scratched, 
and said onto his skin, "If you don't start acting like a prince, you can sleep 
on the floor." 

Rowan pulled back, his savage face not wholly of this world, but 
slowly, as if the words sank in, his features softened. He was still looking 


pissy, but not so near killing that invisible threat against her, as he leaned in, 
nipping her jaw in return, and said into her ear, "I'm going to make you 
regret using such threats, Princess." 

Oh, gods. Her toes curled, but she gave him a simpering smile as he 
rose to his feet, every muscle in his naked body rippling with the 
movement, and watched him pad with feline grace to the washstand and 
ewer atop it. 

The bastard had the nerve to look her over as he lifted the jug. And then 
give her a satisfied, male smile as he poured a glass right to the brim, 
halting with expert precision. 

She debated sending a lick of flame to burn his bare ass as he set down 
the jug with emphasized care and calm. And then stalked back to the bed, 
eyes on her every step of the way, and set the water on the small table 
beside it. 

Aelin rose on surprisingly steady knees and faced him. 

Only the creaking of the ship and hissing of the waves against it filled 
the room. 

"What was that?" she asked quietly. 

His eyes shuttered. "It was ... me losing control." 

"Why?" 

He glanced at the porthole and moon-kissed sea beyond. So rare for him 
to avoid her stare. 

"Why?" she pushed. 

Rowan at last met her gaze. "I didn't know if she'd taken you again." 
No matter that the Wyrdkey now lay beside the bed and not around her 
neck. "Even when I realized you were just in the magic's thrall, I still ... 
The magic took you away. It's been a long time since I wasn't certain ... 
since I didn't know how to get you back." He bared his teeth, loosing a 
jagged breath, the wrath now directed inward. "Before you call me a 
territorial Fae bastard, allow me to apologize and explain that it is very 
difficult--" 

"Rowan." He stilled. She crossed the small lingering distance between 
them, every step like the answer to some question she'd asked from the 
moment her soul had sparked into existence. "You are not human. I do not 
expect you to be." 


He almost seemed to recoil. But she put a hand on his bare chest, over 
his heart. It still thundered beneath her palm. 

She said softly, feeling that heart beneath her hand, "I do not care if you 
are Fae, or human, if you are Valg or a gods-damned skinwalker. You are 
what you are. And what I want ... what I need, Rowan, is someone who 
does not apologize for it. For who they are. You have never once done so." 
She leaned forward to kiss the bare skin where her hand had been. "Please 
don't start doing it now. Yes, sometimes you piss me the hell off with that 
Fae territorial nonsense, but ... I heard your voice. It woke me up. It led me 
out of that ... place." 

He bowed his head until his brow leaned against hers. "I wish I had 
more to offer you--during this war, and beyond it." 

She slid her arms around his bare waist. "You offer me more than I ever 
hoped for." He seemed to object, but she said, "And I figured since both 
Darrow and Rolfe informed me I needed to sell my hand in marriage for the 
sake of this war, I should do the opposite." 

A snort. "Typical. But if Terrasen needs--" 

"Here is the way I see it," she said, pulling back to examine his harsh 
face. "We do not have the luxury of time. And a marriage to a foreign 
kingdom, with its contracts and distances, plus the months it takes to raise 
and send an army ... we do not have that time. We only have now. And 
what I don't need is a husband who will try to get into a pissing contest with 
me, or who PII have to cloister somewhere for his own safety, or who will 
hide in a corner when I wake up with flames all around me." She kissed his 
tattooed chest again, right over that mighty, thundering heart. "This, Rowan 
--this is all I need. Just this." 

The reverberations of his deep, rattling breath echoed into her cheek, 
and he stroked a hand over her hair, along her bare back. Lower. "A court 
that can change the world." 

She kissed the corner of his mouth. "We'll find a way--together." The 
words he'd given her once, the words that had begun the healing of her 
shattered heart. And his own. "Did I hurt--" Her words were a rasp. 

"No." He brushed a thumb over her cheekbone. "No, you didn't hurt 
me. Or anything else." 

Something in her chest caved in, and Rowan gathered her in his arms as 
she buried her face in his neck. His calloused hands caressed her back, over 


each and every scar and the tattoos he'd inked on her. 

"If we survive this war," she murmured after a while onto his bare chest, 
"you and I are going to have to learn how to relax. To sleep through the 
night." 

"If we survive this war, Princess," he said, running a finger down the 
groove of her spine, "Ill be happy to do anything you want. Even learn 
how to relax." 

"And if we never have a moment's peace, even after we get the Lock, 
the keys, and send Erawan back to his hellhole realm?" 

The amusement faded, replaced by something more intent as his fingers 
stilled on her back. "Even if we have threats of war every other day, even if 
we have to host fussy emissaries, even if we have to visit god-awful 
kingdoms and play nice, I'Il be happy to do it, if you're at my side." 

Her lips trembled. "Och, you. Since when did you learn to make such 
pretty speeches?" 

"I just needed the right excuse to learn," he said, kissing her cheek. 

Her body went taut and molten in all the right places as his mouth 
moved lower, pressing gentle, biting kisses to her jaw, her ear, her neck. She 
dug her fingers into his back, baring her throat as his canines scratched 
lightly. 

"I love you," Rowan breathed onto her skin, and flicked his tongue over 
the spot where his canines had scratched. "I'd walk into the burning heart of 
hell itself to find you." 

He almost had mere minutes ago, she wanted to say. But Aelin only 
arched her back a bit more, a small, needy noise coming out of her. This-- 
him ... Would it ever stop--the wanting? The need to not only be near him, 
but to have him so deep in her she felt their souls twining, their magic 
dancing ... The tether that had led her out of that burning core of madness 
and destruction. 

"Please," she breathed, nails digging into his lower back in emphasis. 

Rowan's low groan was his only answer as he hoisted her up. She 
wrapped her legs around his waist, letting him carry her not to the bed, but 
to the wall, and the sensation of the cool wood against her back, compared 
to the heat and hardness of him pushing into her front-- 

Aelin panted through her gritted teeth as he again dragged his tongue 
over that spot on her neck. "Please." 


She felt his smile against her skin as Rowan thrust into her in a long, 
powerful stroke--and bit down on her neck. 

A claiming, mighty and true, that she understood he so desperately 
needed. That she needed, and with his teeth in her, his body in her ... She 
was going to combust, she was going to splinter apart from the 
overwhelming need-- 

Rowan's hips began to move, setting a lazy, smooth pace as he kept his 
canines buried in her neck. As his tongue slid along the twin points of 
pleasure edged with finest pain, and he tasted her very essence as if it were 
wine. 

He laughed, low and wicked, as release had her biting down on his 
shoulder to keep from screaming loud enough to wake the creatures 
sleeping on the bottom of the sea. 

When Rowan finally drew his mouth away from her neck, his magic 
healing the small holes he'd left, his hands tightened on her thighs, pinning 
her to the wall as he moved deeper, harder. 

Aelin only dragged her fingers through his hair as she gave him a 
savage kiss, and tasted her own blood on his tongue. 

She whispered onto his mouth, "Pll always find a way back to you." 

This time, when Aelin went over the edge, Rowan plummeted with her. 


Manon Blackbeak awoke. 

There had been no sound, no smell, no hint of why she'd awoken, but 
those predatory instincts had sensed something amiss and sent her tumbling 
from sleep. 

She blinked as she sat up, her wound now a dull ache--and found her 
head clear of whatever that haze had been. 

The room was near-black, save for the moonlight that trickled through 
the porthole to illuminate her cramped cabin. How long had she been lost to 
sleep and hideous melancholy? 

She listened carefully to the creaking of the ship. A faint grumbling 
sounded from above--Abraxos. Still alive. Still--sleeping, if she knew that 
drowsy, wheezing grumble. 


She tested the manacles on her wrists, lifting them to peer at the lock. A 
clever sort of contraption, the chains thick and anchored soundly into the 
wall. Her ankles were no better. 

She couldn't remember the last time she'd been in chains. How had 
Elide endured it for a decade? 

Maybe she'd find the girl once she got out of here. She doubted the 
Havilliard king had any news of the Thirteen anyway. She'd sneak onto 
Abraxos's back, fly for the coast, and find Elide before tracking down her 
coven. And then ... she didn't know what she'd do. But it was better than 
lying here like a worm in the sun, letting whatever despair had seized 
control these days or weeks wreak havoc on her. 

But as if she'd summoned him, the door opened. 

Dorian stood there, a candle in his-- 

Not a candle. Pure flame wreathed his fingers. It set his sapphire eyes 
glowing bright as he found her lucid. "Was it you--who sent that ripple of 
power?" 

"No." Though it didn't take much guessing to suspect who it'd been, 
then. "Witches don't have magic like that." 

He angled his head, his blue-black hair stained gold by his flames. "But 
you're long-lived." 

She nodded, and he took that as an invitation to slide into his usual 
chair. "It's called the Yielding," she said, a chill brushing down her spine. 
"The bit of magic we have. We usually cannot summon or wield, but for 
one moment in a witch's life, she can summon great power to unleash upon 
her enemies. The cost is that she is incinerated in the blast, her body yielded 
to the Darkness. In the witch wars, witches on both sides made Yieldings 
during every battle and skirmish." 

"It's suicide--to blow yourself into smithereens ... and take enemies 
with you." 

"It is, and it's not pretty. As the Ironteeth witch yields life to the 
Darkness, its power fills her, and unleashes from her in an ebony wave. A 
manifestation of what lies in our souls." 

"Have you seen it done?" 

"Once. By a scared young witch who knew she wouldn't win glory any 
other way. Only, she took out half our Ironteeth force as well as the 
Crochans." 


Her mind snagged on the word. Crochans. Her people-- 

Not her people. She was a gods-damned Blackbeak-- 

"Will the Ironteeth use it on us?" 

"If you're facing lower-level covens, yes. Older covens are too arrogant, 
too skilled to choose the Yielding instead of fighting their way out. But 
younger, weaker covens get spooked, or wish to win valor through 
sacrifice." 

"It's murder." 

"It's war. War is sanctioned murder, no matter what side you're on." Ire 
flickered on his face, and she asked, "Have you ever killed a man?" 

He opened his mouth to say no, but the light in his hand died. 

He had. When he'd been collared, she guessed. The Valg inside him had 
done it. Multiple times. And not cleanly. 

"Remember what they made you do,' Manon said, "when you face 
them again." 

"I doubt Pll ever forget it, witchling." He stood, heading for the door. 

Manon said, "These chains are rubbing my skin raw. Surely you've 
some sympathy for chained things." Dorian paused. She lifted her hands, 
displaying the chains. "PI give my word not to do any harm." 

"It's not my call. Now that you're talking again, maybe telling Aelin 
what she's been pushing you about will get you on her good side." 

Manon had no idea what the queen had been demanding of her. None. 
"The longer I stay in here, princeling, the more likely I am to do something 
stupid when you release me. Let me at least feel the wind on my face." 

"You've got a window. Go stand in front of it." 

Part of her sat up straight at the harshness, the ma/eness in that tone, in 
the set of those broad shoulders. She purred, "If I had been asleep, would 
you have lingered to stare at me for a while?" 

Icy amusement gleamed there. "Would you have objected?" 

And perhaps she was reckless and wild and still a bit stupid from blood 
loss, but she said, "If you plan to sneak in here in the darkest hours of the 
night, you should at least have the decency to ensure I get something out of 
it." 

His lips twitched, though the smile was cold and sensuous in a way that 
made her wonder what playing with a king blessed with raw magic might 
be like. If he'd make her beg for the first time in her long life. He looked 


capable of it--perhaps willing to let a little cruelty into the bedroom. Her 
blood thrummed. "As tempting as seeing you naked and chained might be 
... A soft lover's laugh. "I don't think you'd enjoy the loss of control." 

"And you've been with so many women to be able to judge a witch's 
wants so easily?" 

That smile turned lazy. "A gentleman never tells." 

"How many?" He was only twenty--though he was a prince, now a 
king. Women had likely been falling over themselves for him since his 
voice had deepened. 

"How many men have you been with?" he countered. 

She smirked. "Enough to know how to handle the needs of mortal 
princelings. To know what will make you beg." Never mind that she was 
contemplating the opposite. 

He drifted across the room, past the range of her chains, right into her 
own breathing space. He leaned over her, nearly nose-to-nose, nothing at all 
amused in his face, in the cut of his cruel, beautiful mouth, as he said, "I 
don't think you can handle the sort of things I need, witchling. And I am 
never begging for anything again in my life." 

And then he left. Manon stared after him, a hiss of rage slipping from 
her own lips. At the opportunity she hadn't taken to grab him, hold him 
hostage, and demand her freedom; at the arrogance in his assumption; at the 
heat that had gathered in her core and now throbbed insistently enough that 
she clamped her legs together. 

She had never been denied. Men had fallen to pieces, sometimes 
literally, to crawl into her bed. And she ... She didn't know what she would 
have done if he had taken up her offer, if she would have decided to learn 
what the king could do, exactly, with that beautiful mouth and toned body. 
A distraction--and an excuse to loathe herself even more, she supposed. 

She was still seething at the door when it opened again. 

Dorian leaned against the aged wood, his eyes still glazed in a way she 
couldn't tell was lust or hatred or both. He slid the lock shut without 
looking at it. 

Her heartbeat picked up, her entire immortal focus narrowed to his 
steady, unhurried breathing, the unreadable face. 

His voice was rough as he said, "I won't waste my breath telling you 
how stupid it would be to try to take me hostage." 


"I won't waste mine telling you to take only what I offer you and 
nothing more." 

Her ears strained to listen, but even his damned heart was a solid beat. 
Not a whiff of fear. He said, "I need to hear you say yes." His eyes flicked 
to the chains. 

It took her a moment to comprehend, but she let out a low laugh. "So 
considerate, princeling. But yes. I do this of my own free will. It can be our 
little secret." 

She was nothing and no one now anyway. Sharing a bed with her enemy 
was nothing compared to the Crochan blood that flowed in her veins. 

She began to unbutton the white shirt she'd been wearing for gods knew 
how long, but he growled, "PI do it myself." 

Like hell he would. She touched the second button. 

Invisible hands wrapped around her wrists, tightly enough that she 
dropped the shirt. 

Dorian prowled to her. "I said that I'd do it." Manon took in each inch 
of him as he towered over her, and a shiver of pleasure rippled through her. 
"I suggest you listen." 

The pure male arrogance in that statement alone-- 

"You're courting death if you--" 

Dorian lowered his mouth to hers. 

It was a featherlight graze, barely a whisper of touch. Intent, calculated, 
and so unexpected she arched into it a bit. 

He kissed the corner of her mouth with the same silken gentleness. Then 
the other corner. She didn't move, didn't even breathe--like every part of 
her body was waiting to see what he'd do next. 

But Dorian pulled back, studying her eyes with a cool detachment. 
Whatever he beheld there made him step away. 

The invisible fingers on her wrists vanished. The door unlatched. And 
that cocky grin returned as Dorian shrugged with one shoulder and said, 
"Maybe another night, witchling." 

Manon almost bellowed as he slipped out the door--and didn't return. 


Chapter 45 


The witch was lucid but pissed off. 

Aedion had the pleasure of serving her breakfast and tried not to note 
the lingering scent of female arousal in the cabin, or that Dorian's scent was 
entwined among it. 

The king was entitled to move on, Aedion reminded himself hours later 
as he scanned the late afternoon horizon from the ship's helm. In the quiet 
hours of his watches, he'd often mulled over the thorough scolding 
Lysandra had given him regarding his anger and cruelty toward the king. 
And maybe--just maybe--Lysandra was right. And maybe the fact that 
Dorian could even look at a female with interest after seeing Sorscha 
beheaded was a miracle. But ... the witch? That was what he wanted to 
tangle with? 

He asked Lysandra as much when she joined him thirty minutes later, 
still soaked from patrolling the waters ahead. All clear. 

Lysandra finger-combed her inky sheet of hair, frowning. "I had clients 
who lost their wives or lovers, and wanted something to distract them. 
Wanted the opposite of who their beloved had been, perhaps to make the act 
feel wholly separate. What he went through would change anyone. He 
might very well find himself now attracted to dangerous things." 

"He already had a penchant for them," Aedion murmured, glancing to 
where Aelin and Rowan sparred on the main deck, sweat gleaming golden 
as the afternoon light shifted toward evening. Dorian perched on the nearby 
steps up to the quarterdeck, Damaris braced over his knees, half awake in 
the heat. Part of Aedion smiled, knowing Rowan would no doubt kick his 
ass for it. 

"Aelin was dangerous, but still human," Lysandra observed. "Manon is 
... not. He probably likes it that way. And I'd stay out of it if I were you." 


"I'm not getting in the middle of that disaster, don't worry. Though I 
wouldn't let those iron teeth near my favorite part if I were him." Aedion 
grinned as Lysandra tipped her head back and laughed. He added, "Besides, 
watching Aelin and the witch go head-to-head this morning about Elide was 
enough to remind me to stay the hell back and enjoy the spectacle." 

Little Elide Lochan--alive and out there, searching for them. Gods 
above. The look on Aelin's face when Manon had revealed detail after 
detail, what Vernon had tried to do to the girl ... 

There would be a reckoning in Perranth for that. Aedion himself would 
hang the lord by his intestines. While Vernon was still breathing. And then 
he'd get started on paying Vernon back for the ten years of horror Elide had 
endured. For the maimed foot and the chains. For the tower. 

Locked in a tower--in a city he'd visited so many times in the past ten 
years he had no count. She might have even watched the Bane from that 
spire as they came and left the city. Possibly thinking he'd forgotten or 
didn't care about her, either. 

And now she was out there. Alone. 

With a permanently mangled foot, no training, and no weapons. If she 
was lucky, perhaps she'd run into the Bane first. His commanders would 
recognize her name, protect her. That is, if she dared to reveal herself at all. 

It had taken all his self-control not to strangle Manon for abandoning 
the girl in the middle of Oakwald, for not flying her right to Terrasen. 

Aelin, however, hadn't bothered with restraint. 

Two strikes, both so fast even the Wing Leader didn't see them. 

A backhanded blow to Manon's face. For leaving Elide. 

And then a ring of fire around Manon's throat, slamming her into the 
wood, as Aelin made her swear the information was correct. 

Rowan had drily reminded Aelin that Manon was responsible for 
Elide's escape and rescue, too. Aelin had merely said if Manon hadn't been, 
the fire would already be down her throat. 

And that was that. 

Aelin, from the fervor with which she sparred with Rowan across the 
deck, was still pissed. 

The witch, from the snarling and scent in her cabin, was still pissed. 

Aedion was more than ready to get to the Stone Marshes--even if what 
awaited them there might not be so pleasant. 


Three more days lay between them and the eastern coast. And then ... 
then they'd all see how much Rolfe's alliance was worth, if the man could 
be trusted. 

"You can't avoid him forever, you know," Lysandra said, drawing his 
attention to the other reason he needed to get off this ship. 

His father sat near where Abraxos had curled along the prow, guarding 
and observing the wyvern. Learning how to kill them--where to strike. 

No matter that the wyvern was little more than an oversized hound, 
docile enough that they hadn't bothered to chain him. They had none big 
enough anyway, and the beast would likely refuse to leave this ship until 
Manon did. Abraxos only moved to hunt for fish or larger game, Lysandra 
escorting him in sea dragon form beneath the waves. And when the beast 
was sprawled on the deck ... the Lion kept him company. 

Aedion had barely spoken to Gavriel since Skull's Bay. 

"T'm not avoiding him," Aedion said. "I just have no interest in talking 
to him." 

Lysandra flipped her wet hair over a shoulder, frowning at the damp 
splotches on her white shirt. "I, for one, would like to hear the story of how 
he crossed paths with your mother. He's kind--for one of Maeve's cadre. 
Better than Fenrys." 

Indeed, Fenrys made Aedion want to shatter things. That laughing face, 
the swaggering, dark arrogance ... It was another mirror, he realized. But 
one who tracked Aelin everywhere like some dog. Or wolf, he supposed. 

Aedion hadn't pitted himself against the male in the sparring ring, but 
he'd carefully watched Fenrys take on Rowan and Gavriel, both of whom 
had trained the male. Fenrys fought as he'd expect a warrior with centuries 
of training by two lethal killers to fight. But he had not glimpsed another 
whisper of the magic that allowed Fenrys to leap between places as if 
walking through some invisible doorway. 

As if his thoughts summoned the immortal warrior, Fenrys swaggered 
out from the shadows below deck and smirked at them all before taking up 
his sentry position near the foremast. They were all on a schedule of 
watches and patrols, Lysandra and Rowan usually tasked with flying far out 
of sight to survey behind and ahead or communicate with the two escort 
ships. Aedion hadn't dared tell the shifter that he often counted the minutes 


until she returned, that his chest always felt unbearably tight until he spotted 
whatever winged or finned form she wore returning to them. 

Like his cousin, he had no doubt the shifter wouldn't take well to his 
fussing. 

Lysandra was carefully watching Aelin and Rowan, their blades like 
quicksilver, as they met each other blow for blow. "You've been doing well 
with your lessons," Aedion told the shifter. 

Lysandra's green eyes crinkled. They'd all been taking turns walking 
the shifter through handling various weapons and hand-to-hand combat. 
Lysandra knew some from her time with Arobynn--he'd taught her as a 
way of ensuring the survival of his investment, she'd told him. 

But she wanted to know more. How to kill men in a myriad of ways. It 
shouldn't have thrilled him as much as it had. Not when she'd laughed off 
the claim Aedion had made on the beach that day in Skull's Bay. She hadn't 
mentioned it again. He hadn't been stupid enough to, either. 

Aedion trailed Lysandra, unable to help it, as she drifted toward where 
the queen and prince sparred, Dorian scooting over on the steps to silently 
offer her a space. Aedion marked the gesture and the king's respect, shoving 
aside his own warring feelings about it as he lingered above them, and 
focused on his cousin and Rowan. 

But they'd worked themselves into an impasse--enough so that Rowan 
called it off and sheathed his sword. Then flicked Aelin's nose when she 
looked pissy at not winning. Aedion laughed under his breath, glancing to 
the shifter as the queen and prince strode for the water jug and glasses 
against the stair railing and helped themselves. 

He was about to offer Lysandra a final round in the ring before the sun 
set when Dorian braced his arms on his knees and said to Aelin through the 
stair railing, "I don't think she'll do anything if we let her out." 

Aelin took a dainty sip of her water, still breathing hard. "Did you arrive 
at that conclusion before, during, or after you visited her in the middle of 
the night?" 

Oh, gods. It was going to be that sort of conversation. 

Dorian gave a half smile. "You have a preference for immortal warriors. 
Why can't I?" 

It was the faint click of her glass on the small table that made Aedion 
brace himself--treally start calculating the layout of the various decks. 


Fenrys still monitored them from the foremast, Lysandra remained on 
Dorian's other side. He supposed that, standing above Dorian on the stairs 
and Aelin beside them, he'd be right in the middle. 

Exactly where he'd sworn not to be. 

Rowan, on the other side of Aelin, said to Dorian, "Is there a reason, 
Majesty, that you believe the witch should be free?" 

Aelin shot him a look of pure flame. Good--let the prince deal with her 
wrath. Even days after the claiming that had left everyone pretending they 
didn't notice the two puncture wounds on Rowan's neck or the delicate, 
vicious scratches over his shoulders, the Fae Prince still looked like a male 
who had barely survived a storm and had enjoyed every wild second of it. 

Not to mention the twin wounds on Aelin's neck this morning. He'd 
almost begged her to find a scarf. 

"Why don't we lock one of you in a room"--Dorian pointed with his 
chin at the Fae warriors across the deck, at Lysandra to his right--"and see 
how well you fare after so much time." 

Aelin said, "Every inch of her has been designed to ensnare men. To 
make them think she's harmless." 

"Trust me, Manon Blackbeak is anything but harmless." 

Aelin charged on, "She and her kind are killers. They are raised without 
conscience. Regardless of what her grandmother did to her, she will always 
be that way. I will not endanger the lives of the people on this ship so you 
can sleep better at night." Her eyes shone with the unspoken jab. 

They all shifted, and Aedion was about to ask Lysandra to spar, 
conversation closed, when Dorian said a bit too quietly, "I am king, you 
know." 

Turquoise-and-gold eyes snapped to Dorian. Aedion could almost see 
the words Aelin fought to think through, her temper begging her to shut 
down the challenge. With a few choice sentences, she could fillet his spirit 
like a fish, further shredding the scraps of the man who remained after the 
Valg prince had violated him. And in doing so, lose a strong ally she'd need 
not just in this war, but if they survived it. And--those eyes softened a bit. 
A friend. She'd lose that, too. 

Aelin rubbed at the scars on her wrists, stark in the golden light of the 
setting sun. Ones that made Aedion sick to look at. She said to Dorian after 
a moment, "Controlled movements. If she leaves the room, she stays under 


guard--one of the Fae at any given time, plus one of us. Shackles on her 
wrists, not feet. No chains for the room, but a guard outside the door." 

Aedion caught the thumb Rowan brushed over one of those scars on her 
wrist. 

Dorian just said, "Fine." 

Aedion debated telling the king that a compromise from Aelin should be 
outright celebrated. 

Aelin's voice dropped to that lethal purr. "After you finished flirting 
with her that day in Oakwald, she and her coven tried to kill me." 

"You provoked her," Dorian countered. "And I sit here today because of 
what she risked when she came to Rifthold twice." 

Aelin wiped the sweat from her brow. "She has her own reasons, and I 
highly doubt it was because she, in her one hundred years of killing, 
decided your pretty face would turn her good." 

"Yours turned Rowan from three centuries of a blood oath." 

It was Aedion's father who said calmly as he left his perch near Abraxos 
on the prow to approach them, "I'd suggest, Majesty, that you pick another 
argument." 

Indeed, Aedion's every instinct came to attention at the frozen anger 
now limning the prince's every muscle. 

Dorian noticed it, too, and said, perhaps a bit guiltily, "I meant no 
offense, Rowan." 

Gavriel angled his head, golden hair sliding over his broad shoulder, 
and said with a ghost of a smile, "Don't worry, Majesty. Fenrys has given 
Whitethorn enough shit for it to last him another three centuries." 

Aedion blinked at the humor, the hint of a smile. 

But Aelin saved him the effort of deciding whether or not to answer that 
smile by saying to Dorian, "Well? Let's see if the Wing Leader would like 
to take a turn about the deck before dinner." 

Dorian was right to look wary, Aedion decided. But Aelin was already 
heading for the opposite side of the deck, Fenrys peeling off from his post 
by the foremast, that edged, bitter gaze sliding over them all while they 
passed. 

But Fenrys would follow, no doubt. Like hell would they unleash the 
witch without all of them there. Even the cadre seemed to understand that. 


So Aedion trailed after his queen into the dimness of the ship, night 
setting in above them, and prayed Aelin and Manon weren't about to rip the 
boat to shreds. 


Climbing into bed with a witch. Aelin ground her teeth as she headed for 
Manon's room. 

Dorian had once been notorious when it came to women, but this ... 
Aelin snorted, wishing Chaol were present, if only to see the look on his 
face. 

Even if it eased something tight in her chest to know Chaol and Faliq 
were in the South. Perhaps raising an army to cross the Narrow Sea and 
march northward. If they were all lucky. 

If. Aelin hated that word. But ... her friendship with Dorian was 
precarious enough. She'd yielded to his request partially out of some scrap 
of kindness, but mostly because she knew there was more Manon had to tell 
them about Morath. About Erawan. Lots more. 

And she doubted the witch would be forthcoming--especially when 
Aelin had lost her temper just a /ittle bit this morning. And maybe it made 
her a conniving, hideous person for using Dorian's interest as a veil to 
butter up the witch, but ... 1t was war. 

Aelin flexed her hand as she neared the witch's room, the lights swaying 
in the rougher waves they'd encountered since midday. 

Rowan had healed the bruise on the back of her knuckles from the blow 
she'd dealt the witch--and she'd thanked him by locking the door to their 
room and getting on her knees before him. She could still feel his fingers 
fisted in her hair, still hear his groan-- 

Rowan, now a step beside her, whipped his head in her direction. What 
the hell are you thinking about? 

But his pupils had flared enough that she was well aware he knew 
precisely where her mind had gone as they walked down to the witch's 
cabin. That Fenrys hung far back down the hall told her enough about the 
change in her scent. 

The usual things, she shot back at Rowan with a simpering smile. 
Killing, crocheting, how to make you emit those noises again-- 


Rowan's face took on a pained expression that had her grinning. 
Especially as his throat bobbed while he swallowed--hard. Round two, he 
seemed to say. As soon as this is dealt with. We're having round two. This 
time, I get to see what noises you make. 

Aelin nearly walked into the doorpost of Manon's open cabin. Rowan's 
low laugh made her focus, made her stop smiling like a lust-addled, 
lovesick idiot-- 

Manon was sitting upright in bed, golden eyes darting between Rowan 
and Dorian and her. 

Fenrys slid in behind them, his attention going right to the witch. No 
doubt stunned by the beauty, the grace, the blah-blah-blah perfectness of 
her. 

Manon said, low and flat, ""Who is this?" 

Dorian lifted a brow, following her gaze. "You've met him before. He's 
Fenrys--sworn warrior of Queen Maeve." 

It was the narrowing of Manon's eyes that had some instinct pricking. 
The flare of the witch's nostrils as she scented the male, his smell barely 
detectable in the cramped cabin-- 

"No, he's not," Manon said. 

The witch's iron nails flashed out a heartbeat before Fenrys struck. 


Chapter 46


It was still instinct to go for a knife before Aelin went for her magic. 

And as Fenrys leaped for Manon with a snarl, it was Rowan's power 
that sent him slamming through the room. 

Before the male had finished sliding across the floor, Aelin had a wall 
of flame up between them. "What the hell," she spat. 

On his knees, Fenrys clawed at his throat--at the air Rowan was 
choking off. 

The cabin was too small for them all to fit without getting too close. Ice 
danced at Dorian's fingertips as he slid beside Manon, still chained by the 
bed. 

"What did you mean, that's not Fenrys?" Aelin said to the witch without 
taking her eyes off him. Rowan let out a grunt behind her. 

And Aelin watched with a mix of horror and fascination as Fenrys's 
chest expanded in a mighty breath. As he got to his feet and surveyed that 
wall of flame. 

As if Rowan's magic had worn off. 

And as Fenrys's skin seemed to glow and melt away, as a creature as 
pale as fresh snow emerged from the vanishing illusion, Aelin gave Aedion 
a subtle look over her shoulder. 

Her cousin instantly moved, keys to Manon's chains appearing from his 
pocket. 

But Manon didn't move as the thing took form, all the spindly limbs, its 
wings tucked in tight; the hideous warped face sniffing them-- 

Manon's chains clanked free. 

Aelin said to the thing beyond her wall of flame, "What are you?" 

Manon answered for it. "Erawan's Bloodhound." 

The thing smiled, revealing rotted black stumps of teeth. "At your 
service," it said. She said, Aelin realized as she noted the small, shriveled 


breasts on its narrow chest. "So your guts stayed in," it purred to Manon. 

"Where is Fenrys?" Aelin demanded. 

The Bloodhound's smile didn't falter. "On patrol of the ship, on another 
level, I assume. Unaware, just as you were unaware, that one of your own 
wasn't truly with you while I--" 

"Ugh, another talker," Aelin said, flipping her braid over a shoulder. 
"Let me guess: you killed a sailor, took his place, learned what you needed 
to about how to get Manon off this ship and our patrols, and ... what? You 
planned to carry her off into the night?" Aelin frowned at the thing's thin 
body. "You look like you could barely lift a fork--and haven't in months." 

The Bloodhound blinked at her--then hissed. 

Manon let out a low laugh. 

Aelin said, "Honestly? You could have just snuck in here and saved 
yourself a thousand stupid steps--" 

"Shifter,' the thing hissed, hungrily enough that Aelin's words 
stumbled. 

Its enormous eyes had gone right to Lysandra, snarling softly in the 
corner in ghost leopard form. 

"Shifter," it hissed again, that longing twisting its features. 

And Aelin had a feeling she knew what this thing had begun as. What 
Erawan had trapped and mutilated in the mountains around Morath. 

"As I was saying," Aelin drawled as best she could, "you really brought 
this upon yourself--" 

"I came for the Blackbeak heir," the Bloodhound panted. "But look at 
you all: a trove worth your weight in gold." 

Its eyes went murky, as if it were no longer here, as if it had drifted into 
another room-- 

Shit. 

Aelin attacked with her flame. 

The Bloodhound screamed-- 

And Aelin's flame melted away into steam. 

Rowan was instantly there, shoving her back, sword out. Her magic-- 

"You should have given me the witch," the Bloodhound laughed, and 
ripped the porthole clean out of the side of the ship. "Now he knows who 
you travel with, what ship you sail ..." 


The creature lunged for the hole it had hewn in the side of the ship, 
spindrift misting in. 

A black-tipped arrow slammed into its knee, then another one. 

The Bloodhound went down an inch from freedom. 

Snarling as he stepped into the room, Fenrys fired another, pinning its 
shoulder into the wood planks. 

Apparently, he didn't take well to being impersonated. He gave Rowan 
a seething look that said as much. And that demanded how they all hadn't 
noticed the difference. 

But the Bloodhound wrenched herself up, black blood spraying the 
room, filling it with her reek. Aelin had a dagger angled, ready to fly; 
Manon was about to pounce; Rowan's hatchet was cocked-- 

The Bloodhound chucked a strap of black leather into the center of the 
room. 

Manon stopped dead. 

"Your Second screamed when Erawan broke her," the Bloodhound said. 
"His Dark Majesty sends this to remember her by." 

Aelin didn't dare take her eyes off the creature. But she could have 
sworn Manon swayed. 

And then the Bloodhound said to the witch, "A gift from a King of the 
Valg ... to the last living Crochan Queen." 


Manon stared and stared at that braided leather band--the one Asterin had 
worn every day, even when battle did not demand it--and did not care what 
the Bloodhound had declared to the others. Did not care if she was heir to 
the Blackbeak Witch-Clan or Queen of the Crochans. Did not care if-- 

Manon did not finish the thought over the roar that silenced everything 
in her head. 

The roar that came out of her mouth as she launched herself at the 
Bloodhound. 

The arrows through the beast scratched at Manon as she tackled that 
dewy, bony body into the wood. Claws and teeth slashed for her face, but 
Manon got her hands around that neck, and iron tore through damp skin. 


Then those claws were pinned in the wood beneath phantom hands as 
Dorian sauntered over, face so unyieldingly unmoved. The Bloodhound 
thrashed, those claws trying to wrench free-- 

The creature screamed as those invisible hands crunched down on bone. 

Then through it. 

Manon gaped at the severed hands a moment before the Bloodhound 
screamed, so loud her own ears rang. But Dorian crooned, "Be done with 
it." 

Manon lifted her other hand, wanting iron to shred her and not steel. 

The others watched behind them, weapons ready. 

But the Bloodhound panted, "Don't you want to know what your 
Second said before she died? What she begged for?" 

Manon hesitated. 

"What a horrible brand on her stomach--wunclean. Did you do that 
yourself, Blackbeak?" 

No. No, no, no-- 

"A baby; she said she'd birthed a stillborn witchling." 

Manon froze entirely. 

And didn't particularly care as the Bloodhound lunged for her throat, 
teeth bared. 

It was not flame or wind that snapped the Bloodhound's neck. 

But invisible hands. 

The crunch echoed through the room, and Manon whirled on Dorian 
Havilliard. His sapphire eyes were utterly merciless. Manon snarled. "How 
dare you take my kill--" 

Men on the deck began screaming, and Abraxos roared. 

Abraxos. 

Manon turned on her heel and sprinted through the wall of warriors, 
careening down the hall, up the stairs-- 

Her iron nails tore chunks out of the slippery wood as she hauled herself 
up, stomach aching. Muggy night air hit her, then the sea's scent, then-- 

There were six of them. 

Their skin was not bone white like the Bloodhound's, but rather a 
mottled darkness--bred for shadows and stealth. Winged, all with 
humanoid faces and bodies-- 


Ilken, one of them hissed as it disemboweled a man in one swipe of its 
claws. We are the ilken, and we have come to feast. Indeed, pirates were 
dead on the deck, blood a coppery tang that filled her senses as she raced 
for where Abraxos's roar had sounded. 

But he was airborne, flapping high, tail swinging. 

The shape-shifter in wyvern form at his side. 

Taking on three of the smaller figures, so much more nimble as they-- 

Flame blasted into the night, along with wind, and ice. 

One ilken melted. The second had its wings snapped. And the third-- 
the third froze into a solid block and shattered upon the deck. 

Eight more ilken landed, one ripping into a screaming sailor's neck on 
the foredeck-- 

Manon's iron teeth snapped down. Flame blasted again, spearing for the 
approaching terrors. 

Only for them to sail through it. 

The ship became a melee as wings and talons tore into delicate human 
hides, as the immortal warriors unleashed themselves upon the ilken that 
landed on the deck. 


Aedion hurtled after Aelin the moment the wyvern roared. 

He got as far as the main deck before those things attacked. 

Before Aelin's flame ruptured from the deck ahead, and he realized his 
cousin could look after herself because shit, the Valg king had been busy. 
Ilken, they'd called themselves. 

There were two of them now before him on the quarterdeck, where he'd 
run to spare the first mate and captain from having their organs ripped out 
of their bellies. Both beasts were nearly eight feet and born of nightmares, 
but in their eyes ... those were human eyes. And their scents ... like rotted 
meat, but ... human. Partially. 

They stood between him and the stairs back to the main deck. "What a 
bounty this hunt has yielded," one said. 

Aedion didn't dare take his attention off them, though he vaguely heard 
Aelin ordering Rowan to go help the other ships. Vaguely heard a wolf and 
a lion's snarl, and felt the kiss of cold as ice slammed into the world. 


Aedion gripped his sword, flipping it once, twice. Had the Pirate Lord 
sold them out to Morath? The way that Bloodhound had looked at Lysandra 

His rage became a song in his blood. 

They sized him up, and Aedion flipped his sword again. Two against 
one--he might stand a chance. 

That was when the third lunged from the shadows behind him. 


Aelin killed one with Goldryn. Beheading. 

The other two ... They hadn't been too pleased by it, if their incessant 
shrieking in the moments following was any indication. 

A lion's roar cleaved the night, and Aelin prayed Gavriel was with 
Aedion somewhere-- 

The two in front of her, blocking the way belowdecks, finally stopped 
their hissy fits long enough to ask, "Where are your flames now?" 

Aelin opened her mouth. But then Fenrys leaped out of a patch of night 
as if he'd simply run through a doorway, and slammed into the one nearest. 
He had a score to settle, it seemed. 

Fenrys's jaws went around the ilken's throat, and the other whirled, 
claws out. 

She was not fast enough to stop it as two sets of claws slashed through 
the white coat, through the shield he kept on himself, and Fenrys's cry of 
pain barked across the water. 

Twin swords of flame plunged through two ilken necks. 

Heads rolled onto the blood-slick deck. 

Fenrys staggered back, making it all of a step before he crashed to the 
planks. Aelin surged for him, swearing. 

Blood and bone and greenish slime--poison. Like those on the 
wyverns' tails. 

Like blowing out a thousand candles, she pushed aside her flame, rallied 
that healing water. Fenrys shifted back into a male, his teeth clenched, 
swearing low and vicious, a hand against his torn ribs. "Don t move," she 
told him. 


She'd immediately sent Rowan to the other ships, and he'd tried to 
argue, but ... had obeyed. She had no idea where the Wing Leader was-- 
the Crochan Queen. Holy gods. 

Aelin readied her magic, trying to calm her raging heart-- 

"The others," panted Aedion, limping for them, coated in black blood, 
"are fine." She almost sobbed in relief--until she noticed the way her 
cousin's eyes shone, and that ... that Gavriel, bloodied and limping worse 
than Aedion, was a step behind his son. What the hell had happened? 

Fenrys groaned, and she focused on his wounds, that poison slithering 
into his blood. She opened her mouth to tell Fenrys to lower his hand when 
wings flapped. 

Not the kind she loved. 

Aedion was instantly before them, sword out, grimacing in pain--but 
one of the ilken lifted a claw-tipped hand. Parley. 

Her cousin halted. But Gavriel shifted imperceptibly closer to the ilken 
as it sniffed at Fenrys and smiled. 

"Don't bother," the thing told Aelin, laughing quietly. "He won't have 
much longer to live." 

Aedion snarled, palming his fighting knives. Aelin rallied her flame. 
Only the hottest of her fire could kill them--anything less and they 
remained unscathed. She'd think about the long-term implications of it 
later. 

"I was sent to deliver a message," the ilken said, smiling over a shoulder 
toward the horizon. "Thank you for confirming in Skull's Bay that you 
carry what His Dark Majesty seeks." 

Aelin's stomach dropped to her feet. 

The key. Erawan knew she had the Wyrdkey. 


Chapter 47


Rowan hauled ass back to their ship, his magic near-flinging him through 
the air. 

The other two ships had been left undisturbed--they'd even had the 
nerve to demand what the hell all the shouting was about. 

Rowan hadn't bothered to explain other than an enemy attack and to 
drop anchor until it was over before he'd left. He'd returned to carnage. 

Returned with his heart beating so wildly he thought he'd vomit with 
relief as he swept in for the landing and beheld Aelin kneeling on the deck. 
Until he saw Fenrys bleeding beneath her hands. 

Until that last ilken landed before them. 

His rage honed itself into a lethal spear, his magic rallying as he dove 
through the sky, aiming for the deck. Concentrated bursts, he'd discovered, 
could get through whatever repellant had been bred into them. 

He'd rip the thing's head right off. 

But then the ilken laughed right as Rowan landed and shifted, looking 
over its thin shoulder. "Morath looks forward to welcoming you," the 
creature smirked, and launched skyward before Rowan could lunge for it. 

But Aelin wasn't moving. Gavriel and Aedion, bloodied and limping, 
were barely moving. Fenrys, his chest a bloody mess with greenish slime-- 
poison ... 

Power glowed at Aelin's hands as she knelt over Fenrys, concentrating 
on that bit of water she'd been given, a drop of water in a sea of fire ... 

Rowan opened his mouth to offer to help when Lysandra panted from 
the shadows, "Is anyone going to deal with that thing, or should 1?" 

Indeed, the ilken was flapping for the distant coast, barely more than a 
bit of blackness against the darkened sky, hurtling for the coast, no doubt to 
fly right to Morath to report. 


Rowan snatched up Fenrys's fallen bow and quiver of black-tipped 
arrows. 

None of them stopped him as he strode to the railing, blood splashing 
beneath his boots. 

The only sounds were the tapping waves, the whimpering of the injured, 
and the groan of the mighty bow as he nocked an arrow and drew back the 
string. Farther and farther. His arms strained, but he honed in on that dark 
speck flapping away. 

"A gold coin says he misses," Fenrys rasped. 

"Save your breath for healing," Aelin snapped. 

"Make it two," Aedion said behind him. "I say he hits." 

"You can all go to hell," Aelin snarled. But then added, "Make it five. 
Ten says he downs it with the first shot." 

"Deal," Fenrys groaned, his voice thick with pain. 

Rowan gritted his teeth. "Remind me why I bother with any of you." 

Then he fired. 

The arrow was nearly invisible as it sailed through the night. 

And with his Fae sight, Rowan saw with perfect clarity as that arrow 
found its mark. 

Right through the thing's head. 

Aelin laughed quietly as it hit the water, its splash visible even from the 
distance. 

Rowan turned and scowled down at her. Light shimmered at her 
fingertips as she held them over Fenrys's ravaged chest. But he turned his 
glare on the male, then on Aedion, and said, "Pay up, pricks." 

Aedion chuckled, but Rowan caught the shadow in Aelin's eyes as she 
resumed healing his former sentinel. Understood why she'd made light of it, 
even with Fenrys injured before her. Because if Erawan now knew their 
whereabouts ... they had to move. Fast. 

And pray Rolfe's directions to the Lock weren't wrong. 


Aedion was sick of surprises. 
Sick of feeling his heart stop dead in his chest. 


As it had when Gavriel had leaped to save his ass with the ilken, the 
Lion tearing into them with a ferocity that had left Aedion standing there 
like a novice with his first practice sword. 

The stupid bastard had injured himself in the process, earning a swipe 
down his arm and ribs that set the male roaring in pain. The venom coating 
those claws, mercifully, had been used up on other men. 

But it was the tang of his father's blood that launched Aedion into 
action--that coppery, mortal scent. Gavriel had only blinked at him as 
Aedion had ignored the throbbing pain in his leg, courtesy of a blow 
moments before right above his knee, and they'd fought back-to-back until 
those creatures were nothing but twitching heaps of bone and flesh. 

He hadn't said a word to the male before sheathing sword and shield 
across his back and stalking to find Aelin. 

She still knelt over Fenrys, offering Rowan nothing more than a pat on 
his thigh as he stormed past to help with the other wounded. A pat on the 
thigh--for making a shot that Aedion was fairly certain most of his Bane 
would have judged to be impossible. 

Aedion set down the pail of water she'd asked him to get for Fenrys, 
trying not to wince as she wiped away the green poison that oozed out. A 
few feet away, his father was tending to a blubbering pirate--who had 
barely more than a tear to the thigh. 

Fenrys hissed, and Aelin let out a grunt of pain herself. Aedion pushed 
in. "What?" 

Aelin shook her head once, a sharp dismissal. But he watched as she 
locked eyes with Fenrys--locked and held them in a way that told Aedion 
whatever she was about to do would hurt. He'd seen that same look pass 
between healer and soldier a hundred times on killing fields and in the 
healers' tents afterward. 

"Why," Fenrys panted, "didn't"--another pant--"you just melt them?" 

"Because I wanted to get some information out of them before you 
charged in, you bossy Fae bastard." She gritted her teeth again, and Aedion 
braced a hand on her back as the poison no doubt brushed against her 
magic. As she tried to wash it out. She leaned a bit into his touch. 

"Can heal on my own," Fenrys rasped, noting the strain. "Get to the 
others." 





"Oh, please," she snapped. "You're all insufferable. That thing had 
poison on its claws--" 

"The others--" 

"Tell me how your magic works--how you can leap between places like 
that." A clever, easy way to keep him focused elsewhere. 

Aedion scanned the deck, making sure he wasn't needed, and then 
carefully sopped up the blood and poison leaking from Fenrys's chest. It 
had to hurt like hell. The insistent throbbing in his leg was likely nothing by 
comparison. 

"No one knows where it comes from--what it is," Fenrys said between 
shallow breaths, fingers curling and uncurling at his sides. "But it lets me 
slip between folds in the world. Only short distances, and only a few times 
before I'm drained, but ... it's useful on a killing field." He panted through 
his clenched teeth as the outer edges of his gash began to reach for each 
other. "Aside from that, 've got nothing special. Speed, strength, swift 
healing ... more than the average Fae, but the same stock of gifts. I can 
shield myself and others, but can't summon an element." 

Aelin's hand wavered slightly over his wound. "What's your shield 
made of, then?" 

Fenrys tried and failed to shrug. But Gavriel muttered from where he 
worked on the still-whimpering pirate, "Arrogance." 

Aelin snorted, but didn't dare take her eyes off Fenrys's injury as she 
said, "So you do have a sense of humor, Gavriel." 

The Lion of Doranelle gave a wary smile over his shoulder. The rare- 
sighted, restrained twin to Aedion's own flashing grins. Aelin had called 
him Uncle Kitty-Cat all of one time before Aedion had snarled viciously 
enough to make her think carefully before using the term again. Gavriel, to 
his credit, had merely given Aelin a long-suffering sigh that seemed to be 
used only when she or Fenrys were around. 

"That sense of humor only appears about once every century," Fenrys 
rasped, "so you'd better hope you Settle, or else that's the last time you'll 
see it." Aelin chuckled, though it faded quickly. Something cold and oily 
slid into Aedion's gut. "Sorry," Fenrys added, wincing either at the words or 
the pain. 

Aelin asked before Aedion let his words sink in, "Where did you come 
from? Lorcan, I know, was a bastard in the slums." 


"Lorcan was a bastard in Maeve's palace, don't worry," Fenrys smirked, 
his bronze face wan. Aelin's lips twitched toward a smile. "Connall and I 
were the sons of nobles who dwell in the southeastern part of Maeve's lands 
... He hissed. 

"Your parents?" Aedion pressed when Aelin herself seemed to be 
straining for words. He'd seen her heal little cuts, and slowly repair 
Manon's wound over days, but ... 

"Our mother was a warrior," Fenrys said, each word labored. "She 
trained us as such. Our father was, too, but was often away at war. She was 
tasked with defending our home, our lands. And reporting to Maeve." 
Rasping, laboring breaths from both of them. Aedion shifted so that Aelin 
could lean wholly against him, biting down on the weight it put on his 
already-swollen knee. "When Con and I were thirty, we were straining at 
the leash to go to Doranelle with her--to see the city, meet the queen, and 
do ... what young males like to do with money in their pockets and youth 
on their sides. Only Maeve took one look at us and ..." He needed longer to 
catch his breath this time. "It didn't go well from there." 

Aedion knew the rest; so did Aelin. 

The last of the green slime slid out of Fenrys's chest. And Aelin 
breathed, "She knows you hate the oath, doesn't she?" 

"Maeve knows," Fenrys said. "And I have no doubt she sent me here, 
hoping Id be tortured by the temporary freedom." 

Aelin's hands were shaking, her body shuddering against his own. 
Aedion slipped an arm around her waist. "I'm sorry you're bound to her," 
was all Aelin managed. 

The wounds in Fenrys's chest began knitting together. Rowan stalked 
over as if sensing she was fading. 

Fenrys's face was still grayish, still taut, as he glanced up at Rowan and 
said to Aelin, "This is what we are meant to do--protect, serve, cherish. 
What Maeve offers is ... a mockery of that." He surveyed the wounds now 
healing on his chest, mending so slowly. "But it is what calls to a Fae 
male's blood, what guides him. What we're all looking for, even when we 
say we're not." 

Aedion's father had gone still over the wounded pirate. 

Aedion, surprising even himself, said over his shoulder to Gavriel, "And 
do you find Maeve fulfills that--or are you like Fenrys?" 


His father blinked, about all the shock he'd show, and then straightened, 
the wounded sailor before him now sleeping off the healing. Aedion bore 
the brunt of his tawny stare, tried to shut out the kernel of hope that shone 
in the Lion's eyes. "I come from a noble house as well, the youngest of 
three brothers. I wouldn't inherit or rule, so I took to soldiering. It earned 
Maeve's eye, and her offer. There was--is no greater honor." 

"That's not an answer," Aedion said quietly. 

His father rolled his shoulders. Fidgeting. "I only hated it once. Only 
wanted to leave once." 

He didn't continue. And Aedion knew what the unspoken words were. 

Aelin brushed a strand of hair out of her face. "You loved her that 
much?" 

Aedion tried not to let his gratitude that she'd asked for him show. 

Gavriel's hands were white-knuckled as they folded into fists. "She was 
a bright star in centuries of darkness. I would have followed that star to the 
ends of the earth, if she had let me. But she didn't, and I respected her 
wishes to stay away. To never seek her out again. I went to another 
continent and didn't let myself look back." 

The ship's creaking and the groaning of the injured were the only 
sounds. Aedion clamped down on the urge to stand and walk away. He'd 
look like a child--not a general who'd fought his way through knee-deep 
gore on killing fields. 

Aelin said, again because Aedion couldn't bring himself to say the 
words, "You would have tried to break the blood oath for her? For them?" 

"Honor is my code," Gavriel said. "But if Maeve had tried to harm 
either you or her, Aedion, I would have done everything in my power to get 
you out." 

The words hit Aedion, then flowed through him. He didn't let himself 
think about it, the truth he'd felt in each word. The way his name had 
sounded on his father's lips. 

His father checked the injured pirate for any lingering injuries, then 
moved on to another. Those tawny eyes slid to Aedion's knee, swollen 
beneath his pants. "You need to tend to that, or it'll be too stiff to function 
in a few hours." 

Aedion felt Aelin's attention snap to him, scanning him for injury, but 
he held his father's gaze and said, "I know how to treat my own injuries." 


The battlefield healers and the Bane had taught him enough over the years. 
"Tend to your own wounds." Indeed, the male had blood crusting his shirt. 
Lucky--so lucky the venom had already been wiped off those claws. 
Gavriel blinked down at himself, his band of tattoos bobbing as he 
swallowed, then continued without another word. 

Aelin pushed off Aedion at last, trying and failing to get to her feet. 
Aedion reached for her as the focus went out of her now-dull eyes, but 
Rowan was already there, smoothly sweeping her up before she kissed the 
planks. Too fast--she must have drained her reserves too fast, and without 
any food in her system. 

Rowan held his stare, Aelin's hair limp as she rested her head against 
his chest. The strain--Aedion's guts twisted at it. Morath knew what it was 
going up against. Who it was going up against. Erawan had built his 
commanders accordingly. Rowan nodded as if in confirmation of Aedion's 
thoughts, but only said, "Elevate that knee." 

Fenrys had slipped into a light sleep before Rowan carried Aelin below. 

So Aedion kept his own company for the rest of the night: first on 
watch, then sitting against the mast on the quarterdeck for a few hours, knee 
indeed elevated, unwilling to descend into the cramped, dim interior. 

Sleep was finally starting to tug at him when wood groaned a few feet 
behind, and he knew it did so only because she willed it, to keep from 
startling him. 

The ghost leopard sat beside him, tail twitching, and met his eyes for a 
moment before she laid her enormous head on his thigh. 

In silence, they watched the stars flicker over the calm waves, Lysandra 
nuzzling her head against his hip. 

The starlight stained her coat with muted silver, and a smile ghosted 
Aedion's lips. 


Chapter 48


They worked through the night, weighing anchor only long enough for the 
crew to patch up the hole in Manon's room. It would hold for now, the 
captain told Dorian, but gods help them if they hit another storm before 
they got to the marshes. 

They tended to the wounded for hours, and Dorian was grateful for the 
little healing magic Rowan had taught him as he pieced flesh back together. 
Pretending it was a puzzle, or bits of torn cloth, kept his meager dinner 
from coming back up. But the poison ... He left that to Rowan, Aelin, and 
Gavriel. 

By the time the morning had shifted into a sickly gray, their faces were 
sallow, dark smudges etched deep beneath their eyes. Fenrys, at least, was 
limping around, and Aedion had let Aelin tend to his knee only long enough 
to get him walking again, but ... They'd seen better days. 

Dorian's legs were wobbling a bit as he scanned the blood-soaked deck. 
Someone had dumped the creatures' bodies overboard, along with the worst 
of the gore, but ... If what the Bloodhound had said was true, they didn't 
have the luxury of pulling into a harbor to fix the rest of the damage to the 
ship. 

A low, rumbling growl sounded, and Dorian looked across the deck, to 
the prow. 

The witch was still there. Still tending to Abraxos's wounds, as she had 
been all night. One of the creatures had bit him a few times--thankfully, no 
poison in their teeth, but ... he'd lost some blood. Manon had not let 
anyone near him. 

Aelin had tried once, and when Manon snarled at her, Aelin had cursed 
enough to make everyone else halt, saying she'd rutting deserve it if the 
beast died. Manon had threatened to rip out her spine, Aelin had given her a 
vulgar gesture, and Lysandra had been forced to monitor the space between 


them for an hour, perched in the rigging of the mainmast in ghost leopard 
form, tail swaying in the breeze. 

But now ... Manon's white hair was limp, the warm morning wind 
tugging lazily at the strands as she leaned against Abraxos's side. 

Dorian knew he was toeing a dangerous line. The other night, he'd been 
ready to slowly strip her naked, to put those chains to good use. And when 
he'd found her gold eyes devouring him as intently as he wanted to devour 
other parts of her ... 

As if sensing his stare, Manon peered over at him. 

Even from across the deck, every inch between them went taut. 

Of course, Aedion and Fenrys instantly noted it, pausing where they 
now washed blood off the deck, and the latter snorted. Both had healed 
enough to walk, but neither moved to interfere as Manon prowled toward 
him. If she hadn't fled or attacked yet, they must have decided she wasn't 
going to bother doing so now. 

Manon took up a space at the rail, gazing out at the endless water, the 
wisps of pink clouds smeared along the horizon. Dark blood stained her 
shirt, her palms. "Do I have you to thank for this freedom?" 

He braced his forearms on the wooden rail. "Maybe." 

Gold eyes slid to him. "The magic--what is it?" 

"I don't know," Dorian said, studying his hands. "It felt like an 
extension of me. Like real hands I could command." 

For a heartbeat, he thought of how they'd felt pinning her wrists--how 
her body had reacted, loose and tense where he usually liked it to be, while 
his mouth had barely caressed hers. Her golden eyes flared as if recalling it 
as well, and Dorian found himself saying, "I wouldn't harm you." 

"You liked killing the Bloodhound, though." 

He didn't bother keeping the ice from his eyes. "Yes." 

Manon stepped close enough to brush a finger over the pale band 
around his throat, and he forgot that there was a ship full of people 
watching. "You could have made her suffer--you went for a clean blow 
instead. Why?" 

"Because even with our enemies, there's a line." 

"Then you have your answer." 

"I didn't ask a question." 


Manon snorted. "You've had that look in your eyes all night--if you're 
becoming a monster like the rest of us. The next time you kill, remind 
yourself of that line." 

"Where do you stand on that line, witchling?" 

She met his gaze, as if willing him to see a century of all that she'd 
done. "I am not mortal. I do not play by your rules. I have killed and hunted 
men for sport. Do not mistake me for a human woman, princeling." 

"I have no interest in human women," he purred. "Too breakable." 

Even as he said it, the words struck some deep, aching wound in him. 

"The ilken," he said, pushing past that pain. "Did you know about 
them?" 

"T assume they are a part of whatever is in those mountains." 

A hoarse female voice snapped, "What do you mean, whatever is in 
those mountains?" 

Dorian nearly leaped out of his skin. Aelin, it seemed, had been taking 
some notes from her ghost leopard friend. Even Manon blinked at the 
blood-drenched queen now behind them. 

Manon eyed Aedion and Fenrys as they heard Aelin's demand and came 
over, followed by Gavriel. Fenrys's shirt was still hanging in strips. At least 
Rowan was now keeping watch from the rigging, and Lysandra was off 
flying overhead, scouting for danger. 

The witch said, "I never saw the ilken. Only heard of them--heard their 
screaming as they died, then their roaring as they were remade. I didn't 
know that's what they were. Or that Erawan would send them so far from 
their aerie. My Shadows caught a glimpse of them, just once. Their 
description matches what attacked last night." 

"Are the ilken mostly scouts or warriors?" Aelin said. 

The fresh air seemed to have made Manon amenable to divulging 
information, because she leaned her back against the railing, facing the 
cabal of killers around them. "We don't know. They used the cloud cover to 
their advantage. My Shadows can find anything that doesn't want to be 
found, and yet they could not hunt or track these things." 

Aelin tensed a bit, scowling at the water flowing past them. And then 
she said nothing, as if the words had vanished and exhaustion--something 
heavier than that--had set in. 

"Snap out of it," Manon said. 





Aedion loosed a warning growl. 

Aelin slowly lifted her eyes to the witch, and Dorian braced himself. 

"So you miscalculated," Manon said. "So they tracked you. Don't get 
distracted with the minor defeats. This is war. Cities will be lost, people 
slaughtered. And if I were you, I would be more concerned about why they 
sent so few of the ilken." 

"If you were me," Aelin murmured in a tone that had Dorian's magic 
rising, ice cooling his fingertips. Aedion's hand slid to his sword. "If you 
were me." A low, bitter laugh. Dorian had not heard that sound since ... 
since a blood-soaked bedroom in a glass castle that no longer existed. 
"Well, you are not me, Blackbeak, so I'Il trust you to keep your musings on 
the matter to yourself." 

"T am not a Blackbeak," Manon said. 

They all stared at her. But the witch merely watched the queen. 

Aelin said with a wave of her scar-flecked hand, "Right. That matter of 
business. Let's hear the story, then." 

Dorian wondered if they would come to blows, but Manon simply 
waited a few heartbeats, looked toward the horizon again, and said, "When 
my grandmother stripped me of my title as heir and Wing Leader, she also 
stripped my heritage. She told me that my father was a Crochan Prince, and 
she had killed my mother and him for conspiring to end the feud between 
our peoples and break the curse on our lands." 

Dorian glanced to Aedion. The Wolf of the North's face was taut, his 
Ashryver eyes shining bright, churning at the possibilities of all that Manon 
implied. 

Manon said a bit numbly, as if it was the first time she'd even spoken it 
to herself, "I am the last Crochan Queen--the last direct descendant of 
Rhiannon Crochan herself." 

Aelin only sucked on a tooth, brows lifting. 

"And," Manon continued, "whether my grandmother acknowledges it or 
not, I am heir to the Blackbeak Clan. My witches, who have fought at my 
side for a hundred years, have spent most of it killing Crochans. Dreaming 
of a homeland that 7 promised to return them to. And now I am banished, 
my Thirteen scattered and lost. And now I am heir to our enemy's crown. 
So you are not the only one, Majesty, who has plans that go awry. So get 
yourself together and figure out what to do next." 


Two queens--there were two queens among them, Dorian realized. 

Aelin closed her eyes and let out a rough, breathy laugh. Aedion again 
tensed, as if that laugh might easily end in violence or peace, but Manon 
stood there. Weathering the storm. 

When Aelin opened her eyes, her smile subdued but edged, she said to 
the Witch-Queen, "I knew I saved your sorry ass for a reason." 

Manon's answering smile was terrifying. 

The males all seemed to loosen a tight breath, Dorian himself included. 

But then Fenrys pulled at his lower lip, scanning the skies. "What I 
don't get is why wait so long to do any of this? If Erawan wants you lot 
dead'"--a nod toward Dorian and Aelin--'"'why let you mature, grow 
powerful?" 

Dorian tried not to shudder at the thought. How unprepared they'd been. 

"Because I escaped Erawan," Aelin said. Dorian tried not to remember 
that night ten years ago, but the memory of it snapped through him, and her, 
and Aedion. "He thought I was dead. And Dorian ... his father shielded 
him. As best he could." 

Dorian shut out that memory, too. Especially as Manon angled her head 
in question. 

Fenrys said, "Maeve knew you were alive. Odds are, so did Erawan." 

"Maybe she told Erawan," Aedion said. 

Fenrys whipped his head to the general. "She's never had any contact 
with Erawan, or Adarlan." 

"As far as you know," Aedion mused. "Unless she's a talker in the 
bedroom." 

Fenrys's eyes darkened. "Maeve does not share power. She saw Adarlan 
as an inconvenience. Still does." 

Aedion countered, "Everyone can be bought for a price." 

"Nameless is the price of Maeve's allegiance," Fenrys snapped. "It can't 
be purchased." 

Aelin went utterly still at the warrior's words. 

She blinked at him, her brows narrowing as her lips silently mouthed 
the words he'd said. 

"What is it?" Aedion demanded. 

Aelin murmured, "Nameless is my price." Aedion opened his mouth, no 
doubt to ask what had snagged her interest, but Aelin frowned at Manon. 


"Can your kind see the future? See it as an oracle can?" 

"Some," Manon admitted. "The Bluebloods claim to." 

"Can other Clans?" 

"They say that for the Ancients, past and present and future bleed 
together." 

Aelin shook her head and walked toward the door that led to the hall of 
cramped cabins. Rowan swooped off the rigging and shifted, his feet hitting 
the planks just as he finished. He didn't so much as look at them as he 
followed her into the hall and shut the door behind them. 

"What was that about?" Fenrys asked. 

"An Ancient,' Dorian mused, then murmured to Manon, "Baba 
Yellowlegs." 

They all turned to him. But Manon's fingers brushed against her 
collarbone--where the necklace of Aelin's scars from Yellowlegs still 
ringed her neck in stark white. 

"This winter, she was at your castle," Manon said to him. "Working as a 
fortune-teller." 

"And what--she said something to that degree?" Aedion crossed his 
arms. He'd known of the visit, Dorian recalled. Aedion had always kept an 
eye on the witches--on all the power players of the realm, he'd once said. 

Manon stared the general down. "Yellowlegs was a fortune-teller--a 
powerful oracle. I bet she knew who the queen was the moment she saw 
her. And saw things she planned to sell to the highest bidder." Dorian tried 
not to flinch at the memory. Aelin had butchered Yellowlegs when she'd 
threatened to sell his secrets. Aelin had never implied a threat against her 
own. Manon continued, "Yellowlegs wouldn't have told the queen anything 
outright, only in veiled terms. So it'd drive the girl mad when she figured it 
out." 

A pointed glance at the door through which Aelin had vanished. 

None of them said anything else, even as they later ate cold porridge for 
breakfast. 

The cook, it seemed, hadn't made it through the night. 


Rowan knocked on the door of their private bathing room. She'd locked it. 
Walked into their room, then into the bathing room, and locked him out. 

And now she was puking her guts up. 

"Aelin," he growled softly. 

A ragged intake of breath, then retching, then--more vomiting. 

"Aelin," he snarled, debating how long until it was socially acceptable 
for him to break down the door. Act like a prince, she'd snarled at him the 
other night. 

"I don't feel well," was her muffled response. Her voice was hollow, flat 
in a way he hadn't heard for some time now. 

"Then let me in so I can take care of you," he said as calmly and 
rationally as he could. 

She'd locked him out--locked him out. 

"I don't want you to see me like this." 

"Tve seen you wet yourself. I can handle vomiting. Which I have also 
seen you do before." 

Ten seconds. Ten more seconds seemed like a fair enough amount of 
time before he crunched down on the handle and splintered the lock. 

"Just--give me a minute." 

"What was it about Fenrys's words that set you off?" He'd heard it all 
from his post on the mast. 

Utter silence. Like she was spooling the raw terror back into herself, 
shoving it down into a place where she wouldn't look at it or feel it or 
acknowledge it. Or tell him about it. 

"Aelin. " 

The lock turned. 

Her face was gray, her eyes red-rimmed. Her voice broke as she said, "I 
want to talk to Lysandra." 

Rowan looked at the bucket she'd half filled, then at her bloodless lips. 
At the sweat beaded on her brow. 

His heart stopped dead in his chest as he contemplated that ... that she 
might not be lying. 

And why she might be ill. He tried to scent her, but the vomit was too 
overpowering, the space too small and full of brine. He stumbled back a 
step, shutting out the thoughts. Without another word, he left their room. 


He was numb as he hunted down the shifter, now returned and in human 
form as she devoured a cold, soggy breakfast. With a concerned look, 
Lysandra silently did as he commanded. 

Rowan shifted and soared so high that the ship turned into a bobbing 
speck below. Clouds cooled his feathers; the wind roared over the pure 
panic thundering in his heart. 

He planned to lose himself in the awakening sky while scouting for 
danger, to sort himself out before he returned to her and started asking 
questions that he might not be ready to hear the answers to. 

But the coast appeared--and only his magic kept him from tumbling out 
of the sky at what the first rays of the sun revealed. 

Broad, sparkling rivers and snaking streams flowed throughout the 
undulating emerald and gold of the grasslands and reeds lining them, the 
burnt gold of the sandbanks flanking either side. 

And where little fishing villages had once watched over the sea ... Fire. 

Dozens of those villages burning. 

On the ship beneath him, the sailors began to shout, calling to one 
another as the coast at last broke over the horizon and the smoke became 
visible. 

Eyllwe. 

Eyllwe was burning. 


Chapter 49


Elide didn't speak to Lorcan for three days. 

She wouldn't have spoken to him for another three, maybe for three 
damn months, if necessity hadn't required them to break their hateful 
silence. 

Her cycle had come. And through whatever steady, healthy diet she'd 
been consuming this past month, it had gone from an inconsistent trickle to 
the deluge she'd awoken to this morning. 

She'd hurtled from the narrow bed in the cabin to the small privy on 
board, rifled through every drawer and box she could find, but ... clearly, a 
woman had never spent any time on this infernal boat. She resorted to 
ripping up the embroidered tablecloth for liners, and by the time she'd 
cleaned herself up, Lorcan was awake and already steering the boat. 

She said flatly to him, "I need supplies." 

"You still reek of blood." 

"I suspect I will reek of blood for several more days, and it will get 
worse before it gets better, so I need supplies. Now." 

He turned from his usual spot near the prow, sniffing once. Her face was 
burning, her stomach a knotted mess of cramping. "I'll stop at the next 
town." 

"When will that be?" The map was of no use to her. 

"By nightfall." 

They'd sailed right through every town or outpost along the river, 
surviving on the fish Lorcan had caught. She'd been so annoyed at her own 
helplessness that after the first day, she'd started copying his movements-- 
and had earned herself a fat trout in the process. She'd made him kill it and 
gut it and cook it, but ... she'd at least caught the thing. 

Elide said, "Fine." 

Lorcan said, "Fine." 


She aimed for the cabin to find some other fabrics to tide her over, but 
Lorcan said, "You barely bled the last time." 

The last thing she wanted to do was have this conversation. "Perhaps 
my body finally felt safe enough to be normal." 

Because even with him murdering that man, lying, and then spitting the 
truth about Aelin in her face ... Lorcan would go up against any threat 
without a second thought. Perhaps for his own survival, but he'd promised 
her protection. She was able to sleep through the night because he lay on 
the floor between her and the door. 

"So ... there's nothing wrong, then." He didn't bother to look at her as 
he said it. 

But she cocked her head, studying the hard muscles of his back. Even 
while refusing to speak to him, she'd watched him--and made excuses to 
watch as he went through his exercises each day, usually shirtless. 

"No, there's nothing wrong," she said. At least, she hoped. But Finnula, 
her nursemaid, had always clicked her tongue and said her cycles were 
spotty--too light and irregular. For this one to have come precisely a month 
later ... She didn't feel like wondering about it. 

Lorcan said, "Good. It'd delay us if it were otherwise." 

She rolled her eyes at his back, not at all surprised by the answer, and 
limped into the cabin. 


He'd needed to stop anyway, Lorcan told himself as he watched Elide barter 
with an innkeeper in town for the supplies she needed. 

She'd wrapped her dark hair in a discarded red kerchief she must have 
scrounged up on that pitiful little barge, and even used a nasally accent 
while she spoke to the woman, her entire countenance a far cry from the 
graceful, quiet woman he'd spent three days ignoring. 

Which had been fine. He'd used these three days to sort out his plans for 
Aelin Galathynius, how he'd return the favor she'd dealt him. 

The inn seemed safe enough, so Lorcan left Elide to her bartering-- 
turned out, she wanted new clothes, too--and wandered the ramshackle 
streets of the backwater town in search of supplies. 


The streets were abuzz with river traders and fisherfolk mooring for the 
night. Lorcan managed to intimidate his way into buying a crate of apples, 
dried venison, and some oats for half their usual price. Just to get him away, 
the merchant along the crumbling quay threw in a few pears--for the lovely 
lady, he'd said. 

Lorcan, arms full of his wares, was almost to the barge when the words 
echoed in his head, an off-kilter pealing. 

He hadn't taken Elide past that section of the quay. Hadn't spied the 
man while he'd been docking, or when they'd left. Rumor could account for 
it, but this was a river town: strangers were always coming and going, and 
paid for their anonymity. 

He hurried back to the barge. Fog had rippled in from the river, clouding 
the town and the opposite bank. By the time he dumped the crate and wares 
onto the boat, not even bothering to tie them down, the streets had emptied. 

His magic stirred. He scanned the fog, the splotches of gold where 
candles shone in windows. Not right, not right, not right, his magic 
whispered. 

Where was she? 

Hurry, he willed her, counting the blocks they'd taken to the inn. She 
should have been back by now. 

The fog pressed in. Squeaking sounded at his boots. 

Lorcan snarled at the cobblestones as rats streamed past--toward the 
water. They flung themselves into the river, crawling and clawing over one 
another. 

Something wasn't coming--something was here. 


The innkeeper insisted she try on the clothes before she bought them. She 
bundled them in Elide's arms and pointed her toward a room in the back of 
the inn. 

Men stared at her--too eagerly--as she passed and strode down a narrow 
hall. Typical of Lorcan to leave her while he sought whatever he needed. 
Elide shoved into the room, finding it black and chilled. She twisted, 
scanning for a candle and flint. 

The door snapped shut, sealing her in. 


Elide lunged for the handle as that little voice whispered, Run run run 
run run run. 

She slammed into something muscled, bony, and leathery. 

It reeked of spoiled meat and old blood. 

A candle sparked to life across the room. Revealing a wooden table, an 
empty hearth, sealed windows, and ... 

Vernon. Sitting on the other side of the table, smiling at her like a cat. 

Strong hands tipped in claws clamped on her shoulders, nails cutting 
through her leathers. The ilken held her firmly as her uncle drawled, "What 
an adventure you've had, Elide." 


ASOE 


"How did you find me?" Elide breathed, the reek of the ilken nearly enough 
to make her vomit. 

Her uncle rose to his feet in a fluid, unhurried movement, straightening 
his green tunic. "Asking questions to buy yourself time? Clever, but 
expected." He jerked his chin to the creature. It loosed a low, guttural 
clicking sound. 

The door opened behind it, revealing two other ilken now crowding the 
hall with their wings and hideous faces. Oh gods. Oh, gods. 

Think think think think think. 

"Your companion, last we heard, was putting supplies on his boat and 
unmooring it. You probably should have paid him more." 

"He's my husband," she hissed. "You have no right to take me from him 
--none." Because once she was married, Vernon's wardenship over her life 
ended. 

Vernon let out a low laugh. "Lorcan Salvaterre, Maeve's second-in- 
command, is your husband? Really, Elide." He waved a lazy hand to the 
ilken. "We depart now." 

Fight now--now, before they had the chance to move her, to get her 
away. 

But where to run? The innkeeper had sold her out, someone had 
betrayed their location on this river-- 

The ilken tugged at her. She planted her heels onto the wooden slats, 
little good it would do. 

It let out a low laugh and brought its mouth to her ear. "Your blood 
smells clean." 

She recoiled, but it gripped her hard, its grayish tongue tickling the side 
of her neck. Thrashing, she still could do nothing as it twisted them into the 


hall and toward the two waiting ilken in it. To the back door, not ten feet 
away, already open to the night beyond. 

"You see what I shielded you from at Morath, Elide?" Vernon crooned, 
falling into step behind them. She slammed her feet into the wooden floor, 
over and over, straining for the wall, for anything to have leverage to push 
and fight against it-- 


Lorcan had left--he'd gotten everything he needed from her and left. 
She'd slowed him down, had brought enemy after enemy after him. 

"And whatever will you do back at Morath," Vernon mused, "now that 
Manon Blackbeak is dead?" 

Elide's chest cracked open at the words. Manon-- 

"Gutted by her own grandmother and thrown off the side of the Keep 
for her disobedience. Of course, Ill shield you from your relatives, but ... 
Erawan will be interested to learn what you've been up to. What you ... 
took from Kaltain." 

The stone in her jacket's breast pocket. 

It thrummed and whispered, awakening as she bucked. 

No one in the now-silent inn at the opposite end of the hall bothered to 
come around the corner and investigate her wordless shouting. Another 
ilken stepped into view just beyond the open back door. 

Four of them. And Lorcan had left-- 

The stone at her breast began to seethe. 

But a voice that was young and old, wise and sweet, whispered, Do not 
touch it. Do not use it. Do not acknowledge it. 

It had been inside Kaltain--had driven her mad. Had made her into that 

.. Shell. 

A shell for something else to fill. 

The open door loomed. 

Think think think. 

She couldn't breathe enough to think, the ilken reek around her 
promising the sort of horrors she'd endure when they got her back to 
Morath-- 


No, she wouldn't go. She wouldn't let them take her, break and use her 

One shot. She'd have one shot. 

No, whispered the voice in her head. No-- 

But there was a knife at her uncle's side as he strolled ahead and out the 
door. It was all she'd need. She'd seen Lorcan do it enough while hunting. 

Vernon paused in the back courtyard, a large, rectangular iron box 
waiting before him. 

There was a small window in it. 

And handles on two of its edges. 

She knew what the ilken were for as the three others fell into place 
around it. 

They'd shove her inside, lock the door, and fly her back to Morath. 

The box was little bigger than a coffin standing upright. 

Its door was already open. 

The ilken would have to release her to throw her inside. For a heartbeat, 
they'd let go. She'd have to use it to her advantage. 

Vernon loitered beside the box. She didn't dare look at his knife. 

A sob broke from her throat. She'd die here--in this filthy courtyard, 
with these awful things around her. She'd never see the sun again, or laugh, 
or hear music-- 

The ilken stirred around the box, wings rustling. 

Five feet. Four. Three. 

No, no, no, the wise voice begged her. 

She would not be taken back to Morath. She would not let them touch 
her and corrupt her-- 

The ilken shoved her forward, a violent thrust meant to send her 
staggering into the box. 

Elide twisted, slamming face-first into the edge instead, her nose 
crunching, but she whirled on her uncle. Her ankle roared as she set her 
weight on it to lunge for the knife at his side. 

Vernon didn't have time to realize what she intended as she whipped the 
knife free from its sheath at his hip. As she flipped the knife in her fingers, 
her other hand wrapping around the hilt. 

As her shoulders curved inward, her chest caving, and she drove the 
blade home. 


Lorcan had the kill shot. 

Hidden in the fog, the four ilken couldn't detect him as the man he was 
certain was Elide's uncle had that ilken haul her toward that prison-box. 

It was on him that Lorcan had trained his hatchet. 

Elide was sobbing. In terror and despair. 

Each sound whetted his rage into something so lethal Lorcan could 
barely see straight. 

Then the ilken threw her into that iron box. 

And Elide proved she wasn't bluffing in her claim to never return to 
Morath. 

He heard her nose break as she hit the rim of the box, heard her uncle's 
cry of surprise as she rebounded and lunged for him-- 

And grabbed his dagger. Not to kill him. 

For the first time in five centuries, Lorcan knew true fear as Elide 
turned that knife on herself, the blade angled to plunge up and into her 
heart. 

He threw his hatchet. 

As the tip of that dagger pierced the leather over her ribs, the wooden 
handle of his hatchet slammed into her wrist. 

Elide went down with a cry, the dagger flying wide-- 

Lorcan was already moving as they whirled toward where he'd perched 
on the rooftop. He leaped to the nearest one, to the weapons he'd positioned 
there minutes before, knowing they'd emerge from this door-- 

His next knife went through the wing of an ilken. Then another to keep 
it down before they pinpointed his location. But Lorcan was already 
sprinting to the third rooftop flanking the courtyard. To the sword he'd left 
there. He hurled it right through the face of the closest one. 

Two left, along with Vernon, screaming now to get the girl in the box-- 

Elide was running like hell for the narrow alley out of the courtyard, not 
the broad street. The alley, too small for the ilken to fit, especially with all 
the debris and trash littered throughout. Good girl. 

Lorcan leaped and rolled onto the next roof, to the two remaining 
daggers-- 


He threw them, but the ilken had already learned his aim, his throwing 
style. 

They hadn't learned Elide's. 

She hadn't just gone into the alley to save herself. She'd gone after the 
hatchet. 

And Lorcan watched as that woman crept up behind the distracted ilken 
and drove the hatchet into its wings. 

With an injured wrist. With her nose leaking blood down her face. 

The ilken screamed, thrashing to grab her, even as it crashed to its 
knees. 

Where she wanted it. 

The axe was swinging again before its scream finished sounding. 

The sound was cut off a heartbeat later as its head bounced to the 
stones. 

Lorcan hurtled off the roof, aiming for the one remaining ilken now 
seething at her-- 

But it pivoted and ran to where Vernon was cowering by the door, his 
face bloodless. 

Sobbing, her own blood sprayed on the stones, Elide whirled toward her 
uncle, too. Axe already lifting. 

But the ilken reached her uncle, snatched him up in its strong arms, and 
launched them both into the sky. 

Elide threw the hatchet anyway. 

It missed the ilken's wing by a whisper of wind. 

The axe slammed to the cobblestones, taking out a chunk of rock. Right 
near the ilken with the shredded wings--now crawling toward the courtyard 
exit. 

Lorcan watched as Elide picked up his axe and walked toward the 
hissing, broken beast. 

It lashed at her with its claws. Elide easily sidestepped the swipe. 

It screamed as she stomped on its wrecked wing, halting its crawl to 
freedom. 

When it fell silent, she said in a quiet, merciless voice he'd never heard 
her use, clear despite the blood clogging one nostril, "I want Erawan to 
know that the next time he sends you after me like a pack of dogs, Ill 
return the favor. I want Erawan to know that the next time I see him, I will 


carve Manon's name on his gods-damned heart." Tears rolled down her 
face, silent and unending as the wrath that now sculpted her features into a 
thing of mighty and terrible beauty. 

"But it seems like tonight isn't really your night," Elide said to the 
ilken, lifting the hatchet again over a shoulder. The ilken might have been 
whimpering as she smiled grimly. "Because it takes only one to deliver a 
message. And your companions are already on their way." 

The axe fell. 

Flesh and bone and blood spilled onto the stones. 

She stood there, staring at the corpse, at the reeking blood that dribbled 
from its neck. 

Lorcan, perhaps a bit numbly, walked over and took the axe from her 
hands. How she'd been able to use it with the sore wrist-- 

She hissed and whimpered at the movement. As if whatever force had 
rushed through her blood had vanished, leaving only pain behind. 

She clutched her wrist, utterly silent as he circled the dead ilken and 
severed their heads from their bodies. One after another, retrieving his 
weapons as he went. 

People inside the inn were stirring, wondering at the noise, wondering if 
it was safe to come out to see what had happened to the girl they'd so 
willingly betrayed. 

For a heartbeat, Lorcan debated ending that innkeeper. 

But Elide said, "Enough death." 

Tears streaked through the splattered black blood on her cheeks--blood 
that was a mockery of the smattering of freckles. Blood, crimson and pure, 
ran from her nose down her mouth and chin, already caking. 

So he sheathed the hatchet and scooped her into his arms. She didn't 
object. 

He carried her through the fog-wrapped town, to where their boat was 
tied. Already, onlookers had gathered, no doubt to scavenge their supplies 
when the ilken left. A snarl from Lorcan had them skittering into the mist. 

As he stepped onto the barge, the boat rocking beneath him, Elide said, 
"He told me you'd left." 

Lorcan still didn't set her down, holding her aloft with one arm as he 
untied the ropes. "You believed him." 


She wiped at the blood on her face, then winced at the tender wrist-- 
and broken nose. He'd have to tend to that. Even then, it might very well be 
slightly crooked forever. He doubted she'd care. 

Knew she'd perhaps see that crooked nose as a sign that she'd fought 
and survived. 

Lorcan put her down at last, atop the crate of apples--tright where he 
could see her. She sat silently as he took up the pole and pushed them away 
from the dock, from that hateful town, glad for the cover of mist as they 
drifted downstream. They could perhaps afford two more days on the river 
before they'd have to cut inland to shake any enemies trailing them. Good 
thing they were close enough to Eyllwe now to make it in a matter of days 
on foot. 

When there was nothing but wafting mist and the lapping of the river 
against the boat, Lorcan spoke again. "You wouldn't have stopped that 
dagger." 

She didn't respond, and the silence went on long enough that he turned 
to where she perched on the crate. 

Tears rolled down her face as she stared at the water. 

He didn't know how to comfort, how to soothe--not in the way she 
needed. 

So he set down the pole and sat beside her on the crate, the wood 
groaning. "Who is Manon?" 

He'd heard most of what Vernon had hissed inside that private dining 
room while he'd been setting his trap in the courtyard, but some details had 
evaded him. 

"The Wing Leader of the Ironteeth legion," Elide said, voice trembling, 
the words snagging on the blood clogging her nose. 

Lorcan took a shot in the dark. "She was the one who got you out. That 
day--she was why you're in witch leathers, why you wound up wandering 
in Oakwald." 

A nod. 

"And Kaltan--who was she?" The person who'd given her that thing 
she carried. 

"Erawan's mistress--his slave. She was my age. He put the stone inside 
her arm and made her into a living ghost. She bought me and Manon time 
to run; she incinerated most of Morath in the process, and herself." 


Elide reached into her jacket, her breathing thick with tears still sliding 
down her face. Lorcan's breath caught as she pulled out a scrap of dark 
fabric. 

The scent clinging to it was female, foreign--broken and sad and cold. 
But there was another scent beneath it, one he knew and hated ... 

"Kaltain said to give this to Celaena--not to Aelin," Elide said, shaking 
with her tears. "Because Celaena ... she gave her a warm cloak in a cold 
dungeon. And they wouldn't let Kaltain take the cloak with her when they 
brought her to Morath, but she managed to save this scrap. To remember to 
repay Celaena for that kindness. But ... what sort of gift is this thing? What 
is this?" She pulled back the fold of cloth, revealing a dark sliver of stone. 

Every drop of blood in his body went cold and hot, awake and dead. 

She was sobbing quietly. "Why is this payment? My very bones say to 
not touch it. My--a voice told me not to even think about it ..." 

It was wrong. The thing in her beautiful, filthy hand was wrong. It did 
not belong here, should not be here-- 

The god who had watched over him his whole life had recoiled. 

Even death feared it. 

"Put it away," he said roughly. "Right now." 

Hand shaking, she did so. Only when it was hidden inside her jacket did 
he say, "Let's clean you up first. Set that nose and wrist. I'll tell you what I 
know while I do." 

She nodded, gaze on the river. 

Lorcan reached out, grasping her chin and forcing her to look at him. 
Hopeless, bleak eyes met his. He brushed away a stray tear with his thumb. 
"I made a promise to protect you. I will not break it, Elide." 

She made to pull away, but he gripped her a little harder, keeping her 
eyes on him. 

"I will always find you," he swore to her. 

Her throat bobbed. 

Lorcan whispered, "I promise." 


Elide sifted through all Lorcan had told her while he cleaned her face, 
inspected her nose and wrist, bound the latter in soft cloth, and quickly, but 


not viciously, set her nose. 

Wyrdkeys. Wyrdgates. 

Aelin had one Wyrdkey. Was looking for the other two. 

Soon to be only one more, once Elide gave her the key she carried. 

Two keys--against one. Perhaps they would win this war. 

Even if Elide didn't know how Aelin could use them and not destroy 
herself. But ... she'd leave it up to her. Erawan might have the armies, but 
if Aelin had two keys ... 

She tried not to think about Manon. Vernon had lied about Lorcan 
leaving--to break her spirit, to get her to come willingly. Perhaps Manon 
was not dead, either. 

She wouldn't believe it until she had proof. Until the whole world 
screamed at her that the Wing Leader was gone. 

Lorcan was back at the prow by the time she'd changed into one of his 
own shirts while her leathers dried. Her wrist throbbed, a dull, insistent 
ache, her face was no better and Lorcan had promised she'd likely have a 
black eye from it, but ... her head was clear. 

She came up beside him, watching him push the pole against the mucky 
bottom of the river. "I killed those things." 

"You did a fine job of it," he said. 

"I don't regret it." 

Dark, depthless eyes slid to her. "Good." 

She didn't know why she said it, why she felt a need or like it was 
worth anything to him at all, but Elide stood on her toes, kissed his stubble- 
rough cheek, and said, "I will always find you, too, Lorcan." 

She felt him staring at her, even when she'd climbed into bed minutes 
later. 

When she awoke, clean strips of linen for her cycle were next to the 
bed. 

His own shirt, washed and dried overnight--now cut up for her to use 
as she would. 


AS 1E 


Eyllwe's coast was burning. 

For three days, they sailed past village after village. Some still burning, 
some only cinders. And at each of them, Aelin and Rowan had labored to 
put out those flames. 

Rowan, in his hawk form, could fly in, but ... It killed her. Absolutely 
killed her that they could not afford to halt long enough to go to shore. So 
she did it from the ship, burrowing deep into her power, stretching it as far 
as it could go across sea and sky and sand, to wink out those fires one by 
one. 

By the end of the third day, she was flagging, so thirsty that no amount 
of water was able to slake it, her lips chapped and peeling. 

Rowan had gone to shore three times now to ask who had done it. 

Each time the answer was the same: darkness had swept over them in 
the night, the kind that blotted out the stars, and then the villages were 
burning beneath flaming arrows not spotted until they had found their 
targets. 

But where that darkness, where Erawan's forces were ... there was no 
sign of them. 

No sign of Maeve, either. 

Rowan and Lysandra had flown high and wide, searching for either 
force, but ... nothing. 

Ghosts, some villagers were now claiming, had attacked them. The 
ghosts of their unburied dead, raging home from distant lands. 

Until they started whispering another rumor. 

That Aelin Galathynius herself was burning Eyllwe, village by village. 
For vengeance that they had not aided her kingdom ten years ago. 

No matter that she was putting out the flames. They did not believe 
Rowan when he tried to explain who soothed their fires from aboard the 


distant ship. 

He told her not to listen, not to let it sink in. So she tried. 

And it had been during one of those times that Rowan had run his 
thumb over the scar on her palm, leaning to kiss her neck. He'd breathed 
her in, and she knew he detected an answer to the question that had caused 
him to flee that morning on the ship. No, she was not carrying his child. 

They had only discussed the matter once--last week. When she'd 
crawled off him, panting and coated in sweat, and he'd asked if she was 
taking a tonic. She merely told him no. 

He'd gone still. 

And then she had explained that if she'd inherited so much of Mab's 
Fae blood, she might very well have inherited the Fae's struggle to 
conceive. And even if the timing was horrible ... if this was to be the one 
shot she had of providing Terrasen a bloodline, a future ... she would not 
waste it. His green eyes turned distant, but he'd nodded, kissing her 
shoulder. And that had been that. 

She hadn't mustered the nerve to ask if he wanted to sire her children. If 
he wanted to have children, given what had happened to Lyria. 

And during that brief moment before he'd flown back to shore to put 
out more flames, she hadn't possessed the nerve to explain why she'd 
hurled her guts up that morning, either. 

The past three days had been a blur. From the moment Fenrys had 
uttered those words, Nameless is my price, everything had been a blur of 
smoke and flame and waves and sun. 

But as the sun set on the third day, Aelin again shoved those thoughts 
away as the escort ship began signaling ahead, the crew frantically working 
to drop anchor. 

Sweat beaded on her brow, her tongue parchment-dry. But she forgot 
her thirst, her exhaustion, as she beheld what Rolfe's men had spied 
moments ago. 

A flat, waterlogged land under a cloudy sky spread inland as far as the 
eye could see. Moldy green and bone-white grasses crusted the bumps and 
hollows, little islands of life among the mirror-smooth gray water between 
them. And among them all, jutting up from brackish water and humped land 
like the limbs of an ill-buried corpse ... ruins. Great, crumbling ruins, a 
once-lovely city drowned on the plain. 


The Stone Marshes. 


Manon let the humans and Fae meet with the captains of the other two 
ships. 

She heard the news soon enough: what they sought lay about a day and 
a half inland. Precisely where, they didn't know--or how long it'd take to 
find its exact location. Until they returned, the ships would remain anchored 
here. 

And Manon, it seemed, would join them on their trip inland. As if the 
queen suspected that if she were left behind, their little fleet would not be 
intact when they returned. 

Clever woman. 

But that was the other problem. The one facing Manon right now, 
already looking anxious and put-out. 

Abraxos's tail lashed a bit, the iron spikes scraping and scratching the 
pristine ship deck. As if he'd heard the queen's order a minute ago: the 
wyvern has to go. 

On the flat, open expanse of the marshes, he'd be too noticeable. 

Manon placed a hand on his scarred snout, meeting those depthless 
black eyes. "You need to lie low somewhere." 

A warm, sorrowful huff into her palm. 

"Don't whine about it," Manon said, even as something twisted and 
roiled in her belly. "Stay out of sight, keep alert, and come back in four 
days' time." She allowed herself to lean forward, resting her brow against 
his snout. His growl rumbled her bones. "We've been a pair, you and I. A 
few days is nothing, my friend." 

He nudged her head with his own. 

Manon swallowed hard. "You saved my life. Many times. I never 
thanked you for it." 

Abraxos let out another low whine. 

"You and me," she promised him. "From now until the Darkness claims 
us." 

She made herself pull away. Made herself stroke his snout just once 
more. Then backed a step. Then another. "Go." 


He didn't move. She bared her iron teeth. "Go." 

Abraxos gave her a look full of reproach, but his body tensed, wings 
lifting. 

And Manon decided she had never hated anyone more than she hated 
the Queen of Terrasen and her friends. For making him leave. For causing 
this parting, when so many dangers had not been able to cleave them. 

But Abraxos was airborne, the sails groaning in the wind of his wings, 
and Manon watched until he was a speck on the horizon, until the longboats 
were being readied to bring them to the high grasses and stagnant gray 
water of the marshes beyond. 

The queen and her court readied, donning weapons like some people 
adorned themselves with jewelry, moving about in question and answer to 
one another. So similar, to her Thirteen--similar enough that she had to turn 
away, ducking into the shadows of the foremast and schooling her breathing 
into an even rhythm. 

Her hands trembled. Asterin was not dead. The Thirteen were not dead. 

She'd kept the thoughts about it at bay. But now, with that flower- 
smelling wyvern vanishing over the horizon ... 

The last piece of the Wing Leader had vanished with him. 

A muggy wind tugged her inland--toward those marshes. Dragging her 
red cape with it. 

Manon ran a finger down the crimson cloak she'd made herself wear 
this morning. 

Rhiannon. 

She'd never heard a whisper that the Crochan royal bloodline had 
walked off that final killing field five centuries ago. She wondered if any of 
the Crochans beyond her half sister knew the child of Lothian Blackbeak 
and a Crochan Prince had survived. 

Manon unfastened the brooch clasping the cloak at her shoulders. She 
weighed the thick bolt of red fabric in her hands. 

A few easy swipes of her nails had her clutching a long, thin strip of the 
cloak. A few more motions had her tying it around the end of her braid, the 
red stark against the moon white of her hair. 

Manon stepped out of the shadows behind the foremast and peered over 
the edge of the ship. 


No one commented when she dumped her half sister's cloak into the 
sea. 

The wind carried it a few feet over the waves before it fluttered like a 
dying leaf to land atop the swells. A pool of blood--that's how it looked 
from the distance as the tide carried it out, out, out into the ocean. 

She found the King of Adarlan and Queen of Terrasen waiting at the 
railing of the main deck, their companions climbing into the awaiting 
longboat bobbing on the waves. 

She met eyes of sapphire, then those of turquoise and gold. 

She knew they'd seen it. Perhaps not understood what the cloak had 
meant, but ... understood the gesture for what it was. 

Manon flicked her iron teeth and nails back into their slits as she 
approached them. 

Aelin Galathynius said quietly, "You never stop seeing their faces." 

It was only when they were rowing for the shore, spindrift soaking 
them, that Manon realized the queen hadn't meant the Thirteen. And Manon 
wondered if Aelin, too, had watched that cloak floating out to sea and 
thought it looked like spilled blood. 


52 


They didn't get to Leriba. Or to Banjali. They didn't even get close. 

Lorcan felt the push on his shoulder that had guided and shaped the 
course of his life--that invisible, insistent hand of shadow and death. So 
they went south, then west, sailing swiftly down the network of waterways 
through Eyllwe. 

Elide didn't object or question when he explained that if Hellas himself 
was nudging him, that the queen they hunted was likely in that direction. 
Wherever it would lead. There were no cities out there, only endless 
grasslands that skirted Oakwald's southernmost tip, then marshes. The 
abandoned peninsula full of ruins among the marshes. 

But if that was where he was told to go ... The dark god's touch on his 
shoulder had never steered him wrong. So he'd see what he'd find. 

He did not let himself dwell too long on the fact that Elide carried a 
Wyrdkey. That she was trying to bring it to his enemy. Perhaps his power's 
summons would lead them both to 1t--to her. 

And then he'd have two keys, if he played his cards right. 

If he was smarter and faster and more ruthless than the others. 

Then the most dangerous part of all: traveling with two keys in his 
possession, into the heart of Morath, to hunt down the third. Speed would 
be his best ally and only shot at survival. 

And he'd likely never see Elide or any of the others again. 

They'd at last abandoned their barge that morning, cramming whatever 
supplies would fit into their packs before setting off through the rippling 
grasses. Hours later, Elide's breathing was ragged as they ascended a steep 
hill deep in the plain. He'd been scenting brine for two days now--they had 
to be close to the edge of the marshes. Elide swallowed hard, and he passed 
her the canteen as they crested the summit of the hill. 

But Elide halted, arms slackening at her sides. 


And Lorcan himself froze at what spread before them. 

"What is this place?" Elide breathed, as if fearful the land itself would 
hear. 

As far as the eye could see, flowing into the horizon, the land had sunk 
a good thirty feet--a severe, brutal crack from the edge of the cliff, not hill, 
on which they stood, as if some furious god had stomped a foot across the 
plain and left an imprint. 

Silvery brackish water covered most of it, still as a mirror, interrupted 
only by grassy islands and mounds of earth--and crumbling, exquisite 
ruins. 

"This is a bad place," Elide whispered. "We shouldn't be here." 

Indeed, the hair on his arms had risen, every instinct on alert as he 
scanned the marshes, the ruins, the brambles, and thick foliage that had 
choked some of the islands. 

Even the god of death halted his nudging and ducked behind Lorcan's 
shoulder. 

"What do you sense?" 

Her lips were bloodless. "Silence. Life, but such ... silence. As if..." 

"As if what?" he pushed. 

Her words were a shudder of breath. "As if all the people who once 
lived here, long ago, are still trapped inside--still ... beneath." She pointed 
to a ruin--a curved, broken dome of what had likely been a ballroom 
attached to the spire. A palace. "I don't think this is a place for the living, 
Lorcan. The beasts in these waters ... I do not think they tolerate 
trespassers. Nor do the dead." 

"Is it the stone or the goddess who watches you telling you such 
things?" 

"It's my heart that murmurs a warning. Anneith is silent. I don't think 
she wants to be anywhere near. I don't think she will follow." 

"She came to Morath, but not here?" 

"What is inside these marshes?" she asked instead. "Why is Aelin 
headed into them?" 

That, it seemed, was the question. For if they picked up on it, surely the 
queen and Whitethorn would sense it, too--and only a great reward or 
threat would drive them here. 


"I don't know," he admitted. "No towns or outposts exist anywhere 
nearby." Yet this was where the dark god had led him--and where that hand 
still pushed him to venture, even if it quaked. 

Nothing but ruins and dense foliage on those too-small islands of safety 
from whatever dwelled beneath the glassy water. 

But Lorcan obeyed the nudging god at his shoulder and led the Lady of 
Perranth onward. 


"Who lived here?" Elide asked, staring at the weather-worn face of the 
statue jutting from a near-collapsed stone wall. It teetered on the outer edge 
of the little island they were standing on, and the moss-speckled woman 
carved there had no doubt once been beautiful, as well as a bit of support 
for beams and a roof that had since rotted away. But the veil she'd been 
carved wearing now seemed like a death shroud. Elide shivered. 

"This place was forgotten and wrecked centuries before I was even 
born," Lorcan said. 

"Did it belong to Eyllwe?" 

"It was a part of a kingdom that is now gone, a lost people who 
wandered and merged with those of different lands." 

"They must have been very talented, to have made such beautiful 
buildings." 

Lorcan grunted in agreement. It had been two days of inching across the 
marshes--no sign of Aelin. They had slept in the shelter of the ruins, 
though neither of them really got true rest. Elide's dreams had been filled 
with the pale, milky-eyed faces of people she'd never met, crying out in 
supplication as water shoved down their throats, their noses. Even waking, 
she could see them, hear their cries on the wind. 

Just the breeze through the stones, Lorcan grumbled that first day. 

But she'd seen it in his eyes. He heard the dead, too. 

Heard the thunder of the cataclysm that had dropped the land right from 
underneath them, heard the rushing water that devoured them all before 
they could run. Curious beasts from sea and swamp and river had 
converged in the years following, making the ruins a hunting ground, 


feasting on one another when the waterlogged corpses ran out. Changing, 
adapting--growing fatter and cleverer than their ancestors had been. 

It was thanks to those beasts that it took so long to cross the marshes. 
Lorcan would scan the too-still water between those islands of safety. 
Sometimes it was clear to wade through the chest-deep, salty water. 
Sometimes it was not. 

Sometimes even the islands were not safe. Twice now, she'd spotted a 
long, scaled tail--plated like armor--sliding behind a stone wall or broken 
pillar. Thrice, she'd seen great golden eyes, slitted down the pupil, watching 
from the reeds. 

Lorcan had hauled her over a shoulder and run whenever they realized 
they were not alone. 

Then there were the snakes--who liked to dangle from the wraithlike 
trees draining an existence from the islands. And the incessant, biting 
midges, who were nothing compared to the clouds of mosquitoes that 
sometimes hounded them for hours. Or until Lorcan sent a wave of his dark 
power into them and they all dropped to the earth in a dark rain. 

But every time he killed ... she felt the earth shudder. Not in fear of him 
... but as if it were awakening. Listening. 

Wondering who dared walk across it. 

On the fourth night, Elide was so tired, so on edge, she wanted to 
whimper as they curled into a rare sanctuary: a ruined hall, with part of its 
mezzanine intact. It was open to the sky, and vines choked the three walls, 
but the stone stair had been solid--and was high enough off the island that 
nothing might crawl out of the water to prey upon them. Lorcan had rigged 
the base and top of the stairs with trip wires of vines and branches--to alert 
them if any beasts slithered up the steps. 

They didn't dare risk a fire, but it was warm enough that she didn't miss 
one. Lying beside Lorcan, his body a solid wall between her and the stone 
to her left, Elide watched the flickering stars, the drowsy buzz of insects a 
constant drone in her ears. Something roared in the distance. 

The insects paused. The marsh seemed to turn its attention toward that 
feral, deep roar. 

Slowly, life resumed again--though quieter. Lorcan murmured, "Sleep, 
Elide." 

She swallowed, her fear thick in her blood. "What was that?" 





"One of the beasts--either a mating call or territorial warning." 

She didn't want to know how big they were. Glimpses of eyes and tails 
were enough. 

"Tell me about her," Elide whispered. "Your queen." 

"I doubt itll help you sleep any better." 

She turned onto her other side, finding him lying on his back, watching 
the sky. "Will she truly kill you for what you've done?" A nod. "Yet you 
risk it--for her sake." She propped her head up with a fist. "Do you love 
her?" 

Those eyes, darker than the gaps between the stars, slid to her. "I have 
been in love with Maeve since I first laid eyes on her." 

"Are you--are you her lover?" She had not dared ask it, hadn't really 
wanted to know. 

"No. I offered once. She laughed at me for the insolence." His mouth 
tightened. "So I have made myself invaluable in other ways." 

Again, that roar in the distance that silenced the world for a few 
heartbeats. Was it closer, or had she imagined it? When she glanced back at 
him, Lorcan's eyes were on her mouth. 

She said, "Perhaps she uses your love to her own advantage. Perhaps 
it's in her best interest to drag you along. Maybe she'll change her mind 
when you seem the most likely to ... leave." 

"T am blood-sworn to her. I will never leave." 

Her chest hurt at that. "Then she can rest assured knowing you'll pine 
after her for eternity." 

The words came out sharper than she intended, and she made to look at 
the stars, but Lorcan gripped her chin, faster than she could detect. He 
peered into her eyes, scanning them. "Do not make the mistake of believing 
me to be a romantic fool. I do not hold any shred of hope for her." 

"Then that does not seem like love at all." 

"And what do you know of love?" He was so close--had neared 
without her realizing it. 

"I think love should make you happy," Elide said, remembering her 
mother and father. How often they had smiled and laughed, how they had 
gazed at each other. "It should make you into the best possible version of 
yourself." 

"Are you implying I am neither of those things?" 


"I don't think you even know what happiness is." 

His face grew grave--thoughttful. "I do not mind ... being around you." 

"Is that a compliment?" 

A half smile cut across his granite-hewn face. And she wanted ... 
wanted to touch it. That smile, that mouth. With her fingers, her own lips. It 
made him younger, made him ... handsome. 

So she reached up with trembling fingers and touched his lips. 

Lorcan froze, still half above her, his eyes solemn and intent. 

But she traced the contours of his mouth, finding the skin there soft and 
warm, such a contrast to the harsh words that usually came out of it. 

She reached the outer corner of his lips, and he turned his face into her 
hand, resting his rough cheek against her palm. His eyes grew heavy-lidded 
as she brushed a thumb over the hard plane of his cheekbone. 

Elide whispered, "I would hide you. In Perranth. If you ... if you do 
what you need to do, and need somewhere to go ... You would have a place 
there. With me." 

His eyes snapped open, but there was nothing hard, nothing cold, about 
the light shining in them. "I would be a dishonored male--it'd reflect 
poorly upon you." 

"If anyone thinks that, they would have no place in Perranth." 

His throat bobbed. "Elide, you need to--" 

But she rose up slightly, replacing her mouth where her fingers had 
been. 

The kiss was soft, and quiet, and brief. Barely a grazing of her lips 
against his. 

She thought Lorcan might have been trembling as she pulled back. As 
heat bloomed across her cheeks. But she made herself say, surprised to find 
her voice steady, "You don't need to answer me now. Or ever. You could 
show up on my doorstep in ten years, and the offer would still stand. But 
there is a place for you, in Perranth--if you should ever need or wish for 
it." 

Something like agony rippled in his eyes, the most human expression 
she'd seen him make. 

But he leaned forward, and despite the marshes, despite what gathered 
in the world, for the first time in ten years, Elide found herself not at all 


afraid as Lorcan caressed her lips with his own. Not afraid of anything as he 
did it again, kissing one corner of her mouth, then the other. 

Such gentle, patient kisses--his hands equally so as they stroked the 
hair back from her brow, as they trailed over her hips, her ribs. She lifted 
her own hands to his face and dragged her fingers into his silken hair as she 
arched up into him, craving the weight of his body on hers. 

Lorcan's tongue brushed against the seam of her mouth, and Elide 
marveled at how natural it felt to open for him, how her body sang at the 
contact, his hardness against her softness. Lorcan groaned at the first caress 
of his tongue against her own, his hips grinding against hers in a way that 
made heat scorch through her, made her own body undulate against his in 
answer and demand. 

He kissed her deeper at that request, a hand sliding down to grip her 
thigh, spreading her legs a bit wider so he could settle fully between them. 
And as all of him lined up with her ... She was panting, she realized, as she 
ground herself against him, as Lorcan tore his mouth from hers and kissed 
her jaw, her neck, her ear. She was trembling--not with fear, but with want 
as Lorcan breathed her name over and over onto her skin. 

Like a prayer, that was how her name sounded on his lips. She took his 
face in her hands, finding his eyes blazing, his breathing as ragged as her 
own. 

Elide dared to run her fingers from his cheek down his neck, right 
beneath the collar of his shirt. His skin was like heated silk. He shuddered 
at the touch, head bowing so that his inky hair spilled onto her brow, and his 
hips drove into hers just enough that a small gasp came out of her. More, 
she realized--she wanted more. 

His eyes met hers in silent question, her hand pausing over the skin 
above his heart. It was a raging, thunderous beat. 

She lifted her head to kiss him, and as her mouth again met his, she 
whispered her answer-- 

Lorcan's head snapped up. He was instantly on his feet, whirling toward 
the northeast. 

Where a darkness had begun to spread across the stars, wiping them out 
one by one. 

Any bit of heat, of desire, winked out of her. 

"Ts that a storm?" 


"We need to run," Lorcan said. But it was the dead of the night--dawn 
was at least six hours off. To cross the marshes now ... More and more stars 
were gobbled up by that gathering darkness. 

"What is that?" It spread farther with each heartbeat. Far out, even the 
marsh beasts stopped roaring. 

"Tken," Lorcan murmured. "That is an army of ilken." 

Elide knew they weren't coming for her. 


A530 


Two days into the endless labyrinth of the Stone Marshes--two, not the day 
and a half that gods-damned Rolfe had suggested--Aelin was inclined to 
burn the whole place to the ground. With the water and humidity, she was 
never dry, always sweating and sticky. And worse: the insects. 

She kept the little demons away with a shield of invisible flame, 
revealed only by the zinging as they slammed into it. She might have felt 
bad, had they not tried to eat her alive the first day here. Had she not 
scratched at the dozens of swollen red bites until her skin bled--and Rowan 
stepped in to heal them. 

After the Bloodhound's attack, her own healing abilities had remained 
depleted. So Rowan and Gavriel played healer for all of them, tending to 
the itching bites, the welts from stinging plants, the scratches from 
submerged, jagged chunks of the ruins that sliced into them if they weren't 
careful while wading through the brackish water. 

Only Manon seemed immune to the marshes' drain, finding the feral, 
rotting beauty of the marshes to be pleasing. She indeed reminded Aelin of 
one of the horrid river beasts that ruled this place--with those golden eyes, 
those sharp, gleaming teeth ... Aelin tried not to think on it too much. Tried 
to imagine getting out of this place and onto dry, crisp land. 

But in the heart of this dead, wretched sprawl was Mala's Lock. 

Rowan was scouting ahead in hawk form as the sun inched toward the 
horizon, Lysandra surveying the waters between the small hills as some 
slimy, scaled marsh thing that Aelin had grimaced at, eliciting an indignant 
hiss of a forked tongue before the shifter splashed into the water. 

Aelin grimaced again as she trudged up one of those little hills, crusted 
in thorny brambles and crowned with two fallen pillars. A maze designed to 
scratch and stub and tear. 


So she sent a blast of fire across the hill, turning it to wilting ashes. It 
clung to her wet boots as she passed over it, a sodden gray mush. 

Fenrys chuckled at her side as they descended the hill. "Well, that's one 
way to get through it." He held out a hand to lead her through the water, and 
part of her balked at the idea of being escorted, but ... she'd be damned if 
she fell into a watery pit. She had a very, very good idea of what was deep 
beneath them. She had no interest in swimming among the rotted remnants 
of people. 

Fenrys gripped her hand tightly as they waded through the chest-deep 
water. He hauled her onto the bank first, then climbed out himself. He could 
no doubt leap the gaps between the islands in wolf form, as could Gavriel. 
Why they bothered staying in Fae form was beyond her. 

Aelin used her magic to dry off as best she could, then used a tendril to 
dry Fenrys's and Gavriel's clothes, too. 

A harmless, casual expenditure of power. Even if using it for three days 
straight on Eyllwe's burning coast had drained her. Not the flame, but just 
... physically. Mentally. She still felt like she could sleep for a week. But 
the magic murmured. Incessantly, relentlessly. Even if she was tired ... the 
power demanded more. Drying their clothes between dips into the marsh 
water, at least, kept the damn thing quiet. For now. 

Lysandra popped her hideous head up from a tangle of brambles, and 
Aelin yelped, falling back a step. The shifter grinned, revealing two very, 
very sharp fangs. Fenrys loosed a low laugh, scanning the shifter as she 
slithered a few feet ahead. "So you can change skin and bone, but the brand 
remains?" 

Lysandra paused a few inches from the water, and on the island ahead, 
Aedion seemed to go tense, even as he continued on. Good. At least she 
wasn't the only one who'd rip out anyone's throat if they so much as 
mocked Lysandra. But her friend shifted, glowing and expanding, until her 
form became humanoid--Fae. 

Until Fenrys was looking at himself, albeit a smaller version to fit into 
the woman's clothes. Gavriel, clearing the bank behind them, stumbled a 
step at the sight. 

Lysandra said, her voice near-identical to Fenrys's drawl, "I suppose it 
shall always be my tell." She extended her wrist, pushing back the sleeve of 
her jacket to reveal his golden-brown skin, marred with that brand. 


But she kept peering down at herself as they all continued wading and 
climbing, and finally remarked, "Your hearing is better." Lysandra ran her 
tongue over the slightly elongated canines. Fenrys cringed a bit. "What's 
the point of these?" she asked. 

Gavriel edged closer and nudged the shape-shifter along, walking a few 
paces ahead with her. "Fenrys is the last person to ask. If you want an 
appropriate answer, that is." 

Lysandra chuckled, smiling at the Lion as they ascended the hill. Odd-- 
to see her smile on Fenrys's face. Fenrys caught Aelin's eye and grimaced 
again, no doubt finding it equally unnerving. She chuckled. 

Wings flapped ahead, and Aelin took a moment to marvel as Rowan 
sailed hard and fast to them. Swift, strong--unfaltering. 

Gavriel fell back a few paces as Lysandra stilled beside Aedion atop the 
hill and shifted into her own form. She swayed a bit, and Aelin lunged-- 
only for Aedion to beat her to it, gripping Lysandra gently under her elbow 
as Rowan landed and shifted himself. They all needed a nice, long rest. 

Her Fae Prince said, "Dead ahead--we'll be there by tomorrow 
afternoon." 

Whenever she saw Rolfe again, they'd have a little chat about how, 
exactly, he calculated distances on that infernal map of his. 

But Rowan's face had paled beneath the tattoos. After a moment, he 
added, "I can feel it--my magic can feel it." 

"Tell me it's not under twenty feet of water." 

A swift, cutting shake of the head. "I didn't want to risk getting too 
close. But it reminds me of the Sin-Eater's temple." 

"So, a really lovely, welcoming, and relaxing place to be, then," she 
said. 

Aedion laughed under his breath, eyes on the horizon. Dorian and 
Manon hauled themselves onto the bank below, dripping wet, the witch 
scanning the sea of islands ahead. If she noted anything, the witch said 
nothing. 

Rowan surveyed the island they stood atop: high, shielded by a 
crumbling stone wall on one side, thorns on the other. "We'll camp here 
tonight. It's secure enough." 

Aelin nearly sagged in relief. Lysandra uttered a faint thank-you to the 
gods. 


Within minutes, they'd cleared enough of a general area, through 
physical and magical toiling, to find seats among the huge blocks of stone, 
and Aedion set about cooking: a rather sad meal of hard bread and the 
swamp creatures Gavriel and Rowan had hunted, deeming them safe 
enough to eat. Aelin didn't watch her cousin, preferring not to know what 
the hell she was about to shove down her throat. 

The others seemed inclined to avert their attention as well, and though 
Aedion managed to wield their meager spices with surprising talent, some 
of the meat was ... chewy. Slimy. Lysandra had politely, but thoroughly, 
gagged at one point. 

Night set in, a sea of stars twinkling into existence. Aelin couldn't recall 
the last time she had been so far from civilization--perhaps on the ocean 
crossing to and from Wendlyn. 

Aedion, seated beside her, passed the too-light skin of wine. She 
swigged from it, glad for the sour slide that washed away any lingering 
taste of the meat. 

"Don't ever tell me what that was," Aelin murmured to him, watching 
the others quietly finish up their own food. Lysandra muttered her 
agreement. 

Aedion grinned a bit wickedly, surveying the others as well. A few feet 
away, half in shadow, Manon monitored it all. But Aedion's gaze lingered 
on Dorian, and Aelin braced herself. But her cousin's smile turned softer. 
"He still eats like a fine lady." 

Dorian's head snapped up--but Aelin bit back a laugh at the memory. 
Ten years ago, they'd sat around a table together and she'd told the 
Havilliard prince what she thought of his table manners. Dorian blinked as 
the memory no doubt resurfaced, even as the others glanced between them. 

The king gave a magnanimous bow. "I'll take that as a compliment." 
Indeed, his hands were mostly clean, his now-dry clothes immaculate. 

Her own hands ... Aelin fished into a pocket for her handkerchief. The 
thing was as filthy as the rest of her, but ... better than using her pants. She 
plucked out the Eye of Elena from where it was usually wrapped inside, 
setting it on her knee as she wiped the smear of spices and fat from her 
fingers, then offered the scrap of silk to Lysandra. Aelin casually ran her 
fingers over the bent metal of the Eye as the shifter cleaned her hands, the 
blue stone in its core flickering with cobalt fire. 


"As far as I recall," Dorian went on with a sly grin, "you two--" 

The attack happened so fast that Aelin didn't sense or see it until 1t was 
over. 

One moment, Manon was seated at the edge of the fire, the marshes a 
dark sprawl behind her. 

The next, scales and flashing white teeth were snapping for her, erupting 
from the brush on the bank. And then--stillness and silence as the 
enormous marsh beast froze in place. 

Halted by invisible hands--strong ones. 

Manon's sword was half out, her breathing ragged as she stared down 
the milky-pink maw spread wide enough to snap off her head. The teeth 
were each as long as Aelin's thumb. 

Aedion swore. The others didn't so much as move. 

But Dorian's magic held the beast still, frozen with no ice to be seen. 
The same power as the one he'd wielded against the Bloodhound. Aelin 
surveyed him for any tether, any gleaming thread of power, and found none. 
He hadn't even lifted a hand to direct it. Interesting. 

Dorian said to Manon, the witch still peering into the yawning death 
inches before her face, "Shall I kill it or set it free?" 

Aelin most certainly had an opinion on the matter, but a warning look 
from Rowan had her shutting her mouth. And gaping a bit at her prince. 

Oh, you crafty old bastard. His harsh, tattooed face revealed nothing. 

Manon glanced toward Dorian. "Free it." 

The king's face tightened--then the beast went careening off into the 
dark, as if a god had hurled it across the marshes. A distant splash sounded. 

Lysandra sighed. "Aren't they beautiful?" 

Aelin cut her a look. The shifter grinned. 

But Aelin looked back at Rowan, holding his stare. How convenient that 
your shield vanished right as that thing waddled up. What an excellent 
opportunity for a magic lesson. What if it had gone wrong? 

Rowan's eyes glittered. Why do you think the hole opened up by the 
witch? 

Aelin swallowed her laugh of dismay. But Manon Blackbeak was taking 
in the king, her hand still on her sword. Aelin didn't bother to pretend 
looking as if she wasn't watching them as the witch shifted those gold eyes 
to her. To the Eye of Elena still balanced on Aelin's knee. 


Manon's lip curled back from her teeth. "Where did you get that." 

The hair on Aelin's arms rose. "The Eye of Elena? It was a gift." 

But the witch again glanced to Dorian--as if saving her from that thing 

. Oh, Rowan hadn't lowered the shield just for a magic lesson, had he? 
Acin didn't dare glance at him this time, not as Manon dipped her fingers 
into the muddy earth to sketch a shape. 

A large circle--and two overlapping circles, one atop the other, within 
its circumference. "That is the Three-Faced Goddess," Manon said, her 
voice low. "We call this ..." She drew a rough line in the centermost circle, 
in the eye-shaped space where they overlapped. "The Eye of the Goddess. 
Not Elena." She circled the exterior again. "Crone," she said of the 
outermost circumference. She circled the interior top circle: "Mother." She 
circled the bottom: "Maiden." She stabbed the eye inside: "And the heart of 
the Darkness within her." 

It was Aelin's turn to shake her head. The others didn't so much as 
blink. 

Manon said again, "That is an Ironteeth symbol. Blueblood prophets 
have it tattooed over their hearts. And those who won valor in battle, when 
we lived in the Wastes ... they were once given those. To mark our glory-- 
our being Goddess-blessed." 

Aelin debated chucking the gods-damned amulet into the marsh, but 
said, "The day I first saw Baba Yellowlegs ... the amulet turned heavy and 
warm in her presence. I thought it was in warning. Perhaps it was in ... 
recognition." 

Manon studied the necklace of scars marring Aelin's throat. "Its power 
worked even with magic contained?" 

"I was told that certain objects were ... exempt." Aelin's voice strained. 
"Baba Yellowlegs knew the entire history of the Wyrdkeys and gates. She 
was the one who told me about them. Is that a part of your history, too?" 

"No. Not in those terms," Manon said. "But Yellowlegs was an Ancient 
--she knew things now lost to us. She ripped down the walls of the 
Crochan city herself." 

"The legends claim the slaughter was ... catastrophic," Dorian said. 

Shadows flickered in Manon's eyes. "That killing field, the last I heard, 
is still barren. Not a blade of grass grows on it. They say it's from Rhiannon 





Crochan's curse. Or from the blood that soaked it for the final three weeks 
of that war." 

"What is the curse, exactly?" Lysandra asked, brows furrowing. 

Manon examined her iron nails, long enough that Aelin thought she 
wouldn't answer. Aedion chucked the wineskin back into her lap, and Aelin 
swigged from it again as Manon at last replied. "Rhiannon Crochan held the 
gates to her city for three days and three nights against the three Ironteeth 
Matrons. Her sisters were dead around her, her children slaughtered, her 
consort spiked to one of the Ironteeth war caravans. The last Crochan 
Queen, the final hope of their thousand-year dynasty ... She did not go 
gently. It was only when she fell at dawn on the fourth day that the city was 
truly lost. And as she lay dying on that killing field, as the Ironteeth ripped 
down the walls of the city around her and butchered her people ... she 
cursed us. Cursed the three Matrons, and through them, all Ironteeth. She 
cursed Yellowlegs herself--who gave Rhiannon her finishing blow." 

None of them moved or spoke or breathed too loudly. 

"Rhiannon swore on her last breath that we would win the war, but not 
the land. That for what we had done, we would inherit the land only to see 
it wilt and die in our hands. Our beasts would shrivel and keel over dead; 
our witchlings would be stillborn, poisoned by the streams and rivers. Fish 
would rot in lakes before we could catch them. Rabbits and deer would flee 
across the mountains. And the once-verdant Witch Kingdom would become 
a wasteland. 

"The Ironteeth laughed at it, drunk on Crochan blood. Until the first 
Ironteeth witchling was born--dead. And then another and another. Until 
the cattle rotted in the fields, and the crops withered overnight. By the end 
of the month, there was no food. By the second, the three Ironteeth Clans 
were turning on one another, ripping themselves to pieces. So the Matrons 
ordered us all into exile. Separated the Clans to cross the mountains and 
wander as we would. Every few decades, they would send groups to try to 
work the land, to see if the curse still held. Those groups never returned. We 
have been wanderers for five hundred years--the wound made worse by the 
fact that humans eventually took it for themselves. And the land responded 
to them." 

"But you plan to return to it still?" Dorian asked. 


Those golden eyes were not of this earth. "Rhiannon Crochan said there 
was one way--only one--to break the curse." Manon swallowed and 
recited in a cold, tight voice, "Blood to blood and soul to soul, together this 
was done, and only together it can be undone. Be the bridge, be the light. 
When iron melts, when flowers spring from fields of blood--let the land be 
witness, and return home." Manon toyed with the end of her braid, the scrap 
of red cloak she'd tied around it. "Every Ironteeth witch in the world has 
pondered that curse. For five centuries, we have tried to break it." 

"And your parents ... their union was made in order to break this 
curse?" Aelin pushed--carefully. 

A sharp nod. "I did not know--that Rhiannon's bloodline survived." 
And now ran through Manon's blue veins. 

Dorian mused, "Elena predates the witch wars by a millennium. The 
Eye had nothing to do with that." He rubbed his neck. "Right?" 

Manon didn't reply, only extending a foot to wipe away the symbol 
she'd traced in the dirt. 

Aelin drained the rest of the wine and shoved the Eye back into her 
pocket. "Maybe now you understand," she said to Dorian, "why I've found 
Elena just a bit difficult to deal with." 


The island was wide enough that a conversation could be had without being 
overheard. 

Rowan supposed that was precisely what his former cadre wanted as 
they found him on watch atop the vine-choked, crumbling spiral stairwell 
that overlooked the island and its surroundings. Leaning against a section 
that had once been the curving wall, Rowan demanded, "What?" 

Gavriel said, "You should take Aelin a thousand miles from here. 
Tonight." 

A wave of his magic and honed instincts told him all was safe in the 
immediate vicinity, calming the killing rage he'd slipped into at the thought. 

Fenrys said, "Whatever awaits us tomorrow, it has been waiting for a 
long time, Rowan." 

"And how do either of you know this?" 


Gavriel's tawny eyes gleamed animal-bright in the darkness. "Your 
beloved's life and the witch's are entwined. They have been led here, by 
forces even we cannot understand." 

"Think about it,' Fenrys pushed. "Two females whose paths crossed 
tonight in a way we've rarely witnessed. Two queens, who might control 
either half of this continent, two sides of one coin. Both half-breeds. 
Manon, an Ironteeth and a Crochan. Aelin ..." 

"Human and Fae," Rowan finished for him. 

"Between them, they cover the three main races of this earth. Between 
the two of them, they are mortal and immortal; one worships fire, the other 
Darkness. Do I need to go on? It feels as if we're playing right into the 
hands of whoever has been running this game--for eons." 

Rowan gave Fenrys a stare that usually had men backing away. Even as 
he considered it. 

Gavriel interrupted to say, "Maeve has been waiting, Rowan. Since 
Brannon. For someone who would lead her to the keys. For your Aelin." 

Maeve had not mentioned the Lock this spring. She hadn't mentioned 
Mala's ring, either. Rowan said slowly, his words a death promise, "Did 
Maeve send you because of this Lock, too?" 

"No," Fenrys said. "No--she never mentioned that." He shifted on his 
feet, turning toward a distant, brutal roar. "If Maeve and Aelin go to war, 
Rowan, if they meet on a battlefield ..." 

He tried not to let himself imagine it. The cataclysmic carnage and 
destruction. 

Perhaps they should have remained in the North, shoring up their 
defenses. 

Fenrys breathed, "Maeve will not allow herself to lose. Already, she's 
replaced you." 

Rowan whirled on Gavriel. "Who." 

Those lion's eyes darkened. "Cairn." 

Rowan's blood iced over, colder than his magic. "Is she insane?" 

"She told us of his promotion a day before we left. He was grinning like 
a cat with a canary in its mouth as we walked out of the palace." 

"He's a sadist." Cairn ... No amount of training, both off the battlefield 
and on it, had ever broken the Fae warrior of his penchant for cruelty. 
Rowan had locked him up, flogged him, disciplined him, wielded whatever 


shred of compassion he could muster in himself ... nothing. Cairn had been 
born savoring the suffering of others. 

So Rowan had kicked him out of his own army--dumped him into 
Lorcan's lap. Cairn had lasted about a month with Lorcan before he was 
packed off to an isolated legion, commanded by a general who was not 
cadre and had no interest in being one. The tales of what Cairn did to the 
soldiers and innocents he encountered ... 

There were few laws against murder with the Fae. And Rowan had 
considered sparing the world of Cairn's vileness every time he'd seen him. 
For Maeve to appoint him to the cadre, to give him almost unchecked 
power and influence-- 

"I'd bet every bit of gold I have that she's going to let Aelin nearly 
break herself destroying Erawan ... then strike when she's weakest," Fenrys 
mused. 

For Maeve not to have given either male a gag order through the blood 
oath ... She wanted him--wanted Aelin--to have this knowledge. To worry 
and speculate. 

Fenrys and Gavriel swapped wary glances. "We still serve her, Rowan," 
Gavriel murmured. "And we still have to kill Lorcan when the time comes." 

"Why bring this up at all? I won't get in your way. Neither will Aelin, 
believe me." 

"Because," Fenrys said, "Maeve's style isn't to execute. It's to punish-- 
slowly. Over years. But she wants Lorcan dead. And not half dead, or throat 
slit, but irrevocably dead." 

"Beheaded and burned," Gavriel said grimly. 

Rowan loosed a breath. "Why?" 

Fenrys cast his glance over the edge of the stairs--to where Aelin slept, 
her golden hair shining in the moonlight. "Lorcan and you are the most 
powerful males in the world." 

"You forget Lorcan and Aelin can't even stand to be in the same 
breathing space. I doubt there's a chance of an alliance between them." 

"All we're saying," Fenrys explained, "is that Maeve does not make 
decisions without considerable motive. Be ready for anything. Sending her 
armada, wherever it is, is only the start." 

The marsh beasts roared, and Rowan wanted to roar right back. If Aelin 
and Cairn ever encountered each other, if Maeve had some plan beyond her 


greed for the keys ... 

Aelin turned in her sleep, scowling at the ruckus, Lysandra dozing 
beside her in ghost leopard form, that fluffy tail twitching. Rowan pushed 
off the wall, more than ready to join his queen. But he found Fenrys staring 
at her as well, his face tight and drawn. Fenrys's voice was a broken 
whisper as he said, "Kill me. If that order is given. Kill me, Rowan, before I 
have to do it." 

"You'll be dead before you can get within a foot of her." 

Not a threat--a promise and a plain statement of fact. Fenrys's 
shoulders slumped in thanks. 

"I'm glad, you know," Fenrys said with unusual graveness, "that I got 
this time. That Maeve unintentionally gave me that. That I got to know 
what it was like--to be here, as a part of this." 

Rowan didn't have words, so he looked to Gavriel. 

But the Lion was merely nodding as he stared down at the little camp 
below. At his sleeping son. 





"AS4E 


The last leg of the trek the next morning was the longest yet, Manon 
thought. 

Close--so close to this Lock the queen with a witch emblem in her 
pocket was seeking. 

She'd fallen asleep, pondering how it could be connected, but gleaned 
nothing. They'd all been awake before dawn, dragged to consciousness by 
the oppressive humidity, so heavy it felt like a blanket weighing on 
Manon's shoulders. 

The queen was mostly quiet from where she walked at the head of their 
company, her mate scouting overhead, and her cousin and the shape-shifter 
flanking her, the latter wearing the skin of a truly horrific swamp viper. The 
Wolf and the Lion brought up the rear, sniffing and listening for anything 
wrong. 

The people who had once dwelled within these lands had not met easy 
or pleasant ends. She could feel their pain even now, whispering through 
the stones, rippling through the water. That marsh beast that had snuck up 
on her last night was the mildest of the horrors here. At her side, Dorian 
Havilliard's tense tan face seemed to suggest he felt the same. 

Manon waded waist-deep through a pool of warm, thick water and 
asked, if only to get it out of where it rattled in her skull, "How will she use 
the keys to banish Erawan and his Valg? Or, for that matter, get rid of the 
things he's created that aren't of his original realm, but are some hybrid?" 

Sapphire eyes slid toward her. "What?" 

"Is there a way of weeding out who belongs and who doesn't? Or will 
all those with Valg blood"--she put a hand on her sodden chest--"be sent 
into that realm of darkness and cold?" 

Dorian's teeth gleamed as he clenched them. "I don't know," he 
admitted, watching Aelin nimbly hop over a stone. "If she does, I assume 


she' ll tell us when it's most convenient for her." 

And the least convenient for them, he didn't need to add. 

"And she gets to decide, I suppose? Who stays and who goes." 

"Banishing people to live with the Valg isn't something Aelin would 
willingly do." 

"But she does decide, ultimately." 

Dorian paused atop a little hill. "Whoever holds those keys gets to 
decide. And you'd better pray to whatever wicked gods you worship that 
it's Aelin holding them in the end." 

"What about you?" 

"Why should I wish to go anywhere near those things?" 

"You're as powerful as she is. You could wield them. Why not?" 

The others were swiftly pulling ahead, but Dorian remained still. Even 
had the audacity to grip her wrist--hard. "Why not?" There was such 
unyielding coldness in that beautiful face. She couldn't turn away from it. A 
hot, humid breeze shoved past, dragging her hair with it. The wind didn't 
touch him, didn't ruffle one raven-dark hair on his head. A shield--he was 
shielding himself. Against her, or whatever was in this swamp? He said 
softly, "Because I was the one who did it." 

She waited. 

His sapphire eyes were chips of ice. "I killed my father. I shattered the 
castle. I purged my own court. So if I had the keys, Wing Leader," he 
finished as he released her wrist, "I have no doubt that I would do the same 
once more--across this continent." 

"Why?" she breathed, her blood chilling. 

She was indeed a bit terrified of the icy rage rippling from him as 
Dorian said, "Because she died. And even before she did, this world saw to 
it that she suffered, and was afraid, and alone. And even though no one will 
remember who she was, I do. I will never forget the color of her eyes, or the 
way she smiled. And I will never forgive them for taking it away." 

Too breakable--he'd said of human women. No wonder he'd come to 
her. 

Manon had no answer, and she knew he wasn't looking for one, but she 
said anyway, "Good." 

She ignored the glimmer of relief that flashed across his face as she 
moved ahead. 





Rowan's calculations hadn't been wrong: they reached the Lock by midday. 

Aelin supposed that even if Rowan hadn't scouted ahead, it would have 
been obvious from the moment they beheld the waterlogged, labyrinthine 
complex of wrecked pillars that the Lock likely lay in the half-crumbling 
stone dome in its center. Mostly because everything--every choking weed 
and drop of water--seemed to be leaning away from it. Like the complex 
was the dark, rippling heartbeat of the marshes. 

Rowan shifted as he landed before where they had all gathered on a 
grassy, dry bit of land on the outskirts of the sprawling complex, not even 
missing a step as he walked to her side. She tried not to look too relieved as 
he safely returned. 

She really tortured them, she realized, by shoving her way into danger 
whenever she felt like it. Perhaps she'd try to be better about it, if this dread 
was at all like what they felt. 

"This whole place is too quiet," Rowan said. "I probed the area, but ... 
nothing." 

Aedion drew the Sword of Orynth from across his back. "We'll circle 
the perimeter, making smaller passes until we get up to the building itself. 
No surprises." 

Lysandra stepped back from them, bracing for the shift. "Pll take the 
water--if you hear two roars, get to higher ground. One quick roar, and it's 
clear." 

Aelin nodded in confirmation and order to go ahead. By the time 
Aedion had strode for the outer wall of the complex, Lysandra had slipped 
into the water, all scales and talons. 

Rowan jerked his chin to Gavriel and Fenrys. Both males silently 
shifted and then trotted ahead, the latter joining Aedion, the former in the 
opposite direction. 

Rowan kept to Aelin's side, Dorian and the witch at her back, as they 
waited for the all clear. 

When Lysandra's solitary, swift roar cleaved the air, Aelin murmured to 
Rowan, "What's the catch? Where is the catch? It's too easy." Indeed, there 
was nothing and no one here. No threat beyond what might be rotting away 
in the pits and sinkholes. 





"Believe me, I've been considering it." 

She could almost feel him sliding into that frozen, raging place--where 
born instinct and centuries of training had him seeing the world as a killing 
field, and willing to do anything to eradicate any threats to her. Not just his 
Fae nature--but Rowan's nature. To protect, to shield, to fight for what and 
who he loved. 

Aelin stepped close and kissed him on the neck. Those pine-green eyes 
warmed slightly as they shifted from the ruin to scan her face. 

"When we get back to civilization," he said, his voice deepening as he 
kissed her cheek, her ear, her brow, "I'm going to find you the nicest inn on 
the whole gods-damned continent." 

"Oh?" He kissed her mouth. Once, twice. 

"With good food, a disgustingly comfortable bed, and a big bathtub." 

Even in the marshes, it was easy to become drunk on him, on the taste 
and smell and sound and feel of him. "How big?" she murmured, not caring 
what the others thought as they returned. 

"Big enough for two," he said onto her lips. 

Her blood turned sparkling at the promise. She kissed him once-- 
briefly but deeply. "I have no defenses against such offers. Especially those 
made by such a pretty male." 

He scowled at pretty, nipping at her ear with his canines. "I keep a tally, 
you know, Princess. To remind myself to repay you the next time we're 
alone for all the truly wonderful things you say." 

Her toes curled in her soggy boots. But she patted him on the shoulder, 
looking him over with absolute irreverence, saying as she walked ahead, "I 
certainly hope you make me beg for it." 

His answering growl from behind made heat bloom in her core. 

The feeling lasted for about a minute, however. Within a few turns into 
the maze of crumbling walls and pillars, leaving Dorian to guard the 
entrance and Rowan slipping ahead, Aelin found herself beside the witch-- 
who looked more bored than anything. Fair enough. She'd been dragged 
here, after all. 

Wading as quietly as they could into the towering archways and pillars 
of stone, Rowan signaled from a crossroads ahead. They were getting close. 

Aelin unsheathed Goldryn, Manon drawing her own sword in answer. 


Aelin lifted her brows as she glanced between their two blades. "What's 
your sword called?" 

"Wind-Cleaver." 

Aelin clicked her tongue. "Good name." 

"Yours?" 

"Goldryn." 

A slash of iron teeth as they were bared in a half smile. "Not as good a 
name." 

"Blame my ancestor." She certainly did. For many, many things. 

They reached a crossroads--one leading left, one right. Neither offering 
a hint of the direct path to the center of the ruin. 

Rowan said to Manon, "You go left. Whistle if you find anything." 

Manon stalked off among the stones and water and reeds, shoulders 
tight enough to suggest she hadn't appreciated the order, but she wasn't 
dumb enough to tangle with him. 

Aelin smiled a bit at the thought as she and Rowan continued on. 
Running her free palm over the carved walls they passed, she said casually, 
"That sunrise Mala appeared to you--what, exactly, did she say?" 

He slashed a glance in her direction. "Why?" 

Her heart turned thunderous, and maybe it made her a coward to say it 
now-- 

Rowan gripped her elbow as he read her body, scented her fear and 
pain. "Aelin." 

She braced herself, nothing but stone and water and bramble around 
them, and turned a corner. 

And there it was. 

Even Rowan forgot to demand an answer to what she'd been about to 
tell him as they surveyed the open space flanked by crumbling walls and 
punctuated by fallen pillars. And at its northern end ... "Big surprise," 
Aelin muttered. "There's an altar." 

"It's a chest," Rowan corrected with a half smile. "It's got a lid." 

"Even better," she said, nudging him with an elbow. Yes--yes, she'd 
tell him later. 

The water separating them from the chest was still and silver bright-- 
too murky to see if there was a bottom at all beyond the steps up to the dais. 


Aelin reached for her water magic, hoping it'd whisper of what lay beneath 
that surface, but her flames were burning too loudly. 

Splashing issued across the way, and Manon appeared around an 
opposite wall. Her focus went to the enormous stone chest at the rear of the 
space, the stone cracked and overflowing with weeds and vines. She began 
easing across the water, one step at a time. 

Aelin said, "Don't touch the chest." 

Manon just gave her a long look and kept heading for the dais. 

Trying not to slip on the slick floor, Aelin crossed the space, sloshing 
water over the dais steps as she mounted them, Rowan close behind. 

Manon leaned over the chest to study the lid but did not open it. 
Studying, Aelin realized, the countless Wyrdmarks carved into the stone. 

Nehemia had known how to use the marks. Had been taught them and 
was fluent enough in them to have wielded their power. Aelin had never 
asked how or why or when. 

But here were Wyrdmarks, deep within Eyllwe. 

Aelin stepped up to Manon, examining the lid more closely. "Do you 
know what those are?" 

Manon brushed back her long white hair. "I've never seen such 
markings." 

Aelin examined a few, her memory straining for the translation. "Some 
of these aren't symbols I've encountered before. Some are." She scratched 
her head. "Should we throw a rock at it--see what it does?" she asked, 
twisting to where Rowan peered over her shoulder. 

But a hollow throb of air pulsed around them, silencing the incessant 
buzz of the marshes' inhabitants. And it was that utter silence, the bark of 
surprise from Fenrys, that had Aelin and Manon shifting into flanking, 
defensive positions. As if they'd done this a hundred times before. 

But Rowan had gone still as he scanned the gray skies, the ruins, the 
water. 

"What is it?" Aelin breathed. 

Before her prince could answer, Aelin felt it again. A pulsing, dark wind 
demanding their attention. Not the Valg. No, this darkness was born of 
something else. 

"Lorcan," Rowan breathed, a hand on his sword--but not drawing it. 


"Is that his magic?" Aelin shuddered as that death-kissed wind shoved 
at her. She batted it away as if it were a gnat. It snapped at her in answer. 

"Its his warning signal," Rowan murmured. 

"For what?" Manon asked sharply. 

Rowan was instantly moving, scaling the high walls with ease, even as 
stone crumbled away. He balanced on its top, surveying the land on the 
other side of the wall. 

Then he smoothly climbed back down, his splash as he landed echoing 
off the stones. 

Lysandra slithered around a cluster of weeds and halted with a swift 
thrust of her scaled tail as Rowan said too calmly, "There is an aerial legion 
approaching." 

Manon breathed, "Ironteeth?"' 

"No," Rowan said, meeting Aelin's gaze with an icy steadiness that had 
seen him through centuries of battle. "Ilken." 

"How many?" Aelin's voice turned distant--hollow. 

Rowan's throat bobbed, and she knew he'd been taking in the horizon 
and surrounding lands not for any chance of winning the battle that was 
sure to come, but for any shot at getting her out. Even if the rest of them 
had to buy her time with their own lives. 

"Five hundred." 





"aS SE 


Lorcan's breath singed his throat with every inhalation, but he kept running 
through the marshes, Elide laboring beside him, never complaining, only 
scanning the skies with wide, dark eyes. 

Lorcan sent out another flickering blast of his power. Not toward the 
winged army that raced not too far ahead, but farther--toward wherever 
Whitethorn and his bitch-queen might be in this festering place. If those 
ilken reached them long before Lorcan could arrive, that Wyrdkey the bitch 
carried would be as good as lost. And Elide ... He shut out the thoughts. 

The ilken flew hard and fast, heading toward what had to be the heart of 
the marshes. What the hell had brought the queen out here? 

Elide flagged, and Lorcan gripped her under an elbow to keep her 
upright as she stumbled over a bit of pockmarked stone. Faster. If the ilken 
caught them unawares, if they stole his revenge and that key ... 

Lorcan sent out burst after burst of his power in every direction. 

Keys aside, he didn't want to see the look on Elide's face if the ilken got 
there first. And they found whatever was left of the fire-breather and her 
court. 


There was nowhere to go. 
In the heart of this festering plain, there was nowhere to run, or hide. 
Erawan had tracked them here. Had sent five hundred ilken to retrieve 
them. If the ilken had found them on the sea and in this endless wasteland, 
they'd no doubt be able to find them if they tried hiding among the ruins. 
They were all silent as they gathered on a grassy hill at the edge of the 
ruins, watching that black mass take form. Deep in the ruins behind them, 
the chest still waited. Untouched. 


Aelin knew the Lock couldn't help--other than to waste their time by 
opening its container. Brannon could get in line to complain. 

And Lorcan ... somewhere out there. She'd think on that later. At least 
Fenrys and Gavriel had remained, rather than charging off to fulfill Maeve's 
kill order. 

Rowan said, eyes pinned on those swift, leathery wings far on the 
horizon, "We'll use the ruin to our advantage. Force them to bottleneck in 
key areas." Like a cloud of locusts, the ilken blocked out the clouds, the 
light, the sky. A dull, glazed sort of calm swept over Aelin. 

Eight against five hundred. 

Fenrys quickly tied back his golden hair. "We divide it up, take them 
out. Before they can get close enough. While they're still in the air." He 
tapped his foot on the ground, rolling his shoulders--as if shaking off the 
grip of that blood oath roaring at him to hunt down Lorcan. 

Aelin rasped, ""There's another way." 

"No," was Rowan's response. 

She swallowed hard and lifted her chin. "There is nothing and no one 
out here. The risk of using that key would be minimal--" 

Rowan's teeth flashed as he snarled, "No, and that's final." 

Aelin said too quietly, "You don't give me orders." 

She saw as much as she felt Rowan's temper rise with dizzying speed. 
"You will have to pry that key out of my cold, dead hands." 

He meant it, too--he'd make her kill him before he let her use the key 
in any capacity beyond wielding the Lock. 

Aedion let out a low, bitter laugh. "You wanted to send a message to our 
enemies about your power, Aelin." Closer and closer that army came, and 
Rowan's ice and wind licked at her as he tunneled down into his magic. 
Aedion jerked his chin toward the army approaching. "It seems Erawan sent 
his answer." 

Aelin hissed, "You blame me for this?" 

Aedion's eyes darkened. "We should have stayed in the North." 

"I had no choice, P11 have you remember." 

"You did," Aedion breathed, none of the others, not even Rowan, 
stepping in. "You've had a choice all along, and you opted to flash your 
magic around." 





Aelin knew very well that her eyes were now flickering with flames as 
she took a step toward him. "So I guess the 'you're perfect' stage is over, 
then." 

Aedion's lip curled off his teeth. "This isn't a game. This 1s war, and 
you pushed and pushed Erawan to show his hand. You refused to run your 
schemes by us first, to let us weigh in, when we have fought wars--" 

"Don't you dare pin this on me." Aelin peered inside herself--to the 
power there. Down and down it went, to that pit of eternal fire. 

"This isn't the time," Gavriel offered. 

Aedion threw out a hand in his direction, a silent, vicious order for the 
Lion to shut his mouth. "Where are our allies, Aelin? Where are our 
armies? All we have to show for our efforts is a Pirate Lord who might very 
well change his mind if he hears about this from the wrong lips." 

She held in the words. Time. She had needed time 

"If we're going to stand a chance," Rowan said, "we need to get into 
position." 

Embers sparked at her fingertips. "We do it together." She tried not to 
look offended at their raised brows, their slightly gaping mouths. "Magic 
might not last against them. But steel will." She jerked her chin at Rowan, 
at Aedion. "Plan it." 

So they did. Rowan stepped to her side, a hand on her lower back. The 
only comfort he'd show--when he knew, they both knew, it hadn't been his 
argument to win. He said to the Fae males, "How many arrows?" 

"Ten quivers, fully stocked," Gavriel said, eyeing Aedion as he removed 
the Sword of Orynth from his back and rebuckled it at his side. 

Returned to her human form, Lysandra had drifted to the edge of the 
bank, back stiff as the ilken gathered on the horizon. 

Aelin left the males to sort out their positions and slipped up beside her 
friend. "You don't have to fight. You can stay with Manon--guard the other 
direction." 

Indeed, Manon was already scaling one of the ruin walls, a quiver with 
unnervingly few arrows slung over her back beside Wind-Cleaver. Aedion 
had ordered her to scout the other direction for any nasty surprises. The 
witch had looked ready to debate--until she seemed to realize that, on this 
battlefield at least, she was not the apex predator. 





Lysandra loosely braided her black hair, her golden skin sallow. "I don't 
know how they have done this so many times. For centuries." 

"Honestly, I don't know, either," Aelin said, glancing over a shoulder at 
the Fae males now analyzing the layout of the marshes, the flow of the 
wind, whatever else to use to their advantage. 

Lysandra rubbed at her face, then squared her shoulders. "The marsh 
beasts are easily enraged. Like someone I know." Aelin jabbed the shifter 
with an elbow, and Lysandra snorted, even with the army ahead. "I can rile 
them up--threaten their nests. So that if the ilken land ..." 

"They won't just have us to deal with." Aelin gave her a grim smile. 

But Lysandra's skin was still pale, her breathing a bit shallow. Aelin 
threaded her fingers through the shifter's and squeezed tightly. 

Lysandra squeezed back once before letting go to shift, murmuring, "TIl 
signal when I'm done." 

Aelin just nodded, lingering on the bank for a moment to watch the 
long-legged white bird flap across the marsh--toward that building 
darkness. 

She turned back to the others in time to see Rowan jerk his chin to 
Aedion, Gavriel, and Fenrys. "You three herd them--to us." 

"And you lot?" Aedion said, sizing up her, Rowan, and Dorian. 

"I get the first shot," Aelin said, flames dancing in her eyes. 

Rowan inclined his head. "My lady wants the first shot. She gets the 
first shot. And when they're scattering in a blind panic, we come in." 

Aedion gave her a long look. "Don't miss this time." 

"Asshole," she snapped. 

Aedion's smile didn't reach his eyes as he strode to fetch extra weapons 
from their packs, grabbing a quiver of arrows in either hand, slinging one of 
the longbows across his broad back along with his shield. Manon had 
already stationed herself atop the wall behind them, grunting as she strung 
Aedion's other bow. 

Rowan was saying to Dorian, "Short bursts. Find your targets--the 
center of groups--and use only what magic is necessary. Don't waste it all 
at once. Aim for the heads, if you can." 

"What about once they start landing?" Dorian asked, sizing up the 
terrain. 


"Shield yourself, attack when you can. Keep the wall to your back at all 
times." 

"I won't be his prisoner again." 

Aelin tried to shut out what he'd meant by it. 

But Manon said from the wall above them, an arrow now nocked 
loosely in her bow, "If it comes to that, princeling, P1 kill you before they 
can." 

Aelin hissed, "You will do no such thing." 

Both of them ignored her as Dorian said, "Thank you." 

"None of you are being taken prisoner," Aelin growled, and walked 
away. 

And there would be no second or third shots. 

Only the first shot. Only her shot. 

Perhaps it was time to see how deep that new well of power went. What 
lived inside it. 

Perhaps it was time for Morath to learn to scream. 

Aelin stepped up to the water's edge, then leaped onto the next island of 
grass and stone. Rowan silently came up beside her, meeting her pace for 
pace. It wasn't until they reached the next hill that he angled his face toward 
her, his golden skin stretched taut, his eyes as cold as her own. 

Only that anger was directed at her--perhaps more livid than she'd seen 
him since Mistward. She bared her teeth in a feral, grim smile. "I know, I 
know. Just add suggesting to use the Wyrdkey to that tally of all the horrible 
things I do and say." 

Leathery, massive wings beat the air, and shrieking cries at last began to 
trickle toward them. Her knees quaked, but she clamped down on the fear, 
knowing he could scent it, knowing the others could, too. 

So she willed herself to take another step onto the sodden, reed-laden 
plain--toward that ilken army. They'd be upon them in minutes--less, 
maybe. 

And horrible, miserable Lorcan had bought them that extra time. 
Wherever the bastard was. 

Rowan didn't object as she took another step, then another. She had to 
put distance between them all--had to make sure that every last ember was 
capable of reaching that army and that she didn't waste her strength by 
traveling far to do so. 


Which meant striding out into the marshes alone. To wait for those 
things to be close enough to see their teeth. They had to know who now 
marched through the reeds toward them. What she'd do to them. 

But still the ilken charged. 

In the distance, far to the right, marsh creatures began to roar--no doubt 
in Lysandra's wake. She prayed the beasts were hungry. And that they 
didn't mind Morath-bred meat. 

"Aelin." Rowan's voice cut across water and plant and wind. She 
paused, looking over a shoulder at where he now stood on the sandbank, as 
if it'd been impossible not to follow her. 

The strong, unyielding bones of his face were set with that warrior's 
brutality. But his pine-green eyes were bright--almost soft--as he said, 
"Remember who you are. Every step of the way down, and every step of 
the way back. Remember who you are. And that you're mine." 

She thought of the new, delicate scars on his back--marks from her own 
nails, that he'd refused to heal with his magic, and instead had set with 
seawater, the salt locking the scars into place before the immortal body 
could smooth it over. Her claiming marks, he'd breathed into her mouth the 
last time he'd been inside her. So he and anyone who saw them would know 
that he belonged to her. That he was hers, just as she was his. 

And because he was hers, because they were all hers ... 

Aelin turned away from him and sprinted across the plain. 

With every step toward the army whose wings she could just make out, 
she watched for those beasts Lysandra riled, even as she began a swift, 
deadly descent into the core of her magic. 

She had been hovering around the middle ledge of her power for days 
now, one eye on the churning, molten abyss far below. Rowan knew. Fenrys 
and Gavriel, definitely. Shielding them, drying their clothes, killing the 
insects that plagued them ... all little ways to relieve the strain, to keep 
herself steady, to grow accustomed to its depth and pressure. 

For the deeper she went into her power, the more her body, her mind, 
squeezed under the pressure of it. That was the burnout--when that 
pressure won, when the magic was drained too fast or too greedily, when it 
was spent and still the bearer tried to claw deeper than it should. 

Aelin slammed to a stop in the heart of the plain. The ilken had spied 
her sprinting and now flapped toward her. 


Unaware of the three males who crept far out, bows at the ready to push 
Erawan's soldiers onto her flames. 

If she could burn through their defenses. She'd have to drag up every bit 
of her power to incinerate them all. The true might of Aelin Fire-Bringer. 
Not an ember less. 

So Aelin abandoned every trapping of civilization, of conscience and 
rules and humanity, and plummeted into her fire. 

She flew for that flaming abyss, only distantly aware of the humidity 
lying thick on her skin, of the pressure building in her head. 

She'd shoot straight down--and push off the bottom, bringing all that 
power with her to the surface. The drag would be enormous. And it would 
be the test, the true test, of control and strength. Easy--so easy to spear into 
the heart of fire and ash. The hard part was bringing it up; that was when 
the cracking would occur. 

Deeper and deeper, Aelin shot into her power. Through distant, mortal 
eyes, she noted the ilken sweeping closer. A mercy--if they had once been 
human, perhaps obliterating them would be a mercy. 

Aelin knew she'd reached the former edge of her power thanks to 
warning bells in her blood that pealed in her wake. That pealed as she 
launched herself into the burning depths of hell. 

The Queen of Flame and Shadow, the Heir of Fire, Aelin of the 
Wildfire, Fireheart ... 

She burned through each title, even as she became them, became what 
those foreign ambassadors had hissed when they reported on a child- 
queen's growing, unstable power in Terrasen. A promise that had been 
whispered into the blackness. 

The pressure began to build in her head, in her veins. 

Far behind, safely out of her range, she felt the flickers of Rowan's and 
Dorian's magic as they rallied the blasts that would answer her own. 

Aelin soared into the uncharted core of her power. 

The inferno went on and on. 


Chapter 50


Lorcan knew they were still too slow, warning signal or not. 

Elide was gasping for breath, weaving on her feet as Lorcan halted on 
the outskirts of a massive, flooded plain. She pushed back a stray strand of 
hair from her face, Athril's ring glinting on her finger. She hadn't 
questioned where it had come from or what it did when he'd slipped it onto 
her finger this morning. He'd only warned her to never take it off, that it 
might be the one thing to keep her safe from the ilken, from Morath. 

The force had swept northward and away from where Lorcan and Elide 
had hauled ass, no doubt to secure some better approach. And at the far end 
of the plain, too distant for Elide's human eyes to clearly make out, 
Whitethorn's silver hair glinted, the King of Adarlan at his side. Magic, 
bright and cold, swirling around them. And farther out-- 

Gods above. Gavriel and Fenrys were in the reeds, bows drawn. And 
Gavriel's son. Aimed at the army approaching. Waiting for-- 

Lorcan tracked where they were all facing. 

Not the army closing in on them. 

But the queen standing alone in the heart of the flooded plain. 

Lorcan realized a moment too late that he and Elide were on the wrong 
side of the demarcation line--too far north of where Aelin's companions 
stood safely behind her. 

Realized it the exact heartbeat that Elide's eyes fell on the golden-haired 
woman facing that army. 

Her arms slackened at her sides. Her face drained of color. 

Elide staggered one step--one step toward Aelin, a small noise coming 
out of her. 

That's when he felt it. 

Lorcan had sensed it once before, that day at Mistward. When the 
Queen of Terrasen had laid waste to the Valg princes, when her power had 


been a behemoth surging from the deep, setting the world trembling. 

That was nothing--nothing--compared to the power that now roared 
into the world. 

Elide stumbled, gaping at the spongy earth as the marsh water rippled. 

Five hundred ilken closed in around them. They had taken his warning 
--and set a trap. 

And that power ... that power Aelin was now dragging up from 
whatever hellhole was inside her, from whatever fiery pit she'd been 
damned to endure ... Its wake would wash over them. 

"What is ... ," Elide breathed, but Lorcan lunged for her, hurling them 
to the ground, covering her body with his. He threw a shield over them, 
plummeting hard and fast into his magic, the drop nearly uncontrolled. He 
didn't have time to do anything but pour every ounce of power into his 
shield, into the one barrier that would keep them from being melted into 
nothing. 

He shouldn't have wasted the effort warning them. Not when it was 
now likely to get him and Elide killed. 

Whitethorn knew--even at Mistward--that the queen hadn't yet 
stepped into her birthright. Knew that this sort of power came around once 
in an eon, and to serve it, to serve her ... 

A court that wouldn't just change the world. It would start the world 
over. 

A court that could conquer this world--and any other it wished. 

If it wished. If that woman on the plain desired to. And that was the 
question, wasn't it? 

"Lorcan," Elide whispered, her voice breaking in longing for the queen, 
or terror of her, he didn't know. 

Didn't have time to guess, as a feral roar went up from the reeds. A 
command. 

And then a hail of arrows, precisely and brutally aimed, flew from the 
marshes to strike at the outer flanks of the ilken. He marked Fenrys's shots 
by the black-tipped arrows that easily found their marks. Gavriel's son 
didn't miss, either. [ken tumbled from the sky, and the others panicked, 
flapping into one another, careening inward. 

Right to where the Queen of Terrasen unleashed the full force of her 
magic upon them. 


The moment Lysandra roared to signal that the marsh beasts were riled and 
she was safely behind their lines again, the moment the ilken got so close 
Aedion could shoot them out of the sky like geese, his queen erupted. 

Even with Aelin's aim away from them, even with Rowan's shield, the 
heat of that fire burned. "Holy gods," Aedion found himself saying as he 
stumbled back through the reeds, falling farther behind her line of attack. 
"Holy rutting gods." 

The heart of the legion didn't have the chance to scream as they were 
washed away in a sea of flame. 

Aelin was no savior to rally behind, but a cataclysm to be weathered. 

The fire grew hotter, his bones groaning as sweat beaded on his brow. 
But Aedion took up a new spot, glancing to ensure his father and Fenrys 
had done the same across the drowned plain, and aimed for the ilken 
veering out of the flame's path. He made his arrows count. 

Ashes fell to the earth in a slow, steady snow. 

Not fast enough. As if sensing Aelin's dragging pace, ice and wind 
erupted overhead. 

Where gold-and-red flame did not melt Erawan's legion, Dorian and 
Rowan ripped them apart. 

The ilken still held out, as if they were a stain of darkness, harder to 
wash away. 

Still Aelin kept burning. Aedion couldn't even see her in the heart of 
that power. 

There was a cost--there had to be a cost to such power. 

She had been born knowing the weight of her crown, her magic. Had 
felt its isolation long before she'd reached adolescence. And that seemed 
like punishment enough, but ... there had to be a price. 

Nameless is my price. That was what the witch had said. 

Understanding glimmered at the edge of Aedion's mind, just out of 
grasp. He fired his second-to-last arrow, straight between the eyes of a 
frantic ilken. 

One by one, their own foul-bred resistance to magic yielded to those 
bursts of ice, and wind, and flame. 


And then Whitethorn began walking into the firestorm fifty feet ahead. 
Toward Aelin. 


Lorcan pinned Elide to the earth, throwing every last shadow and pocket of 
darkness into that shield. The flames were so hot that sweat dripped down 
his brow, right into her silken hair, spread on the green moss. The marsh 
water around them boiled. 

Boiled. Fish floated belly-up. The grasses dried out and caught fire. The 
entire world was a hell-realm, with no end and no beginning. 

Lorcan's shredded, dark soul tipped its head back and roared in unison 
to her power's burning song. 

Elide was cringing, fists balled in his shirt, face buried against his neck 
as he gritted his teeth and weathered the firestorm. Not just fire, he realized. 
But wind and ice. Two other, mighty magics had joined her--shredding the 
ilken. And his own shield. 

Wave after wave, the magic battered his power. A lesser gift might have 
been broken against it--a lesser magic might have tried to fight back, and 
not just let the power wash over them. 

If Erawan got a collar around Aelin Galathynius's neck ... it would be 
over. 

To leash that woman, that power ... Would a collar even be able to 
contain that? 

There was movement through the flames. 

Whitethorn was prowling across the boiling marshes, his steps 
unhurried. 

The flame swirled around the dome of Rowan's shield, eddying with his 
icy wind. 

Only a male who'd lost his damn mind would wander into that storm. 

The ilken died and died and died, slowly and not at all cleanly, as their 
dark magic failed them. Those that tried to flee the flame or ice or wind 
were felled by arrows. Those that managed to land were shredded apart by 
ambushes of claws and fangs and snapping, scaled tails. 

They'd made every minute of his warning count. Had easily set a trap 
for the ilken. That they'd fallen for it so swiftly-- 


But Rowan reached the queen in the heart of the marshes as her flames 
winked out. As his own wind died out, and plumes of unforgiving ice 
shattered the few ilken flapping in the skies. 

Ash and glittering ice rained down, thick and swirling as snow, embers 
dancing between the clumps that had once been the ilken. There were no 
survivors. Not one. 

Lorcan didn't dare lift his shield. 

Not as the prince stepped onto the small island where the queen was 
standing. Not as Aelin turned toward Rowan, and the only flame that 
remained was a crown of fire atop her head. 

Lorcan watched in silence as Rowan slid a hand over her waist, the 
other cupping the side of her face, and kissed his queen. 

Embers stirred her unbound hair as she wrapped her arms around his 
neck and pressed close. A golden crown of flame flickered to life atop 
Rowan's head--the twin to the one Lorcan had seen burning that day at 
Mistward. 

He knew Whitethorn. He knew the prince wasn't ambitious--not in the 
way that immortals could be. He likely would have loved the woman if 
she'd been ordinary. But this power ... 

In his wasteland of a soul, Lorcan felt that tug. Hated it. 

It was why Whitethorn had strode to her--why Fenrys was now 
halfway across the plain, dazed, attention wholly fixed on where they stood, 
tangled in each other. 

Elide stirred beneath him. "Is--is it over?" 

Given the heat with which the queen was kissing her prince, he wasn't 
entirely sure what to tell Elide. But he let her squirm out from beneath him, 
twisting to her feet to spy the two figures on the horizon. He rose, watching 
with her. 

"They killed them all," she breathed. 

An entire legion--gone. Not easily, but--they'd done it. 

Ash continued to fall, clumping on Elide's silky night-dark hair. He 
gently picked out a bit, then put a shield over her to keep it from landing on 
her again. 

He hadn't touched her since last night. There hadn't been time, and he 
hadn't wanted to think about what her kiss had done to him. How it had 


utterly wrecked him and still twisted up his guts in ways he wasn't sure he 
could live with. 

Elide said, ""What do we do now?" 

It took him a moment to realize what she'd meant. Aelin and Rowan at 
last pulled apart, though the prince leaned in to nuzzle her neck. 

Power called to power among the Fae. Perhaps Aelin Galathynius was 
unlucky the cadre had been drawn to Maeve's power long before she was 
born, had chained themselves to her instead. 

Perhaps they were the unlucky ones, for not holding out for something 
better. 

Lorcan shook his head to clear the useless, traitorous thoughts. 

That was Aelin Galathynius standing there. Drained of her power. 

He felt it now--the utter lack of sound or feeling or heat where there 
had been such a riotous storm moments before. A creeping cold. 

She'd emptied her entire cache. They all had. Maybe Whitethorn had 
gone to her, put his arms around her, not because he wanted to mount her in 
the middle of the marshes, but to keep her upright once that power was 
gone. Once she was left vulnerable. 

Open to attack. 

What do we do now? Elide had asked. 

Lorcan smiled slightly. "We go say hello." 

She balked at the shift in his tone. "You're not on friendly terms." 

Certainly not, and he wasn't about to be, not when the queen was within 
his sights. Not when she had that Wyrdkey ... the sibling to the one Elide 
carried. 

"They won't attack me," he said, and began heading for them. The 
marsh water was near-scalding, and he grimaced at the fish floating, milky 
eyes open wide to the sky. Frogs and other beasts bobbed among them, 
wobbling in his ripples. 

Elide hissed at entering the hot water but followed after him. 

Slowly, Lorcan closed in on his prey, too focused on the fire-breathing 
bitch to notice that Fenrys and Gavriel had vanished from their positions in 
the reeds. 


Chapter 51


Every step toward Aelin was an eternity--and every step was somehow too 
swift. 

Elide had never been more aware of her limp. Of her dirty clothes; of 
her long, unshaped hair; of her small body and lack of any discernible gifts. 

She had imagined Aelin's power, dreamed of how it had shattered the 
glass castle. 

She hadn't considered that the reality of seeing it unleashed would make 
her bones quail in terror. Or that the others would possess such harrowing 
gifts as well--ice and wind twining with fire, until only death rained down. 
She almost felt bad for the ilken they'd slaughtered. Almost. 

Lorcan was silent. Tense. 

She was able to read his moods now, the little tells that he believed no 
one could detect. But there--that faint twitch on the left side of his mouth. 
That was his attempt to suppress whatever rage was now riding him. And 
there, that slight angle of his head to the right ... that was his assessing and 
reassessing every surrounding, every weapon and obstacle within sight. 
Whatever this meeting was, Lorcan didn't think it would go well. 

He expected to fight. 

But Aelin--Ae/in--had now turned toward them from where she stood 
on that mound of grass. Her silver-haired prince pivoted with her. Took a 
casual step in front of her. Aelin sidestepped around him. He tried to block 
her again. She nudged him with an elbow and held her ground at his side. 
The Prince of Doranelle--her queen's lover. How much sway would his 
opinion hold over Aelin? If he hated Lorcan, would his contempt and 
mistrust for her as well be immediate? 

She should have thought of it--how it'd look to be with Lorcan. 
Approach with Lorcan. 


"Regretting your choice in allies?" Lorcan said with cutting calm. Like 
he'd been able to read her tells, too. 

"It sends a message, doesn't it?" 

She could have sworn something like hurt flashed in his eyes. But it was 
typical Lorcan--even when she'd ripped into him atop that barge, he'd 
barely flinched. 

He said coolly, "It would seem our bargain with each other is about to 
end anyway. Ill be sure to explain the terms, don't worry. I'd hate for them 
to think you were slumming it with me." 

"That's not what I meant." 

He snorted. "I don't care." 

Elide halted, wanting to call him a liar, half because she knew he was 
lying and half because her own chest tightened at the words. But she kept 
silent, letting him walk ahead, that distance between them yawning wider 
with his every storming step. 

But what would she even say to Aelin? Hello? How do you do? Please 
dont burn me? Sorry I'm so filthy and lamed? 

A gentle hand touched her shoulder. Pay attention. Look around. 

Elide glanced up from where she'd been wincing at her dirty clothes. 
Lorcan was perhaps twenty feet ahead, the others mere figures near the 
horizon. 

The invisible hand on her shoulder squeezed. Observe. See. 

See what? Ash and ice rained to the right, ruins rose up on the left, 
nothing but open marshes spreading ahead. But Elide halted, scanning the 
world around her. 

Something was wrong. Something made any creatures that had survived 
the maelstrom of magic go silent again. The burnt grasses rustled and 
sighed. 

Lorcan kept walking, his back stiff, though he hadn't reached for his 
weapons. 

See see see. 

See what? She turned in place but found nothing. She opened her mouth 
to call to Lorcan. 

Golden eyes flickered in the brush not thirty paces ahead. 

Enormous golden eyes, fixed on Lorcan as he strode mere feet away. A 
mountain lion, ready to pounce, to shred flesh and sever bone-- 


No-- 

The beast exploded from the burnt grasses. 

Elide screamed Lorcan's name. 

He whirled, but not to the lion. Toward her, that furious face shooting 
toward her-- 

But she was running, leg shrieking in pain, as Lorcan finally sensed the 
attack about to swoop down on him. 

The mountain lion reached him, those thick claws going low while its 
teeth went right for his throat. 

Lorcan drew his hunting knife, so fast it was only the glint of gray light 
on steel. 

Beast and Fae male went down, right into the muddy water. 

Elide hurtled for him, a wordless scream breaking from her. Not a 
normal mountain lion. Not even close. Not with the way it knew Lorcan's 
every move as they rolled through the water, as they dodged and swiped 
and lunged, blood spurting, magic clashing, shield against shield-- 

Then the wolf attacked. 

A massive white wolf, sprinting out of nowhere, wild with rage and all 
of it focused on Lorcan. 

Lorcan broke from the lion, blood streaming down his arm, his leg, 
panting. But the wolf had vanished into nothing. Where was it, where was it 

It appeared out of thin air, as if it had stepped through an invisible 
bridge, ten feet from Lorcan. 

Not an attack. An execution. 

Elide cleared a gap between two mounds of land, icy grass slicing into 
her palms, something crunching in her leg-- 

The wolf leaped for Lorcan's vulnerable back, eyes glazed with 
bloodlust, teeth shining. 

Elide surged up the little hill, time spinning out beneath her. 

No no no no no no. 

Vicious white fangs neared Lorcan's spine. 

Lorcan heard her then, heard the shuddering sob as she threw herself 
into him. 

His dark eyes flared in what looked like terror as she slammed into his 
unprotected back. 


As he noticed the death blow not coming from the lion at his front, but 
the wolf whose jaws closed around her arm instead of Lorcan's neck. 

She could have sworn the wolf's eyes flared in horror as it tried to pull 
back the physical blow, as a dark, hard shield slammed into her, stealing her 
breath with its unflinching solidity-- 

Blood and pain and bone and grass and bellowing fury. 

The world tilted as she and Lorcan went down, her body thrown over 
his, the wolf's jaws wrenching out of her arm. 

She curled over Lorcan, waiting for the wolf and mountain lion to end 
it, to take her neck in their jaws and crunch down. 

No attack came. Silence cleaved the world. 

Lorcan flipped her over, his breathing ragged, his face bloody and pale 
as he took in her face, her arm. "ElideElideElide--"' 

She couldn't draw breath, couldn't see around the sensation that her arm 
was mere shredded flesh and splintered bone-- 

Lorcan grabbed her face before she could look and snapped, "Why did 
you do that? Why?" He didn't wait for an answer. He lifted his head, his 
snarl so vicious it echoed in her bones, made the pain in her arm surge 
violently enough that she whimpered. 

He growled to the lion and the wolf, his shield a swirling, obsidian wind 
around them, "You're dead. You're both dead--" 

Elide shifted her head enough to see the white wolf staring at them. At 
Lorcan. See the wolf change in a flash of light into the most beautiful man 
she'd ever beheld. His golden-brown face tightened as he took in her arm. 
Her arm, her arm-- 

"Lorcan, we were ordered," said an unfamiliar, gentle male voice from 
where the lion, too, had transformed into a Fae male. 

"Damn your orders to hell, you stupid bastard--" 

The wolf-warrior hissed, chest heaving, "We can't fight against the 
command much longer, Lorcan--" 

"Put the shield down," the calmer one said. "I can heal the girl. Let her 
get away." 

"PI kill you both," Lorcan swore. "PIH kill you--" 

Elide looked at her arm. 

There was a piece missing. From her forearm. There was blood gushing 
into the burnt remnants of grass. White bone jutting out-- 


Maybe she started screaming or sobbing or silently shaking. 

"Dont look," Lorcan snapped, squeezing her face again to draw her 
eyes to his own. His face was lined with such wrath she barely recognized 
it, but he made no move against the males. 

His power was drained. He'd nearly wiped it out shielding against 
Aelin's flame and whoever had borne that other magic on the field. This 
shield ... this was all Lorcan had left. 

And if he lowered it so they could heal her ... they'd kill him. He had 
warned them of the attack, and they'd still kill him. 

Aelin--where was Aelin-- 

The world was blackening at the edges, her body begging to submit 
rather than endure the pain that reordered everything in her life. 

Lorcan tensed as if sensing the oblivion that threatened. "You heal her," 
he said to the gentle-eyed male, "and then we continue--" 

"No," she got out. Not for this, not for her-- 

Lorcan's onyx eyes were unreadable as he scanned her face. And then 
he said quietly, "I wanted to go to Perranth with you." 

Lorcan dropped the shield. 


It was not a hard choice. And it did not frighten him. Not nearly as much as 
the fatal wound in her arm did. 

Fenrys had hit an artery. She'd bleed out in minutes. 

Lorcan had been born from and gifted with darkness. Returning to it 
was not a difficult task. 

But letting that glimmering, lovely light before him die out ... In his 
ancient, bitter bones, he could not accept it. 

She had been forgotten--by everyone and everything. And still she had 
hoped. And still she had been kind to him. 

And still she had offered him a glimpse of peace in the time he'd known 
her. 

She had offered him a home. 

He knew Fenrys wouldn't be able to fight Maeve's kill order. Knew 
Gavriel would stay true to his word and heal her, but Fenrys couldn't hold 
out against the blood oath's command. 


He knew the bastard would regret it. Knew the wolf had been horrified 
the moment Elide had jumped between them. 

Lorcan let go of his shield, praying she wouldn't watch when the 
bloodletting started. When he and Fenrys went claw-to-claw and fang-to- 
fang. He'd last against the warrior. Until Gavriel joined back in. 

The shield vanished, and Gavriel was instantly kneeling, reaching with 
his broad hands for her arm. Pain paralyzed her, but she tried telling Lorcan 
to run, to put the shield back up-- 

Lorcan stood, shutting out her pleading. 

He faced Fenrys. The warrior was trembling with restraint, his hands 
clenched at his sides to keep from going for any of his blades. 

Elide was still sobbing, still begging him. 

Fenrys's taut features were lined with regret. 

Lorcan just smiled at the warrior. 

It snapped Fenrys's leash. 

His sentinel leaped for him, sword out, and Lorcan lifted his own, 
already knowing the move Fenrys planned to use. He'd trained him how to 
do it. And he knew the guard Fenrys let drop on his left side, just for a 
heartbeat, exposing his neck-- 

Fenrys landed before him, swiping low and dodging right. 

Lorcan angled his blade for that vulnerable neck. 

They were both blown back by an icy, unbreakable wind. Whatever was 
left of it after the battle. 

Fenrys was up, lost to the blood fury, but the wind slammed into him. 
Again. Again. Holding him down. Lorcan struggled against it, but the shield 
Whitethorn had thrown over them, the raw power he now used to keep them 
pinned, was too strong when his own magic was depleted. 

Boots crunched on the burnt grass. Sprawled on the bank of a little hill, 
Lorcan lifted his head. Whitethorn stood between him and Fenrys, the 
prince's eyes glazed with wrath. 

Rowan surveyed Gavriel and Elide, the latter still weeping, still begging 
for it to stop. But her arm ... 

A scratch marred that moon-white arm, but Gavriel's rough battlefield 
healing had filled the holes, the missing flesh and broken bones. He must 
have used all his magic to-- 

Gavriel swayed ever so slightly. 


Whitethorn's voice was like gravel. "This ends now. You two don't 
touch them. They're under the protection of Aelin Galathynius. If you harm 
them, it will be considered an act of war." 

Specific, ancient words, the only way a blood order could be detained. 
Not overridden--just delayed for a little while. To buy them all time. 

Fenrys panted, but relief flickered in his eyes. Gavriel sagged a bit. 

Elide's dark eyes were still glassy with pain, the smattering of freckles 
on her cheeks stark against the unnatural whiteness of her skin. 

Whitethorn said to Fenrys and Gavriel, "Are we clear on what the hell 
will happen if you step out of line?" 

To Lorcan's eternal shock, they lowered their heads and said, "Yes, 
Prince." 

Rowan let the shields drop, and then Lorcan was hurtling to Elide, who 
struggled to sit up, gaping at her nearly healed arm. Gavriel, wisely, backed 
away. Lorcan examined her arm, her face, needing to touch her, smell her-- 

He didn't notice that the light footsteps in the grass didn't belong to his 
former companions. 

But he knew the female voice that said from behind him, "What the 
rutting hell is going on?" 


Elide had no words to express to Lorcan what she'd felt in that moment 
he'd let the shield drop. What she'd felt when the silver-haired, tattooed 
watrior-prince had halted that fatal bloodshed. 

But she had no breath in her body when she looked over Lorcan's broad 
shoulder and beheld the golden-haired woman striding toward them. 

Young, and yet her face ... It was an ancient face, wary and cunning and 
limned with power. Beautiful, with the sun-kissed skin, the vibrant 
turquoise eyes. Turquoise eyes, with a core of gold around the pupil. 

Ashryver eyes. 

The same as the golden-haired, handsome man who came up beside her, 
muscled body tense as he assessed whether he'd need to spill blood, a bow 
dangling from his hand. 

Two sides of the same golden coin. 

Aelin. Aedion. 


They were both staring at her with those Ashryver eyes. 

Aelin blinked. And her golden face crumpled as she said, "Are you 
Elide?" 

It was all Elide could do to nod. Lorcan was taut as a bowstring, his 
body still half angled over her. 

Aelin strode closer, eyes never leaving Elide's face. Young--she felt so 
young compared to the woman who approached. There were scars all over 
Aelin's hands, along her neck, around her wrists ... where shackles had 
been. 

Aelin slid to her knees not a foot away, and it occurred to Elide that she 
should be bowing, head to the dirt-- 

"You look ... so much like your mother," Aelin said, her voice cracking. 
Aedion silently knelt, putting a broad hand on Aelin's shoulder. 

Her mother, who had gone down swinging, who had died fighting so 
this woman could live-- 

"I'm sorry," Aelin said, shoulders curving inward, head dropping low as 
tears slid down her flushed cheeks. "I'm so sorry." How many years had 
those words been locked up? 

Elide's arm ached, but it didn't stop her from touching Aelin's hand, 
clenched in her lap. 

Touching that tanned, scarred hand. Warm, sticky skin met her 
fingertips. 

Real. This was--Aelin was--real. 

As if Aelin realized the same, her head lifted. She opened her mouth, 
but her lips wobbled, and the queen clamped them together. 

None of the gathered company spoke. 

And at last Aelin said to Elide, "She bought me time." 

Elide knew who the queen meant. 

Aelin's hand began shaking. The queen's voice broke entirely as she 
said, "I am alive today because of your mother." 

Elide only whispered, "I know." 

"She told me to tell you ..." A shuddering inhale. But Aelin didn't 
break her stare, even as tears continued cutting through the dirt on her 
cheeks. "Your mother told me to tell you that she loves you--very much. 
Those were her last words to me. 'Tell my Elide I love her very much.'" 


For over ten years, Aelin had been the sole bearer of those final words. 
Ten years, through death and despair and war, Aelin had carried them 
across kingdoms. 

And here, at the edge of the world, they had found each other again. 
Here at the edge of the world, just for a heartbeat, Elide felt the warm hand 
of her mother brush her shoulder. 

Tears stung Elide's eyes as they slipped free. But then the grass 
crunched behind them. 

She saw the white hair first. Then the golden eyes. 

And Elide sobbed as Manon Blackbeak emerged, smiling faintly. 

As Manon Blackbeak saw her and Aelin, knee-to-knee in the grass, and 
mouthed one word. 

Hope. 

Not dead. None of them were dead. 

Aedion said hoarsely, "Is your arm--" 

Aelin grabbed it--gently. Inspecting the shallow cut, the new pink skin 
that revealed what had been missing mere moments before. Aelin twisted 
on her knees, snarling at the wolf-warrior. 

The golden-haired male averted his eyes as the queen glared her 
displeasure. "It wasn't his fault," Elide managed to say. 

"The bite," Aelin said drily, turquoise eyes livid, "would suggest 
otherwise." 

"I'm sorry," the male said, either to the queen or Elide, she didn't know. 
His eyes lifted to Aelin--something like devastation there. 

Aelin ignored the words. The male flinched. And the silver-haired 
prince seemed to give him a brief pitying glance. 

But if the order hadn't come from Aelin to kill Lorcan ... 

Aelin said to the other golden-haired male behind Elide, the one who 
had healed her--the lion, "I assume Rowan told you the deal. You touch 
them, you die. You so much as breathe wrong in their direction, and you're 
dead." 

Elide tried not to cringe at the viciousness. Especially when Manon 
smiled in wicked delight. 

Aelin tensed as the witch came at her exposed back but allowed Manon 
to settle on her right. To look over Elide with those gold eyes. "Well met, 
witchling," Manon said to her. Manon faced Lorcan just as Aelin did. 


Aelin snorted. "You look a bit worse for wear." 

"Likewise," Lorcan snapped at her. 

Aelin's grin was terrifying. "Got my note, did you?" 

Aedion's hand had slid to his sword-- 

"The Sword of Orynth," Elide blurted, noticing the bone pommel, the 
ancient markings. Aelin and Lorcan paused being at each other's throats. 
"The sword ... you..." 

Vernon had mocked her about it once. Said it had been taken by the 
King of Adarlan and melted down. Burned, along with the antler throne. 

Aedion's turquoise eyes softened. "It survived. We survived." 

The three of them, the remnants of their court, their families. 

But Aelin was again sizing up Lorcan, bristling, that wicked grin 
returning. Elide said softly, "I survived, Majesty, because of him." She 
pointed with her chin to Manon. "And because of her. I am here because of 
both of them." 

Manon nodded, focus going to the pocket where she'd seen Elide hide 
that scrap of stone. The confirmation she'd been looking for. The reminder 
of the third part of the triangle. 

"Pm here," Elide said as Aelin fixed those unnervingly vivid eyes on 
her, "because of Kaltain Rompier." Her throat clogged, but she pushed past 
it as her trembling fingers fished out the little bit of cloth from her inside 
pocket. The otherworldly feel of it pulsed in her palm. 

"She said to give this to you. To Celaena Sardothien, I mean. She didn't 
know they ... you were the same. She said it was payment for ... for a 
warm cloak offered in a cold dungeon." She wasn't ashamed of the tears 
that fell, not in honor of what that woman had done. Aelin studied the scrap 
of cloth in Elide's shaking palm. "I think she kept this as a reminder of 
kindness," Elide said hoarsely. "They ... they broke her, and hurt her. And 
she died alone in Morath. She died alone, so I wouldn't ... so they couldn't 
... None of them spoke or moved. She couldn't tell if it made it worse. If 
the hand that Lorcan laid on her back made her cry harder. 

The words tumbled out of Elide's shaking mouth. "She said t-to 
remember your promise to punish them all. And s-said that you can unlock 
any door, if you only have the k-key." 

Aelin clamped her lips together and closed her eyes. 


A beautiful, dark-haired man now approached. He was perhaps a few 
years older than her, but carried himself so gracefully that she felt small and 
unmolded before him. His sapphire eyes fixed on Elide, clever and 
unruffled--and sad. "Kaltain Rompier saved your life? And gave you that?" 

He knew her--had known her. 

Manon Blackbeak said in a faint, amused voice, "Lady Elide Lochan of 
Perranth, meet Dorian Havilliard, King of Adarlan." The king lifted his 
brows at the witch. 

"M-majesty," she stammered, inclining her head. She should really get 
up. Really stop lying on the ground like a worm. But the cloth and stone 
still lay in her hand. 

Aelin wiped her damp face on a sleeve, then straightened. "Do you 
know what it is you carry, Elide?" 

"Y-yes, Majesty." 

Turquoise eyes, haunted and weary, lifted to her own. Then slid to 
Lorcan. "Why didn't you take it?" The voice was hollow and hard. Elide 
suspected she'd be lucky if it was never used on her. 

Lorcan met her gaze without flinching. "It wasn't mine to take." 

Aelin now glanced between them, seeing too much. And there was no 
warmth on the queen's face, but she said to Lorcan, "Thank you--for 
bringing her to me." 

The others seemed to be trying not to look too shocked at the words. 

But Aelin turned to Manon. "I lay claim to her. Witch-blood in her veins 
or no, she is Lady of Perranth, and she is mine." 

Gold eyes gleamed with the thrill of challenge. "And if I claim her for 
the Blackbeaks?" 

"Blackbeaks--or the Crochans?" Aelin purred. 

Elide blinked. Manon--and the Crochans? What was the Wing Leader 
doing here? Where was Abraxos? The witch said, "Careful, Majesty. With 
your power reduced to embers, you'll have to fight me the old-fashioned 
way again." 

That dangerous grin returned. "You know, I've been hoping for round 
two." 

"Ladies," the silver-haired prince said through clenched teeth. 

They both turned, giving Rowan Whitethorn horrifyingly innocent 
smiles. The Fae Prince, to his credit, only winced after they looked away 


again. 

Elide wished she could hide behind Lorcan as both women fixed that 
near-feral attention on her again. Manon reached forward, tipping Elide's 
hand over--to where Aelin's waited. "There you go, over and done with," 
Manon said. 

Aelin cringed slightly but pocketed the cloth and the key inside. A 
shadow instantly lifted from Elide's heart, a whispering presence now 
silenced. 

Manon ordered, "On your feet. We were in the middle of something." 

She reached to pull Elide up, but Lorcan stepped in and did it himself. 
He didn't let go of Elide's arm, and she tried not to lean into his warmth. 
Tried not to make it seem like she hadn't just met her queen, her friend, her 
court, and ... somehow now found Lorcan to be the safest of them all. 

Manon smirked at Lorcan. "Your claim on her, male, is at the very 
bottom of the list." Iron teeth slid out, turning that beautiful face petrifying. 
Lorcan didn't let go. Manon crooned in that way that usually meant death, 
"Don't. Touch. Her." 

"You don't give me orders, witch," Lorcan said. "And you have no say 
in what is between us." 

Elide frowned at him. "You're making it worse." 

"We like to call it 'territorial male nonsense," Aelin confided. "Or 
'territorial Fae bastard' works just as nicely." 

The Fae Prince coughed pointedly behind her. 

The queen looked over a shoulder, brows raised. "Am I forgetting 
another term of endearment?" 

The warrior-prince's eyes glowed, even as his face remained set with 
predatory intent. "I think you covered it." 

Aelin winked at Lorcan. "You hurt her, and Ill melt your bones," she 
merely said, and walked away. 

Manon's iron-clad smile grew, and she gave Lorcan a mocking incline 
of the head as she followed in the queen's wake. 

Aedion looked Lorcan over and snorted. "Aelin does whatever she 
wants, but I think she'd let me see how many of your bones I can break 
before she melts them." Then he, too, was walking toward the two females. 
One silver, one gold. 


Elide almost screamed as a ghost leopard appeared out of nowhere, 
twitched its whiskers in Lorcan's direction, and then trotted after the 
women, its puffy tail swishing behind it. 

Then the king left, then the Fae males. Until only Prince Rowan 
Whitethorn stood there. He gave Elide a Look. 

Elide immediately shrugged out of Lorcan's grip. Aelin and Aedion had 
stopped ahead, waiting for her. Smiling faintly--welcomingly. 

So Elide headed for them, her court, and did not look back. 


Rowan had kept quiet during the past few minutes, observing. 

Lorcan had been willing to die for Elide. Had been willing to put aside 
his quest for Maeve in order for Elide to live. And had then acted territorial 
enough to make Rowan wonder if he seemed so ridiculous around Aelin all 
the time. 

Now alone, Rowan said to Lorcan, "How did you find us?" 

A cutting smile. "The dark god nudged me toward here. The ilken army 
did the rest." 

The same Lorcan he'd known for centuries, and yet ... not. Some hard 
edge had been dulled--no, soothed. 

Lorcan stared toward the source of that soothing, but his jaw clenched 
as his focus shifted to where Aelin walked beside her. "That power could 
just as easily destroy her, you know." 

"I know," Rowan admitted. What she'd done minutes ago, the power 
she'd summoned and unleashed ... It had been a song that had made his 
magic erupt in kind. 

When the ilken's resistance had finally yielded beneath flame and ice 
and wind, Rowan hadn't been able to stifle the yearning to walk into the 
burning heart of that power and see her glowing with it. 

Halfway across the plain, he'd realized it wasn't just the allure of it that 
tugged at him. It was the woman inside it, who might need physical contact 
with another living being to remind herself that she had a body, and people 
who loved her, and to pull back from that killing calm that so mercilessly 
wiped the ilken from the skies. But then the flames had vanished, their 


enemies raining down as ash and ice and corpses, and she'd looked at him 
... Holy gods, when she'd looked at him, he'd almost fallen to his knees. 

Queen, and lover, and friend--and more. He hadn't cared that they had 
an audience. He had needed to touch her, to reassure himself that she was 
all right, to feel the woman who could do such great and terrible things and 
still look at him with that beckoning, vibrant life in her eyes. 

You make me want to live, Rowan. 

He wondered if Elide Lochan had somehow made Lorcan want to do 
the same. 

He said to Lorcan, "And what about your mission?" 

Any softness vanished from Lorcan's granite-hewn features. "Why 
don't you tell me why you're in this shithole place, and then we'll discuss 
my plans." 

"Aelin can decide what to tell you." 

"Such a good dog." 

Rowan gave him a lazy smile but refrained from commenting on the 
delicate, dark-haired young woman who now held Lorcan's own leash. 


Chapter 52


Kaltain Rompier had just turned the tide in this war. 

Dorian had never been more ashamed of himself. 

He should have been better. Should have seen better. They all should 
have. 

The thoughts swirled and eddied as Dorian kept back in the half- 
drowned temple complex, silently watching as Aelin studied the chest on 
the altar as if it were an opponent. 

The queen was now flanked by Lady Elide, Manon on the dark-haired 
girl's other side, Lysandra sprawled in ghost leopard form at the queen's 
feet. 

The power in that cluster alone was staggering. And Elide ... Manon 
had murmured something to Aelin on their walk back into the ruins about 
Elide being watched over by Anneith. 

Watched over, as the rest of them seemed to be by other gods. 

Lorcan stepped into the ruins, Rowan at his side. Fenrys, Gavriel, and 
Aedion approached them, hands on their swords, bodies still thrumming 
with tension as they kept Lorcan within sight. Especially Maeve's warriors. 

Another ring of power. 

Lorcan--Lorcan, blessed by Hellas himself, Rowan had told him on 
that skiff ride into the Dead Islands. Hellas, god of death. Who had traveled 
here with Anneith, his consort. 

The hair on Dorian's arms rose. 

Scions--each of them touched by a different god, each of them subtly, 
quietly, guided here. It wasn't a coincidence. It couldn't be. 

Manon noticed him standing a few feet away, read whatever wariness 
was on his face, and broke from the circle of quietly talking women to come 
to his side. "What?" 

Dorian clenched his jaw. "I have a bad feeling about this." 


He waited for the dismissal, the mockery. Manon only said, "Explain." 

He opened his mouth, but Aelin stepped up to the dais. 

The Lock--the Lock that would contain the Wyrdkeys, would allow 
Aelin to put them back in their gate. Thanks to Kaltain, thanks to Elide, 
they only needed one more. Wherever Erawan had it. But getting this Lock 


Rowan was instantly at the queen's side as she peered into the chest. 

Slowly, she looked back at them. At Manon. 

"Get up here," the queen said in an unnervingly calm voice. 

Manon, wisely, did not refuse. 

"This isn't the place or time for exploring it," Rowan said to the queen. 
"We move it back to the ship, then figure it out from there." 

Aelin murmured her agreement, her face paling. 

Manon asked them, "Was the Lock ever here to begin with?" 

"I don't know." Dorian had never heard Aelin utter the words. It was 
enough to send him splashing up the stairs, dripping water behind him as he 
peered in. 

There was no Lock. Not in the way that they had expected, not in the 
way the queen had been promised and instructed to find it. 

The stone chest held only one thing: 

An iron-bound mirror, the surface near-golden with age, speckled, and 
covered in grime. And along the twining, intricately carved border, tucked 
into the upper right corner ... 

The marking of the Eye of Elena. A witch symbol. 

"What the hell is it?" Aedion demanded from the steps below. 

It was Manon who answered, glancing sidelong at the grim-faced 
queen, "It's a witch mirror." 

"A what?" Aelin asked. The others edged closer. 

Manon tapped a nail on the stone rim of the chest. "When you killed 
Yellowlegs, did she give any hint about why she was there, what she wanted 
from you or the former king?" Dorian searched his own memory but found 
nothing. 

"No." Aelin glanced to him in question, but Dorian shook his head as 
well. She asked the witch, "Do you know why she was there?" 

A hint of a nod. A breath of hesitation. Dorian braced himself. 
"Yellowlegs was there to meet with the king--to show him how her magic 


mirrors worked." 

"I smashed most of them," Aelin said, crossing her arms. 

"Whatever you destroyd were cheap tricks and replicas. Her true witch 
mirrors ... You cannot break those. Not easily, at least." 

Dorian had a horrible feeling about where this was headed. "What can 
they do?" 

"You can see the future, past, present. You can speak between mirrors, if 
someone possesses the sister-glass. And then there are the rare silvers-- 
whose forging demands something vital from the maker." Manon's voice 
dropped low. Dorian wondered if even among the Blackbeaks, these tales 
had only been whispered at their campfires. "Other mirrors amplify and 
hold blasts of raw power, to be unleashed if the mirror is aimed at 
something." 

"A weapon," Aedion said, eliciting a nod from Manon. The general 
must have been piecing things together as well because he asked before 
Dorian could, "Yellowlegs met with him about those weapons, didn't she?" 

Manon went silent for long enough that he knew Aelin was about to 
push. But Dorian gave her a warning stare to keep quiet. So she did. They 
all did. 

Finally, the witch said, "They've been making towers. Enormous, yet 
capable of being hauled across battlefields, lined with those mirrors. For 
Erawan to use with his powers--to incinerate your armies in a few blasts." 

Aelin closed her eyes. Rowan laid a hand on her shoulder. 

Dorian asked, "Is this ..." He gestured to the chest, the mirror inside. 
"One of the mirrors they plan to use?" 

"No," Manon said, studying the witch mirror within the chest. 
"Whatever this mirror is ... I'm not sure what it was meant for. What it can 
even do. But it surely isn't that Lock you sought." 

Aelin fished the Eye of Elena from her pocket, weighing it in her hand, 
and loosed a sharp sigh through her nose. "I'm ready for today to be over." 


Mile after mile, the Fae males carried the mirror between them. 
Rowan and Aedion pushed Manon for details on those witch towers. 
Two were already constructed, but she didn't know how many more were 


being built. They were stationed in the Ferian Gap, but with others possibly 
elsewhere. No, she didn't know the mode of transportation. Or how many 
witches to a tower. 

Aelin let their words settle into some deep, quiet part of her. She'd 
figure it out tomorrow--after she slept. Figure out this damn witch mirror 
tomorrow, too. 

Her magic was exhausted. For the first time in days, that pit of magic 
now slumbered. 

She could sleep for a week. A month. 

Each step across the marshes, back toward where those three ships 
would be waiting, was an effort. Lysandra frequently offered to shift into a 
horse and carry her, but Aelin refused. The shifter was drained as well. 
They all were. 

She wanted to talk to Elide, wanted to ask about so many things 
regarding those years apart, but ... The exhaustion that nagged at her 
rendered speech nearly impossible. She knew what kind of sleep beckoned 
--the deep, restorative slumber that her body demanded after too much 
magic had been spent, after she'd held on to it for too long. 

So Aelin hardly spoke to Elide, leaving the lady to lean on Lorcan as 
they hurried to the coast. As they hauled the mirror with them. 

Too many secrets--there were still too many secrets with Elena and 
Brannon and their long-ago war. Had the Lock ever existed? Or was the 
witch mirror the Lock? Too many questions with too few answers. She'd 
figure it out. Once they were back to safety. Once she had a chance to sleep. 

Once ... everything else fell into place, too. So they trudged through the 
marshes without rest. 

It was Lysandra who picked up on it with that leopard's senses, half a 
mile from the white-sand beach and the calm gray sea beyond, a wall of 
grassy sand dunes blocking the view ahead. 

They all had weapons drawn as they scrambled up the dune, sand 
slipping from beneath them. Rowan didn't shift--the only proof he'd 
shown of his utter exhaustion. He made it up the hill first. Drew his sword 
from across his back. 

Aelin's breath burned her throat as she halted beside him, Gavriel and 
Fenrys gently setting down the mirror on her other side. 


Because a hundred gray sails stretched ahead, surrounding their own 
ships. 

They spread toward the western horizon, utterly silent save for the men 
they could barely make out on board. Ships from the west ... from the Gulf 
of Oro. 

Melisande's fleet. 

And on the beach, waiting for them ... a party of twenty warriors, led 
by a gray-cloaked woman. Lysandra's claws slipped free of their sheaths as 
she let out a low snarl. 

Lorcan shoved Elide behind him. "We retreat into the marshes," he said 
to Rowan, whose face was set in stone as he sized up the party on the 
beach, the looming fleet. "We can outrun them." 

Aelin slid her hands into her pockets. "They're not going to attack." 

Lorcan sneered, "You're guessing this based on your many years of 
experience in war?" 

"Watch it," Rowan snarled. 

"This is absurd," Lorcan spat, twisting away, as if he'd grab Elide, pale- 
faced at his side. "Our reservoirs are drained--" 

Lorcan was halted from hauling Elide over a shoulder by a paper-thin 
wall of fire. About as much as Aelin could summon. 

And by Manon and her iron nails stepping before him as she growled, 
"You're not taking Elide anywhere. Not now, and not ever." 

Lorcan rose to his full height. And before they could wreck everything 
with their brawling, Elide laid a delicate hand on Lorcan's arm--his own 
hand wrapped around the hilt of his sword. "I choose this, Manon." 

Manon only glanced at the hand on Lorcan's arm. "We'll discuss this 
later." 

Indeed. Aelin looked Lorcan over and jerked her chin. "Go brood 
somewhere else." The cloaked woman on the beach, along with her 
soldiers, was now striding toward them. 

Lorcan growled, "It's not over, this business between us." 

Aelin smiled a bit. "You think I don't know that?" 

But Lorcan prowled to Rowan, his dark power flickering, rippling away 
across the waves as if in a silent boom of thunder. Taking up a defensive 
position. 





Aelin looked to her stone-faced prince, then to Aedion, her cousin's 
sword and shield angled and at the ready, then the others. "Let's go say 
hello." 

Rowan started. "Aelin--" 

But she was already striding down the dune, doing her best to keep from 
sliding on the treacherous sand, to keep her head high. The others trailing 
behind were taut as bowstrings, but their breathing remained even--primed 
for anything. 

The soldiers were in heavy, worn gray armor, their faces rough and 
scarred, sizing them up as they hit the sand. Fenrys snarled at one of them, 
and the man averted his eyes. 

But the cloaked woman removed her hood as she approached with 
feline grace, halting perhaps ten feet away. 

Aelin knew every detail about her. 

Knew that she was twenty years old now. Knew that the medium-length, 
wine-red hair was her real hair color. Knew the red-brown eyes were the 
only she'd seen in any land, on any adventure. Knew the wolf's head on the 
pommel of the mighty sword at her side was her family's crest. She knew 
the smattering of freckles, the full, laughing mouth, knew the deceptively 
slim arms that hid rock-hard muscle as she crossed them. 

That full mouth slanted into a half grin as Ansel of Briarcliff, Queen of 
the Wastes, drawled, "Who gave you permission to use my name in pit 
fights, Aelin?" 

"I gave myself permission to use your name however I please, Ansel, 
the day I spared your life instead of ending you like the coward you are." 

That cocky smile widened. "Hello, bitch," Ansel purred. 

"Hello, traitor,' Aelin purred right back, surveying the armada spread 
before them. "Looks like you made it on time after all." 


Chapter 53


Aelin felt the utter shock of her companions ripple from them as Ansel 
bowed dramatically, gesturing to the ships behind them, and said, "As 
requested: your fleet." 

Aelin snorted. "Your soldiers look like they've seen better days." 

"Oh, they always look like that. I've tried and tried to get them to focus 
on outside appearances as much as improving their inner beauty, but ... you 
know how men are." 

Aelin chuckled. Even as she sensed her companions' shock turning into 
something red-hot. 

Manon stepped forward, the sea breeze whipping strands of her white 
hair over her face, and said to Aelin, "Melisande's fleet bows to Morath. 
You might as well be signing an alliance with Erawan, too, if you're 
working with this ... person." 

Ansel's face drained of color at the iron teeth, the nails. And Aelin 
remembered the story the assassin-turned-queen had once told her, 
whispered atop rolling desert sands and beneath a carpet of stars. A 
childhood friend--eaten alive by an Ironteeth witch. 

Then Ansel herself, after the slaughter of her family, had been spared 
when she'd stumbled into an Ironteeth witch's camp. 

Aelin said to Manon, "She is not from Melisande. The Wastes are allied 
with Terrasen." 

Aedion started, now sizing up the ships, the woman before them. 

Manon Blackbeak said in a voice like death, "Who is she to speak for 
the Wastes?" 

Oh, gods above. Aelin schooled her face into bland irreverence and 
gestured between the two women. "Manon Blackbeak, Heir to the 
Blackbeak Witch-Clan and now the last Crochan Queen ... meet Ansel of 
Briarcliff, assassin and Queen of the Western Wastes." 


Roaring filled Manon's head as they rowed back to their ship, interrupted 
only by the splashing of the oars through the calm waves. 

She was going to kill the red-haired bitch. Slowly. 

They remained silent until they reached the towering ship, then climbed 
its side. 

No sign of Abraxos. 

Manon scanned the skies, the fleet, the seas. Not a scale to be found. 

The rage in her gut twisted into something else, something worse, and 
she took a step for the ruddy-faced captain to demand answers. 

But Aelin casually stepped in her path, giving her an adder's smile as 
she glanced between Manon and the red-haired young woman who now 
leaned against the stair post. "You two should have a little chat later." 

Manon stormed around her. "Ansel of Briarcliff does not speak for the 
Wastes." 

Where was Abraxos-- 

"But you do?" 

And Manon had to wonder if she'd somehow ... somehow become 
tangled in whatever plans the queen had woven. Especially as Manon found 
herself forced to halt again, forced to turn back to the smirking queen and 
say, "Yes. I do." 


Even Rowan blinked at Manon Blackbeak's tone--the voice that was not 
witch or warrior or predator. Queen. 

The last Crochan Queen. 

Rowan sized up the potentially explosive fight brewing between Ansel 
of Briarcliff and Manon Blackbeak. 

He remembered all that Aelin had told him of Ansel--the betrayal while 
the two woman had trained in the desert, the fight to the death that had left 
Aelin sparing the red-haired woman. A life debt. 

Aelin had called in the life debt owed to her. 

Ansel, with a swaggering arrogance that completely explained why she 
and Aelin had become fast friends, drawled to Manon from where she'd 


perched on the quarterdeck stairs, "Well, last I heard, neither Crochan nor 
Ironteeth witches bothered to look after the Wastes. I suppose that as 
someone who has fed and guarded its people these past two years, I do get 
to speak for them. And decide who we help and how we do it." Ansel 
smirked at Aelin like the witch wasn't staring at her throat as if she'd rip it 
out with her iron teeth. "You and I live next door to each other, after all. It'd 
be un-neighborly of me not to help." 

"Explain," Aedion said tightly, his heartbeat thundering loud enough for 
Rowan to hear. The first word the general had uttered since Ansel had 
pulled back her hood. Since Aelin's little surprise had been waiting for them 
on the beach. 

Ansel angled her head, the silky red hair catching the light, looking, 
Rowan realized, like the richest red wine. Exactly as Aelin had once 
described it. "Well, months ago, I was minding my own business in the 
Wastes, when I got a message out of the blue. From Aelin. She sent me a 
message loud and clear from Rifthold. Pit fighting." She chuckled, shaking 
her head. "And I knew to get ready. To move my army to the edge of the 
Anascaul Mountains." 

Aedion's breathing snagged. Only centuries of training kept Rowan's 
from doing the same. His cadre remained stalwart behind them all, positions 
they'd taken hundreds of times over the centuries. Ready for bloodshed--or 
to fight their way out of it. 

Ansel smiled, a winning grin. "Half of them are on their way there now. 
Ready to join with Terrasen. The country of my friend Celaena Sardothien, 
who did not forget it, even when she was in the Red Desert; and who did 
not stop looking north every night that we could see the stars. There was no 
greater gift I could offer to repay her than saving the kingdom she did not 
forget. And that was before I got her letter months ago, telling me who she 
was and that she'd gut me if I didn't assist in her cause. I was on my way 
with my army already, but ... then the next letter arrived. Telling me to go 
to the Gulf of Oro. To meet her here and follow a specific set of 
instructions." 

Aedion snapped his head to Aelin, salt water still gleaming on his tan 
face from the boat over. "The dispatches from Ilium--" 

Aelin waved a lazy hand to Ansel. "Let the woman finish." 


Ansel strolled to Aelin and linked her arm through her elbow. She 
smirked like a fiend. "I'm assuming you lot know how bossy Her Majesty 
is. But I followed the instructions. I brought the other half of my army when 
I veered down south, and we hiked through the White Fangs and into 
Melisande. Its queen assumed we arrived to offer aid. She let us right in the 
front gates." 

Rowan held his breath. 

Ansel let out a sharp whistle, and on the nearest ship, clopping and 
nickering sounded. 

And then an Asterion horse emerged from the stables. 

The horse was a storm made flesh. 

Rowan couldn't remember the last time he'd seen Aelin beam with pure 
delight as she breathed, "Kasida." 

"Do you know," Ansel went on, "that I rather enjoy pillaging? With 
Melisande's troops spread so thin for Morath, she really had no choice but 
to yield. Though she was particularly furious to see me claim the horse 
made worse when I took her out of her dungeon to reveal that Terrasen's 
flag now flies alongside my wolf at her own damn house." 

"What," Aedion blurted. 

Aelin and Ansel faced them, brows high. Dorian staggered forward a 
step at Ansel's words, and the Queen of the Wastes gave him a look that 
said she'd like to pillage him. 

Ansel gestured to the ships around them with a broad sweep of her arm. 
"Melisande's fleet is now our fleet. And its capital is now ours, too." She 
jerked her chin at Aelin. "You're welcome." 

Manon Blackbeak burst out laughing. 





Aedion didn't know who to be more furious with: Aelin, for not telling him 
about Ansel of Briarcliff and the gods-damned army she'd quietly ordered 
to sack Melisande and seize its fleet, or himself, for not trusting her. For 
demanding where their allies were, for implying all that he had in those 
moments before the ilken attack. She'd just taken it. 

As Ansel's words sank in to the company still gathered on the main 
deck, his cousin said quietly, "Melisande meant to assist Morath in cleaving 


the North and South. I did not take its city for glory or conquest, but I will 
not allow anything to come between me and defeating Morath. Melisande 
will now clearly understand the cost of allying with Erawan." 

He tried not to bristle. He was her general-prince. Rowan was her 
consort--or close enough to it. And yet she had not entrusted them with 
this. He hadn't even contemplated the Wastes as an ally. Perhaps that was 
why. He would have told her not to bother. 

Aedion said to Ansel, "Melisande has likely already sent word to 
Morath. Its own armies are no doubt rushing back to the capital city. Get 
your remaining men across the Fangs again. We can lead the armada from 
here." 

Ansel looked to Aelin, who nodded her agreement. The Queen of the 
Wastes then asked him, "And then march north to Terrasen and cross at the 
Anascaul passes?" 

Aedion gave a single nod of confirmation, already calculating where 
he'd place her men, who in the Bane he'd give command over them. 
Without seeing Ansel's men fight ... Aedion began heading toward the 
stairs to the quarterdeck, not bothering to wait for permission. 

But Aelin halted him with a cleared throat. "Talk to Ansel before she 
leaves tomorrow morning about where to bring her army once it's whole 
again." 

He merely nodded and continued up the steps, ignoring his father's 
concerned look as he went. The others eventually split up, and Aedion 
didn't care where they went, only that he had a few minutes to himself. 

He leaned against the rail, peering into the sea lapping against the side 
of the ship, trying not to notice the men on the surrounding ships sizing up 
him and his companions. 

Some of their whispers hit him from across the water. The Wolf of the 
North; General Ashryver. Some began to tell stories--most outright lies, a 
few close enough to the truth. Aedion let the sound of them bleed into the 
plunk and hiss of the waves. 

Her ever-changing scent hit him, and something in his chest loosened. 
Loosened a bit further at the sight of her slim golden arms as she braced 
them on the rail beside his own. 

Lysandra glanced over her shoulder to where the witch and Elide--gods 
above, Elide--had gone to sit by the foremast, talking quietly. Probably 


recounting their own adventures since parting ways. 

The armada wouldn't sail until morning, he'd overheard the captain 
saying. He doubted it had to do with Aelin waiting to see if the Wing 
Leader's missing mount would return. 

"We shouldn't linger," Aedion said, now scanning the northern horizon. 
The ilken had come from that direction--and if they had found them so 
easily, even with an armada now around them ... "We're carrying two keys 
and the Lock--or whatever the hell that witch mirror actually is. The tide's 
with us. We should go." 

Lysandra shot him a sharp look. "Go take it up with Aelin." 

Aedion studied her from head to toe. "What's chewing on you?" 

She'd been distant for the past few days. But now he could practically 
see that courtesan's mask snap into place as she seemed to will her eyes to 
brighten, her frowning mouth to soften. "Nothing. I'm just tired." 
Something about the way she glanced toward the sea rubbed at him. 

Aedion said carefully, "We've been battling our way across the 
continent. Even after ten years of this, it still drains me. Not just physically, 
but--in my heart." 

Lysandra ran a finger down the smooth wood of the railing. "I thought 
... It all seemed a grand adventure. Even when the danger was so horrible, 
it was still new, and I was no longer caged in dresses and bedrooms. But 
that day in Skull's Bay, it stopped being any of that. It started being ... 
survival. And some of us might not make it." Her mouth wobbled a bit. "I 
never had friends--not as I do now. And today on that beach, when I saw 
that fleet and thought it belonged to our enemy ... For a moment, I wished 
Pd never met any of you. Because the thought of any of you ..." She 
sucked in a breath. "How do you do it? How have you learned to enter a 
battlefield with your Bane and not fall apart with the terror that not all of 
you might walk off it?" 

Aedion listened to every word, assessed every shaking breath. And he 
said plainly, "You have no choice but to learn to face it." He wished she 
didn't need to think of such things, have such weight on her. "The fear of 
loss ... it can destroy you as much as the loss itself." 

Lysandra at last met his gaze. Those green eyes--the sadness in them 
hit him like a blow to the gut. It was an effort not to reach for her. But she 


said, "I think we will both need to remind ourselves of that in the times 
ahead." 

He nodded, sighing through his nose. "And remember to enjoy what 
time we do have." She'd likely learned that as many times as he had. 

Her slender, lovely throat bobbed, and she glanced sidelong at him 
beneath lowered lashes. "I do enjoy it, you know. This--whatever this is." 

His heart ratcheted to a thunderous beat. Aedion debated whether or not 
to go for subtlety and gave himself the span of three breaths to decide. In 
the end, he went for his usual method, which had served him well both on 
and off battlefields: a precise sort of blunt attack, edged with enough 
outright arrogance to throw his opponents off their guard. "Whatever this 
is," he said with a half smile, "between us?" 

Lysandra indeed went on the defensive and showed her hand. "I know 
my history is ... unappealing." 

"I'm going to stop you right there," Aedion said, daring a step closer. 
"And I'm going to tell you that there is nothing unappealing about you. 
Nothing. lve been with just as many people. Women, men ... I've seen and 
tried it all." 

Her brows had risen. Aedion shrugged. "I find pleasure in both, 
depending on my mood and the person." One of his former lovers still 
remained one of his closest friends--and most skilled commanders in his 
Bane. "Attraction is attraction." He steeled his nerve. "And I know enough 
about it to understand what you and I ..." Something shuttered in her eyes, 
and the words slipped from him. Too soon. Too soon for this sort of talk. 
"We can figure it out. Make no demands of each other beyond honesty." 
That was really the only thing he cared to request. It was nothing more than 
he'd ask of a friend. 

A small smile played about her lips. "Yes," she breathed. "Let's start 
there." 

He dared another step closer, not caring who watched on the deck or in 
the rigging or in the armada around them. Color bloomed high on those 
beautiful cheekbones, and it was an effort not to stroke a finger across them, 
then his mouth. To taste her skin. 

But he'd take his time. Enjoy every moment, as he had told her to do. 

Because this would be his last hunt. He had no intention of wasting each 
glorious moment in one go. Of wasting any of the moments that fate had 


granted him, and all he wanted to show her. 

Every stream and forest and sea in Terrasen. To see Lysandra laugh her 
way through the autumnal circle dances; to weave ribbons around the 
maypoles in the spring; and listen, wide-eyed, to ancient tales of war and 
ghosts before the roaring winter fires in the mountain halls. All of it. He'd 
show her all of it. And walk onto those battlefields again and again to 
ensure he could. 

So Aedion smiled at Lysandra and brushed her hand with his own. "I'm 
glad we're in agreement, for once." 


Chapter 54


Aelin and Ansel clinked bottles of wine over the long, scarred table in the 
galley and drank deeply. 

They were to sail at first light tomorrow. North--back north. To 
Terrasen. 

Aelin braced her forearms on the slick table. "Here's to dramatic 
entrances." 

Lysandra, curled on the bench in ghost leopard form with her head on 
Aelin's lap, let out a little feline laugh. Ansel blinked in wonder. "So what 
now?" 

"Itd be nice," Aedion grumbled from down the table, where he and 
Rowan glared at them, "to be included in just one of these schemes, Aelin." 

"But your faces are so wonderful when I get to reveal them," Aelin 
crooned. 

He and Rowan growled. Oh, she knew they were pissed. So pissed that 
she hadn't told them about Ansel. But the thought of disappointing them, of 
failing ... She'd wanted to do this on her own. 

Rowan, apparently, mastered his annoyance enough to ask Ansel, "Were 
the ilken or Valg not in Melisande?" 

"Are you implying my forces weren't good enough to take the city if 
they had been?" Ansel swigged from her wine, laughter dancing in her 
eyes. Dorian sat at the table between Fenrys and Gavriel, the three of them 
wisely keeping quiet. Lorcan and Elide were on the deck--somewhere. 
"No, Prince," Ansel went on. "I asked the Queen of Melisande about the 
lack of Morath-bred horrors, and, after some coaxing, she informed me that 
through whatever wiles and scheming, she managed to keep Erawan's claws 
from her. And her soldiers." 

Aelin straightened a bit, wishing she'd had more wine than the third of a 
bottle she'd already consumed as Ansel added, "When this war is over, 


Melisande will not have the excuse of being in thrall to Erawan or the Valg. 
Everything she and her armies have done, their choice in allying with him, 
was a human choice." A pointed glance to the darkest part of the galley, 
where Manon Blackbeak sat alone. "At least Melisande will have the 
Ironteeth to commiserate with." 

Manon's iron teeth flashed in the dim light. Her wyvern hadn't been 
spotted or heard from since he'd left, apparently. And she and Elide had 
talked for over an hour on the deck this afternoon. 

Aelin decided to do them all a favor and cut in, "I need more men, 
Ansel. And I do not have the ability to be in so many places at once." They 
were all watching now. 

Ansel set down the bottle. "You want me to raise another army for 
you?" 

"I want you to find me the lost Crochan witches." 

Manon jerked upright. "What." 

Aelin scratched at a mark on the table. "They are in hiding, but they're 
still out there, if the Ironteeth hunt them. They might have significant 
numbers. Promise to share the Wastes with them. You control Briarcliff and 
half the coast. Give them inland and the South." 

Manon was prowling over, death in her eyes. "You do not have the right 
to promise such things." Rowan's and Aedion's hands shot to their swords. 
But Lysandra opened a sleepy eye, stretched out a paw on the bench, and 
revealed the needle-sharp claws that now stood between Manon's shins and 
Aelin. 

Aelin said to Manon, "You cannot hold the land, not with the curse. 
Ansel won it, through blood and loss and her own wits." 

"It is my home, my people's home--" 

"That was the asking price, wasn't it? The Ironteeth get their homeland 
returned, and Erawan probably promised to break the curse." At Manon's 
wide eyes, Aelin snorted. "Oh--the Ancients didn't tell you that, did they? 
Too bad. That's what Ansel's spies picked up." She looked the Wing Leader 
over. "If you and your people prove to be better than your Matrons, there 
will be a place for you in that land, too." 

Manon just stalked back to her seat and glared at the galley's small 
brazier as if she could freeze it over. 

Ansel murmured, "So touchy, these witches." 





Aelin clamped her lips together, but Lysandra let out another breathy cat 
laugh. Manon's nails clicked against each other from across the room. 
Lysandra merely answered with her own. 

Aelin said to Ansel, "Find the Crochans." 

"They're all gone," Manon cut in again. "We've hunted them to near- 
extinction." 

Aelin slowly looked over a shoulder. "What if their queen summoned 
them?" 

"T am no more their queen than you are." 

They'd see about that. Aelin laid a hand flat on the table. "Send 
anything and anyone you find north,' she said to Ansel. "Sacking 
Melisande's capital on the sly will at least piss off Erawan, but we don't 
want to be stuck down here when Terrasen is attacked." 

"I think Erawan was probably born pissed." Only Ansel, who had once 
laughed at death as she'd leaped a ravine and convinced Aelin to nearly die 
doing the same, would mock a Valg king. But Ansel added, "I'll do it. I 
don't know how effective it'll be, but I have to go north anyway. Though I 
think Hisli will be heartbroken to say farewell to Kasida once again." 

It was no surprise at all that Ansel had managed to hold on to Hisli, the 
Asterion mare she'd stolen for herself. But Kasida--oh, Kasida was just as 
beautiful as Aelin remembered, even more so once she'd been led over a 
gangway onto the ship. Aelin had brushed the mare down when she'd led 
her into the cramped, wet stables, and bribed the horse to forgive her with 
an apple. 

Ansel slugged from the bottle. "I heard, you know. When you went to 
Endovier. I was still fighting my way onto the throne, battling Lord Loch's 
horde with the lords I'd banded together, but ... even out in the Wastes, we 
heard when you were sent there." 

Aelin picked at the table some more, well aware the others were 
listening. "It wasn't fun." 

Ansel nodded. "Once Pd killed Loch, I had to stay to defend my throne, 
to make it right again for my people. But I knew if anyone could survive 
Endovier, itd be you. I set out last summer. I'd reached the Ruhnn 
Mountains when I got word you were gone. Taken to the capital by ..." She 
glanced at Dorian, stone-faced across the table. "Him. But I couldn't go to 


Rifthold. It was too far, and I had been gone too long. So I turned around. 
Went home." 

Aelin's words were strangled. "You tried to get me out?" 

The fire cast Ansel's hair in ruby and gold. "There was not one hour that 
I did not think about what I did in the desert. How you fired that arrow after 
twenty-one minutes. You told me twenty, that you'd shoot even if I wasn't 
out of range. I was counting; I knew how many it had been. You gave me an 
extra minute." 

Lysandra stretched out, nuzzling Ansel's hand. She idly scratched the 
shifter. 

Aelin said, "You were my mirror. That extra minute was as much for me 
as it was for you." Aelin clinked her bottle against Ansel's again. "Thank 
you." 

Ansel just said, "Don't thank me yet." 

Aelin straightened. The others halted their eating, utensils discarded in 
their stew. 

"The fires along the coast weren't set by Erawan," Ansel said, those 
red-brown eyes flickering in the lantern light. "We interrogated Melisande's 
Queen and her lieutenants, but ... it wasn't an order from Morath." 

Aedion's low growl told her they all knew the answer before Ansel 
replied. 

"We got a report that Fae soldiers were spied starting them. Firing from 
ships." 

"Maeve," Gavriel murmured. "But burning isn't her style." 

"It's mine," Aelin said. They all looked at her. She let out a humorless 
laugh. 

Ansel just nodded. "She's been setting them, blaming you for it." 

"To what end?" Dorian asked, dragging a hand through his blue-black 
hair. 

"To undermine Aelin," Rowan said. "To make her look like a tyrant, not 
a savior. Like a threat worth banding against, rather than allying with." 

Aelin sucked on a tooth. "Maeve plays the game well, PI give her 
that." 

"So she's reached these shores, then," Aedion said. "But where the hell 
is she?" 


A stone of fear plunked into Aelin's stomach. She couldn't bring herself 
to say north. To suggest that perhaps Maeve now sailed for undefended 
Terrasen. A glance at Fenrys and Gavriel revealed them already shaking 
their heads in silent answer to Rowan's pointed look. 

Aelin said, "We leave at first light." 


In the dim light of their private cabin an hour later, Rowan drew a line 
across the map spread in the center of the floor, then a second line beside it, 
then a third beside that. Three lines, roughly spaced apart, broad swaths of 
the continent between. Aelin, standing beside him, studied them. 

Rowan drew an inward arrow from the leftmost line toward the one in 
the center, and said quietly so the others in the adjacent rooms or hall 
couldn't hear, "Ansel and her army hammer from the western mountains." 
Another arrow in an opposite direction--toward the line on the far right. 
"Rolfe, the Mycenians, and this armada strike from the eastern coast." An 
arrow pointing down into the right section of his little drawing, where the 
two arrows would meet. "The Bane and the other half of Ansel's army 
sweep down the center, from the Staghorns, to the heart of the continent-- 
all converging on Morath." Those eyes were like green fire. "You've been 
moving armies into position." 

"I need more," she said. "And I need more time." 

His brows narrowed. "And what army will you be fighting in?" His 
mouth twitched up at a corner. "I assume I won't be able to persuade you to 
stay behind the lines." 

"You know better than to even try." 

"Where would the fun be, anyway, if I got to win all the glory while you 
sat on your ass? I'd never let you hear the end of it." 

She snorted, and surveyed the other maps they'd spread across the floor 
of their cabin. Together, they formed a patchwork of their world--not just 
the continent, but the lands beyond. She stood, towering over it, as if she 
could spy those armies, both near and far. 

Rowan, still kneeling, looked upon the world spread at her feet. 

And she realized it indeed was--if she won this war, won the continent 
back. 


Aelin scanned the sprawl of the world, which had once seemed so vast 
and now, at her feet, seemed so ... fragile. So small and breakable. 

"You could, you know," Rowan said, his tattoo stark in the lantern light. 
"Take it for yourself. Take it all. Use Maeve's bullshit maneuvers against 
her. Make good on that promise." 

There was no judgment. Only frank calculation and contemplation. 
"And would you join me if I did? If I turned conqueror?" 

"You would unify, not pillage and burn. And yes--to whatever end." 

"That's the threat, isn't it?" she mused. "The other kingdoms and 
territories will spend the rest of their existence wondering if I will one day 
grow restless in Terrasen. They will do their best to ensure we stay happily 
within our borders, and find them to be more useful as allies and trade 
partners than potential conquests. Maeve attacked Eyllwe's coast, posing as 
me, perhaps to turn those foreign lands against me--to hammer home the 
point I made with my power at Skull's Bay ... and use it against us." 

He nodded. "But if you could ... would you?" 

For a heartbeat, she could see it--see her face, carved into statues in 
kingdoms so far away they did not even know Terrasen existed. A living 
god--Mala's heir and conqueror of the known world. She would bring 
music and books and culture, wipe out the corruption festering in corners of 
the earth ... 

She said softly, "Not now." 

"But later?" 

"Perhaps if being queen bores me ... PI think about making myself 
empress. To give my offspring not one kingdom to inherit, but as many as 
the stars." 

There was no harm in saying it, anyway. In thinking about it, stupid and 
useless as it was. Even if wondering about the possibilities ... perhaps it 
made her no better than Maeve or Erawan. 

Rowan jerked his chin toward the nearest map--toward the Wastes. 
"Why did you forgive Ansel? After what she did to you and the others in 
the desert?" 

Aelin crouched again. "Because she made a bad choice, trying to heal a 
wound she couldn't ever mend. Trying to avenge the people she loved." 

"And you really set all this in motion when we were in Rifthold? When 
you were fighting in those pits?" 


She gave him a roguish wink. "I knew if I gave the name Ansel of 
Briarcliff, it'd somehow make its way to her that a red-haired young woman 
was using her name to slaughter trained soldiers in the Pits. And that she'd 
know it was me." 

"So the red hair back then--not just for Arobynn." 

"Not even close." Aelin frowned at the maps, dissatisfied she hadn't 
spotted any other armies hiding out around the world. 

Rowan dragged a hand through his hair. "Sometimes I wish I knew 
every thought in that head, each scheme and plot. Then I remember how 
much it delights me when you reveal it--usually when it's most likely to 
make my heart stop dead in my chest." 

"I knew you were a sadist." 

He kissed her mouth once, twice, then the tip of her nose, nipping it 
with his canines. She hissed and batted him away, and his deep chuckle 
rumbled against the wooden walls. "That's for not telling me," he said. 
"Again." 

But despite his words, despite everything, he looked so ... happy. So 
perfectly content and happy to be there, kneeling among those maps, the 
lantern down to its last dregs, the world going to hell. 

The joyless, cold male she'd first met, the one who had been waiting for 
an opponent good enough to bring him death ... He now looked at her with 
happiness in his face. 

She took his hand, gripping it hard. "Rowan." 

The spark died from his eyes. 

She squeezed his fingers. "Rowan, I need you to do something for me." 


Manon lay curled on her side in her narrow bed, unable to sleep. 

It was not from the piss-poor sleeping conditions--no, she'd slept in far 
worse, even considering the shoddily patched hole in the side of the wall. 

She stared at that gap in the wall, at the moonlight leaking in on the 
salty summer breeze. 

She would not go find the Crochans. No matter what the Terrasen 
Queen called her, admitting to her bloodline was different from ... claiming 


it. She doubted the Crochans would be willing to serve anyway, given that 
she'd killed their princess. Her own half sister. 

And even if the Crochans did choose to serve her, fight for her ... 
Manon put a hand to the thick scar now across her belly. The Ironteeth 
would not share the Wastes. 

But it was that mentality, she supposed as she twisted onto her back, 
peeling her hair from her sweat-sticky neck, that had sent them all into 
exile. 

She again peered through the gaps in that hole to the sea beyond. 
Waiting to spot a shadow in the night sky, to hear the boom of mighty 
wings. 

Abraxos should have been here already. She shut out the coiling dread 
in her stomach. 

But instead of wings, footsteps creaked in the hall outside. 

A heartbeat later, the door opened on near-silent hinges, then shut again. 
Locked. 

Manon didn't sit up as she said, "What are you doing here." 

The moonlight sifted through the king's blue-black hair. "You don't 
have chains anymore." 

She sat up at that, examining where the irons draped down the wall. "Is 
it more enticing for you if they're on?" 

Sapphire eyes seemed to glow in the dark as he leaned against the shut 
door. "Sometimes it is." 

She snorted, but found herself saying, "You never weighed in." 

"On what?" he asked, though he knew what she'd meant. 

"What I am. Who I am." 

"Does my opinion matter to you, witchling?" 

Manon stalked toward him, stopping a few feet away, aware of every 
inch of night between them. "You do not seem outraged that Aelin sacked 
Melisande without telling anyone, you do not seem to care that I am a 
Crochan--" 

"Do not mistake my silence for lack of feeling. I have good reason to 
keep my thoughts to myself." 

Ice glittered at his fingertips. Manon tracked it. "Will it be you or the 
queen against Erawan in the end, I wonder." 

"Fire against darkness makes for a better story." 


"Yes, but so would ripping a demon king to shreds without using your 
hands." 

A half smile. "I can think of better uses for my hands--invisible and 
flesh." 

An invitation and a question. She held his gaze. 

"Then finish what you started," Manon breathed. 

Dorian's answering smile was soft--edged with that glimmer of cruelty 
that made her blood heat as if the Fire-Queen herself had breathed flame 
into it. 

She let Dorian back her against the wall. Let him hold her gaze while he 
tugged the top laces of her white shirt free. 

One. By. One. 

Let him lean in to brush his mouth against her bare neck, right under her 
ear. 

Manon arched slightly at that caress. At the tongue that flicked against 
where his lips had been. Then he pulled back. Away. 

Even as those phantom hands continued to trail up her hips, over her 
waist. His mouth parted slightly, body trembling with restraint. Restraint, 
where most males took and took when she offered it, gorging themselves on 
her. But Dorian Havilliard said, "The Bloodhound was lying that night. 
What she said about your Second. I felt her lie--tasted it." 

Some tight part in her chest eased. "I don't want to talk about that." 

He stepped closer again, and those phantom hands trailed under her 
breasts. She gritted her teeth. "And what do you want to talk about, 
Manon?" 

She wasn't sure he'd ever said her name before. And the way he'd said 
it... 

"I don't want to talk at all," she countered. "And neither do you," she 
added with a pointed glance. 

Again, that dark, edged smile appeared. And when he stepped close 
once more, his hands replaced those phantom ones. 

Tracing her hips, her waist, her breasts. Unhurried, indolent circles that 
she allowed him to make, simply because no one had ever dared. Each 
brush of his skin against hers left a wake of fire and ice. She found herself 
transfixed by it--by each coaxing, luxurious stroke. She did not even 


consider objecting as Dorian slid off her shirt and surveyed her bare, scar- 
flecked flesh. 

His face turned ravenous as he took in her breasts, the plane of her 
stomach--the scar slicing across it. 

That hunger shifted into something icy and vicious: "You once asked 
me where I stand on the line between killing to protect and killing for 
pleasure." His fingers grazed the seam of the scar across her abdomen. "PI 
stand on the other side of the line when I find your grandmother." 

A chill ran down her body, peaking her breasts. He watched them, then 
circled a finger around one. Dorian bent, his mouth following the path 
where that finger had been. Then his tongue. She bit her lip against the 
groan rising up her throat, her hands sliding into the silken locks of his hair. 

His mouth was still around the tip of her breast as he again met her 
eyes, sapphire framed with ebony lashes, and said, "I want to taste every 
inch of you." 

Manon let go of all pretense of reason as the king lifted his head and 
claimed her mouth. 

And for all his wanting to taste her, as she opened for him, Manon 
thought the king tasted like the sea, like a winter morning, something so 
foreign and yet familiar it at last dragged that moan from deep in her. 

His fingers slid to her jaw, tipping her face to thoroughly take her 
mouth, every movement of his tongue a sensuous promise that had her 
arching into him. Had her meeting him stroke for stroke as he explored and 
teased until she could hardly think straight. 

She had never contemplated what it would be like--to yield control. 
And not have it be weakness, but a freedom. 

Dorian's hands slid down her thighs, as if savoring the muscle there, 
then around--cupping her backside, grinding her into every hard inch of 
him. The small noise in her throat was cut off as he hoisted her from the 
wall in a smooth movement. 

Manon wrapped her legs around his waist while he carried her to the 
bed, his mouth never leaving hers as he devoured and devoured her. As he 
spread her beneath him. As he freed her pants button by button, then slid 
them off. 

But Dorian pulled back at last, leaving her panting as he surveyed her, 
utterly bare before him. He caressed a finger along the inside of her thigh. 


Higher. "I wanted you from the first moment I saw you in Oakwald," he 
said, his voice low and rough. 

Manon reached up to peel off his shirt, white fabric sliding away to 
reveal tan skin and sculpted muscle. "Yes," was all she told him. She 
unbuckled his belt, hands shaking. "Yes," she said again, as Dorian brushed 
a knuckle over her core. He let out an approving growl at what he found. 

His clothes joined hers on the floor. Manon let him raise her arms over 
her head, his magic gently pinning her wrists to the mattress as he touched 
her, first with those wicked hands. Then with his wicked mouth. And when 
Manon had to bite his shoulder to muffle her moaning as he brought her 
over the edge, Dorian Havilliard buried himself deep inside her. 

She did not care who she was, who she had been, and what she had once 
promised to be as he moved. She dragged her hands through his thick hair, 
over the muscles of his back as it flexed and rippled with each thrust that 
drove her toward that shimmering edge again. Here, she was nothing but 
flesh and fire and iron; here, there was only this selfish need of her body, 
his body. 

More. She wanted more--wanted everything. 

She might have whispered it, might have pleaded for it. Because 
Darkness save her, Dorian gave it to her. To them both. 

He remained atop her when he at last stilled, his lips barely a 
hairsbreadth above hers--hovering after the brutal kiss he'd given her to 
contain his roar as release found him. 

She was trembling with ... whatever he'd done to her, her body. He 
brushed a strand of hair out of her face, his own fingers shaking. 

She had not realized how silent the world was--how loud they might 
have been, especially with so many Fae ears nearby. 

He was still atop her, in her. Those sapphire eyes flicked to her mouth, 
still panting slightly. "This was supposed to take the edge off." 

She kept her words low as his clothes slid over, hauled by phantom 
hands. "And did it?" 

He traced her lower lip with his thumb and shuddered as she sucked it 
into her mouth, flicked it with her tongue. "No. Not even close." 

But that was the gray light of dawn creeping into the room, staining the 
walls silver. He seemed to notice it at the same moment she did. Groaning 
softly, he pulled himself off her. She tugged on her clothes with trained 


efficiency, and only when she was lacing up her shirt did Dorian say, 
"We're not done, you and I." 

And it was the purely male promise that made her bare her teeth. 
"Unless you would like to learn precisely what parts of me are made of iron 
the next time you touch me, I decide those things." 

Dorian gave another purely male smile, brows flicking up, and 
sauntered out the door as silently as he'd arrived. He only seemed to pause 
on the threshold--as if some word had snagged his interest. But he 
continued out, the door closing with barely a click. Unruffled, utterly calm. 

Manon gaped after him, cursing her blood for heating again, for ... what 
she'd allowed him to do. 

She wondered what Dorian would say if she told him she had never 
allowed a male atop her like that. Not once. Wondered what he'd say if she 
told him she'd wanted to sink her teeth into his neck and find out what he 
tasted like. Put her mouth on other parts and see what he tasted like there. 

Manon dragged her hands through her hair and slumped onto the pillow. 

Darkness embrace her. 

She sent a silent prayer for Abraxos to return soon. Too much time--she 
had spent too much damn time among these humans and Fae males. She 
needed to leave. Elide was safe here--the Queen of Terrasen might be 
many things, but Manon knew she'd protect Elide. 

But, with the Thirteen scattered and likely dead, regardless of what 
Dorian had claimed, Manon wasn't entirely sure where to go once she left. 
The world had never seemed quite so vast before. 

And so empty. 


Even utterly exhausted, Elide barely slept during the long night she and 
Lorcan swayed in hammocks with the other sailors. The smells, the sounds, 
the rocking of the sea ... All of it nagged, none of it left her settled. A 
finger seemed to keep prodding her awake, as if telling her to be alert, but 
... there was nothing. 

Lorcan tossed and turned for hours. As if the same force begged him to 
wake. 

As if he was waiting for something. 


His strength had been flagging by the time they'd reached the ship, 
though he had showed no signs of strain beyond a slight tightening in his 
mouth. But Elide knew he was near what he'd described as a burnout. 
Knew, because for hours afterward, the small brace of magic around her 
ankle kept flickering in and out of place. 

After Manon had informed her of the uncertain fates of the Thirteen, 
Elide had kept mostly out of her companions' way, letting them talk with 
that red-haired young woman who found them on the beach. So had Lorcan. 
He'd listened to them debate and plan, his face taut, as if something coiled 
in him wound itself tighter with every passing moment. 

Watching him sleep mere feet away, that harsh face smoothed to 
softness by slumber, a small part of Elide wondered if she'd somehow 
brought another danger to the queen. She wondered if the others had noted 
how often Lorcan's gaze had been fixed on Aelin's back. Aimed at her back. 

As if sensing her attention, Lorcan opened his eyes. Met her stare 
without so much as blinking. For a heartbeat, she took in that depthless gaze 
mere feet away, made ethereal by the silver light before dawn. 

He had been willing to offer up his life for her own. 

Something softened in that harsh face as his eyes dipped to where her 
arm dangled out of her hammock, the skin still a bit sore, but ... 
miraculously healed. She'd thanked Gavriel twice now, but he'd brushed it 
aside with a gentle nod and shrug. 

A faint smile bloomed on Lorcan's harsh mouth as he reached across 
the space between them and ran his calloused fingers down her arm. "You 
choose this?" he murmured so that it was little more than the groaning of 
the hammock ropes. He brushed a thumb down her palm. 

Elide swallowed but let herself take in every line of that face. North-- 
they were going home today. "I thought that was obvious," she said with 
equal quiet, her cheeks heating. 

His fingers laced through hers, some emotion she couldn't place 
flickering like starlight in those black eyes. "We need to talk," he rasped. 

It was the shout of the watch that jolted them. The one of pure terror. 

Elide nearly flipped out of her hammock, the sailors rushing past. By 
the time she shoved her hair from her eyes, Lorcan was already gone. 

The various decks were packed, and she had to limp onto the stairs to 
view what had roused them. The other ships were awake and frenzied. With 


good reason. 

Sailing over the western horizon, another armada headed for them. 

And Elide knew in her bones it was not one that Aelin had schemed and 
planned for. 

Not as Fenrys breathed, suddenly beside her on the steps. "Maeve." 


Chapter 55


They had no choice but to meet them. Maeve's armada had the wind and the 
current, and they would not even reach the shore before they were caught. 
And outrunning Fae soldiers ... Not an option. 

Rowan and Aedion laid out every course for Aelin. All paths arrived at 
one destination: confrontation. And she was still so drained, so exhausted, 
that ... She knew how this would go. 

Maeve had a third more ships. And immortal warriors. With magic. 

It took far too little time for those black sails to fill the sky, for them to 
glean that their enemy's boats were better-made, their soldiers longer- 
trained. Rowan and the cadre had overseen much of that trainting--and the 
details they provided were not heartening. 

Maeve sent one ornately carved rowboat to them, bearing a message. 

Surrender--or be sent to the bottom of the ocean. Aelin had until dawn 
tomorrow to decide. 

An entire day. So that the fear would fester and spread among their men. 

Aelin met with Rowan and Aedion again. The cadre was not summoned 
by their queen, though Lorcan paced like a caged beast, Elide watching 
with a face that impressively revealed nothing. 

She had no solution. Dorian remained quiet, though he often glanced 
between her and Manon. As if some puzzle were laid before him. He never 
said what. 

Aedion pushed for attacking--quietly rallying the boats and attacking. 
But Maeve would see that maneuver coming. And they could strike faster 
with magic than it'd take for them to fire arrows and harpoons. 

Time. That was all she had to play with. 

They debated and theorized and planned. Rowan made a decent attempt 
at trying to suggest she run. She let him talk, only to let him realize in doing 


so what a stupid idea it was. After last night, he should be well aware she 
was not leaving him. Not willingly. 

So the sun set. And Maeve's armada waited, poised and watching. A 
lounging panther, ready to strike at first light. 

Time. Her only tool--and her downfall. And she had run out of it. 

Aelin counted those black sails again and again as night blanketed them. 

And had no idea what to do. 


It was unacceptable, Rowan had decided, during the long hours they'd 
debated. 

Unacceptable that they had done so much, only to be halted not by 
Erawan, but Maeve. 

She hadn't deigned to make an appearance. But that wasn't her style. 

She'd do it at dawn. Accept Aelin's surrender in person, with all eyes 
watching. And then ... Rowan didn't know what she'd do then. What 
Maeve wanted, other than the keys. 

Aelin had been so calm. Shock, he'd realized. Aelin had gone into 
shock. Rowan had seen her rage and kill and laugh and weep, but he had 
never seen her ... lost. And he hated himself for it, but he couldn't find a 
way out. Couldn't find a way for her to get out of this. 

Aelin was sleeping soundly as Rowan stared at the ceiling above their 
bed, then slid his gaze over her. He took in the lines of her face, the golden 
waves of her hair, every moon-white scar and dark swirl of ink. Leaning in, 
silent as snow in a wood, he kissed her brow. 

He would not let it end here, not let this be what broke them. 

He knew the house flags that flew beneath Maeve's own crest. Had 
counted and cataloged them all day, sorting through the catacombs of his 
memory. 

Rowan slid into his clothes and waited until he'd crept into the hall 
before buckling his sword belt. Still gripping the doorknob, he allowed 
himself one last look at her. 

For a moment, the past snared him--for a moment, he saw her as he'd 
first spied her on the rooftops of Varese, drunk and battered. He'd been in 


hawk form, assessing his new charge, and she'd noticed him--broken and 
reeling, she had still spotted him there. And stuck out her tongue at him. 

If someone had told him that the drunken, brawling, bitter woman 
would become the one thing he could not live without ... Rowan shut the 
door. 

This was all he could offer her. 

Rowan reached the main deck and shifted, little more than a gleam of 
moonlight as he shielded himself and flapped through the briny night--into 
the heart of Maeve's fleet. 


Rowan's cousin had enough good sense not to try to kill him on sight. 

They were close enough in age that Rowan had grown up with him, 
raised in his uncle's house beside him after his parents had faded. If his 
uncle ever faded, it would be Enda who took up the mantle as head of their 
house--a prince of considerable title, property, and arms. 

Enda, to his credit, sensed his arrival before Rowan slipped through the 
flimsy shield on the windows. And Enda remained sitting on the bed, albeit 
dressed for battle, a hand on his sword. 

His cousin looked him over head to toe as Rowan shifted. "Assassin or 
messenger, Prince?" 

"Neither," Rowan said, inclining his head slightly. 

Like him, Enda was silver-haired, though his green eyes were speckled 
with brown that could sometimes swallow the color whole when he was in a 
rage. 

If Rowan had been bred and built for battlefields, Enda was sculpted for 
intrigue and court machinations. His cousin, while tall and muscled enough, 
lacked Rowan's breadth of shoulders and solid bulk--though that could 
also be from the different sorts of training they'd received. Enda knew 
enough about fighting to warrant being here to lead his father's forces, but 
their own educations had crossed little after those first decades of youth, 
when they had run wild together at his family's main estate. 

Enda kept his hand on the hilt of his fine sword, utterly calm. "You look 
... different," his cousin said, brows twitching toward each other. "Better." 


There had been a time when Enda had been his friend--before Lyria. 
Before ... everything. And Rowan might have been inclined to explain who 
and what was responsible for this change, but he didn't have time. No, time 
was not his ally this night. 

But Rowan said, "You look different as well, Prince." 

Enda gave a half smile. "You can thank my mate for that." 

Once, it might have sent a pang of agony through him. That Enda spoke 
of it reminded him that his cousin might not be a battle-honed warrior, but 
the courtier was as good as any at marking important details--noting 
Aelin's scent, now forever entwined with his own. So Rowan nodded, 
smiling a bit himself. "It was Lord Kerrigan's son, wasn't it?" 

Indeed, there was another's scent woven through Enda's, the claiming 
deep and true. "It was." Enda again smiled--now at a ring on his finger. 
"We were mated and married earlier this summer." 

"You mean to tell me you waited a hundred years for him?" 

Enda shrugged, his grip on his sword lightening. "When it comes to the 
right person, Prince, waiting a hundred years is worth it." 

He knew. He understood him so damn well that it made his chest crack 
to think of it. 

"Endymion," he said hoarsely. "Enda, I need you to listen." 

There were plenty of people who might have called for the guards, but 
he knew Enda--or had. He was but one of several cousins who'd shoved 
their noses into his business for years. Tried, Rowan now wondered, not for 
gossip but ... to fight to keep some small scrap of him alive. Enda more 
than any of them. 

So Endymion gave him the gift of listening. Rowan tried to keep it 
concise, tried to keep his hands from trembling. In the end, he supposed his 
request was simple. 

When he finished, Enda studied him, any response hidden behind that 
court-trained mask of neutrality. 

Then Enda said, "I will consider it." 

It was the best Rowan could hope for. He said nothing else to his cousin 
before he shifted again and flapped into the night--toward another banner 
he had once marched beside. 

And ship to ship, Rowan went. The same speech. The same request. 

All of them, all his cousins, had the same answer. 


I will consider it. 


Chapter 56


Manon was awake when Dorian stormed into her room an hour before 
dawn. He ignored her unlaced shirt, the swell of those lush breasts he'd 
tasted only yesterday, as he said, "Put your clothes on and follow me." 

Mercifully, the witch obeyed. Though he had a feeling it was mostly 
from curiosity. 

When he reached Aelin's chamber, he bothered to knock--just in case 
the queen and Rowan were utilizing their potentially last few hours 
together. But the queen was already awake and dressed, the prince nowhere 
to be found. Aelin took one look at Dorian's face. "What is 1t?" 

He didn't tell either woman anything as he led them down into the cargo 
hold, the upper levels of the ship already astir with battle preparations. 

While they'd debated and readied for the past day, he'd contemplated 
Manon's warning, after she'd made his very blood sing with pleasure. 
Unless you would like to learn precisely what parts of me are made of iron 
the next time you touch me, I decide those things. 

Over and over, he'd considered the way the words had snagged on a 
sharp corner of memory. He'd lain awake all night while he descended into 
his still-depleted well of magic. And as the light had begun to shift ... 

Dorian tugged the sheet off the witch mirror carefully held in place 
against the wall. The Lock--or whatever it was. In the muted reflection, the 
two queens were frowning at his back. 

Manon's iron nails slid out. "I would be careful handling that if I were 
you." 

"The warning is noted and appreciated," he said, meeting those gold 
eyes in the mirror. She didn't return his smile. Neither did Aelin. He sighed. 
"I don't think this witch mirror has any power. Or, rather, not a tangible, 
brute power. I think its power is knowledge." 


Aelin's steps were near-silent as she approached. "I was told the Lock 
would allow me to bind the three keys into the gate. You think this mirror 
knows how to do that?" 

He simply nodded, trying not to be too offended by the skepticism 
scrunching her face. 

Aelin picked at a loose thread on her jacket. "But what does the Lock- 
mirror-whatever-it-is have to do with the armada breathing down our 
necks?" 

He tried not to roll his eyes. "It has to do with what Deanna said. What 
if the Lock wasn't just for binding them back into the gate, but a tool for 
safely controlling the keys?" 

Aelin frowned at the mirror. "So I'm going to lug that thing onto the 
deck and use it to blow apart Maeve's armada with the two keys we have?" 

He took a steadying breath, beseeching the gods for patience. "I said I 
think this mirror's power is knowledge. I think it will show you how to 
wield the keys safely. So you can come back here and wield them without 
consequence." 

A slow blink. "What do you mean, come back here?" 

Manon answered, now stepping close as she studied the mirror. "It's a 
traveling mirror." 

Dorian nodded. "Think about Deanna's words: 'Flame and iron, 
together bound, merge into silver to learn what must be found. A mere step 
is all it shall take.'" He pointed to the mirror. "Step into the silver--and 
learn." 

Manon clicked her tongue. "And I suppose she and I are flame and 
iron." 

Aelin crossed her arms. 

Dorian cut the Queen of Terrasen a wry glance. "People other than you 
can solve things, you know." 

Aelin glared at him. "We don't have time for what-ifs. Too many things 
could go wrong." 

"You have little magic left," Dorian countered, waving a hand toward 
the mirror. "You could be in and out of this mirror before dawn. And use 
what you learn to send Maeve a message in no uncertain terms." 

"I can still fight with steel--without the risks and waste of time." 


"You can stop this battle before the losses are too great on either side." 
He added carefully, "We're out of time already, Aelin." 

Those turquoise eyes were steady--if not still furious he'd beat her to 
the riddle--but something flickered in them. "I know," she said. "I was 
hoping ..." She shook her head, more at herself. "I ran out of time," she 
murmured as if it were an answer, and considered the mirror, then Manon. 
Then blew out a breath. "This wasn't my plan." 

"I know," Dorian said with a half smile. "That's why you don't like it." 

Manon asked before Aelin could bite off his head, "But where will the 
mirror lead?" 

Aelin clenched her jaw. "Hopefully not Morath." Dorian tensed. 
Perhaps this plan-- 

"That symbol belongs to both of us," Manon said, studying the Eye of 
Elena etched onto it. "And if it takes you to Morath, you're going to need 
someone who knows the way out." 

Steps thudded down the stairs at the back of the hold. Dorian twisted 
toward them, but Aelin smirked at Manon and approached the mirror. 
"Then Ill see you on the other side, witch." 

Aedion's golden head appeared between the crates. "What the hell are 
you--" 

Aelin's shallow nod seemed all that Manon needed. She placed her hand 
atop Aelin's. 

Golden eyes met Dorian's for a moment, and he opened his mouth to 
say something to her, the words surging from some barren field in his chest. 

But Aelin and Manon pressed their joined hands to the speckled glass. 

Aedion's shout of warning rang through the hold as they vanished. 





Chapter 57


Elide watched the ship rally against the armada looming before them--then 
descend into utter chaos as Aedion began roaring below. 

The news came out moments later. Came out as Prince Rowan 
Whitethorn landed on the main deck, face haggard, eyes full of nothing but 
fear as Aedion burst out the door, Dorian on his heels, sporting an already- 
nasty bruise around his eye. Pacing, seething, Aedion told them of Aelin 
and Manon walking into the mirror--the Lock--and vanishing. How the 
King of Adarlan had solved Deanna's riddle and sent them into its silvery 
realm to buy them a shot at this battle. 

They went down into the cargo hold. But no matter how Aedion pushed 
against the mirror, it did not open to him. No matter how Rowan searched it 
with his magic, it did not yield where Aelin and Manon had gone. Aedion 
had spat on the floor, looking inclined to give the king another black eye as 
Dorian explained there had been little choice. He hadn't seemed sorry about 
it--until Rowan refused to meet his gaze. 

Only when they were gathered on the deck again, the king and shape- 
shifter off speaking to the captain about the turn of events, did Elide 
carefully say to Aedion as he paced, "What is done is done. We can't wait 
for Aelin and Manon to find a way to save us." 

Aedion halted, and Elide tried not to cringe at the unrelenting fury as it 
narrowed on her. "When I want your opinion about how to deal with my 
missing queen, I'Il ask you." 

Lorcan snarled at him. But Elide lifted her chin, even as the insult hit 
something in her chest. "I waited as long as you did to find her again, 
Aedion. You are not the only one who fears to lose her once more." 

Indeed, Rowan Whitethorn now rubbed his face. She suspected it was as 
much feeling as the Fae Prince would show. 





Rowan lowered his hands, the others watching him. Waiting--for his 
orders. 

Even Aedion. 

Elide started as realization slapped her. As she searched for proof but 
found none. 

"We continue readying for battle," Rowan said hoarsely. He looked to 
Lorcan, then Fenrys and Gavriel, and his entire countenance changed, his 
shoulders pushing back, his eyes turning hard and calculating. "There's not 
a chance in hell Maeve doesn't know you're here. She'll wield the blood 
oath when it'Il hurt us the most." 

Maeve. Some small part of her wished to see the queen who could 
command Lorcan's relentless focus and affection for so many centuries. 
And perhaps give Maeve a piece of her mind. 

Fenrys put a hand on the hilt of his sword and said with more quiet than 
Elide had witnessed so far, "I don't know how to play this one." 

Indeed, Gavriel seemed at a loss, scanning his tattooed hands as if the 
answer lay there. 

It was Lorcan who said, "If you're spotted fighting on this side, it's 
over. She' ll either kill you both or make you regret it in other ways." 

"And what about you?" Fenrys challenged. 

Lorcan's eyes slid to hers, then back to the males before them. "It was 
over for me months ago. It's now a matter of waiting to see what she'll do 
about it." 

If she'd kill him. Or drag him back in chains. 

Elide's stomach turned, and she avoided the urge to grab his hand, to 
beg him to run. 

"She'll see that we've worked our way around her order to kill you," 
Gavriel at last said. "If fighting on this side of the line doesn't damn us 
enough, then that surely will. It likely already has." 

"Dawn's still half an hour off, if you two want to try again," Lorcan 
crooned. 

Elide tensed. But it was Fenrys who said, "It's all a ploy." Elide held her 
breath as he surveyed the Fae males--his companions. "To fracture us when 
Maeve knows that unified, we could present a considerable threat." 

"We'd never turn on her," Gavriel countered. 


"No," Fenrys agreed. "But we would offer that strength to another." 
And he looked at Rowan as he said, "When we got your call for aid this 
spring--when you asked us to come defend Mistward, we left before 
Maeve could get wind of it. We ran." 

"That's enough," Lorcan growled. 

But Fenrys went on, holding Rowan's steady gaze, "When we returned, 
Maeve whipped us within an inch of our lives. Tied Lorcan to the posts for 
two days and let Cairn whip him whenever he wished. Lorcan ordered us 
not to tell you--for whatever reason. But I think Maeve saw what we did 
together in Mistward and realized how dangerous we could be--to her." 

Rowan didn't hide the devastation in his eyes as he faced Lorcan-- 
devastation that Elide felt echo in her own heart. Lorcan had endured that 
... and still remained loyal to Maeve. Elide brushed her fingers against his. 
The motion didn't go unnoticed by the others, but they wisely kept quiet 
about it. Especially as Lorcan dragged his thumb down the back of her hand 
in answer. 

And Elide wondered if Rowan also understood that Lorcan hadn't 
ordered their silence for strategy, but perhaps to spare the prince from guilt. 
From wanting to retaliate against Maeve in a way that would surely harm 
him. 

"Did you know," Rowan said hoarsely to Lorcan, "that she'd punish you 
before you came to Mistward?" 

Lorcan held the prince's stare. "We all knew what the cost would be." 

Rowan's throat bobbed, and he took a long breath, his eyes darting 
toward the stairs, as if Aelin would come prowling out, salvation in hand. 
But she didn't, and Elide prayed that wherever the queen now was, she was 
gleaning what they so desperately needed to learn. Rowan said to his 
companions, "You know how this battle will likely end. Even if our armada 
teemed with Fae soldiers, we'd still have the odds stacked against us." 

The sky began to bleed with pink and purple as the sun stirred beneath 
the distant waves. 

Gavriel only said, "We have had the odds stacked against us before." A 
glance at Fenrys, who nodded gravely. "We will stay until we are 
commanded otherwise." 

It was to Aedion that Gavriel looked as he said this last piece. There 
was something in the general's Ashryver eyes that looked almost like 


gratitude. 

Elide sensed Lorcan's attention and found him still watching her as he 
said to Rowan, "Elide gets to shore, under a guard of whatever men you can 
spare. My sword is yours only if you do that." 

Elide started. But Rowan said, "Done." 


Rowan spread them across the fleet, each given command of a few ships. 
He stationed Fenrys, Lorcan, and Gavriel on ships toward the center and 
back, farthest away from Maeve's notice. He and Aedion took the front 
lines, with Dorian and Ansel commanding the line of ships behind his. 

Lysandra was already beneath the waves in sea dragon form, ready for 
his order to do damage to hull and prow and rudder on ships he'd marked 
for her. He'd bet that while the Fae ships might have shields around them, 
they wouldn't waste valuable reservoirs of power on shielding below the 
surface. Lysandra would strike quick and hard--gone before they could 
realize who and what wrecked them from below. 

Dawn broke, clear and bright, staining the sails with gold. 

Rowan did not let himself think of Aelin--of wherever she might be. 

Minute after minute passed, and still Aelin did not return. 

A small oak rowboat slid out from Maeve's fleet and headed for him. 

There were only three people on it--none of them Maeve. 

He could feel thousands of eyes on either side of that too-narrow band 
of empty water between their armadas, watching that boat approach. 
Watching him. 

A male in Maeve's livery stood with preternatural Fae balance as the 
oarsmen held the boat steady. "Her Majesty awaits your reply." 

Rowan tunneled into his depleted reserve of power, keeping his face 
bland. "Inform Maeve that Aelin Galathynius is no longer present to give a 
reply." 

A blink from the male was all the shock he'd let show. Maeve's 
creatures were too well trained, too aware of the punishment for revealing 
her secrets. 

"Princess Aelin Galathynius is ordered to surrender," the male said. 


"Queen Aelin Galathynius is not on this ship or any other in this fleet. 
She is, in fact, not on the shore, or in any nearby lands. So Maeve will find 
she came a long way for nothing. We will leave your armada in peace, if 
you will grant us the same courtesy." 

The male sneered up at him. "Spoken like cowards who know they're 
outnumbered. Spoken like a traitor." 

Rowan gave the male a small smile. "Let's see what Maeve has to say 
now." 

The male spat into the water. But the ship rowed back into the embrace 
of the armada. 

For a moment, Rowan recalled his last words to Dorian before he'd sent 
the king to shield his own line of ships. 

They were beyond apologies. Aelin would either return or--he didn't 
let himself consider the alternative. But they could buy her as much time as 
possible. Try to fight their way out--for her, and the future of this armada. 

Dorian's face had revealed the same thoughts as he clasped hands with 
him and said quietly, "It is not such a hard thing, is it--to die for your 
friends." 

Rowan didn't bother insisting they were going to live through this. The 
king had been tutored in warfare, even if he hadn't yet practiced it. So 
Rowan had given him a grim smile and replied, "No, it is not." 

The words echoed through him again as that messenger's boat 
disappeared. And for whatever good it would do, whatever time it would 
buy them, Rowan reinforced his shields again. 

The sun had fully risen over the horizon when Maeve's reply came. 

Not a messenger in a longboat. 

But a barrage of arrows, so many that they blotted out the light as they 
arced across the sky. 

"Shield," Rowan bellowed, not only at the magic-wielders, but also at 
the armed men who raised their dented and battered shields above them as 
arrows rained across the line. 

The arrows struck, and his magic buckled under their onslaught. Their 
tips had been wrapped in magic of their own, and Rowan gritted his teeth 
against it. On other ships, where the shield was stretched thin, some men 
screamed. 

Maeve's armada began crawling toward them. 

Chapter 58


Aelin had a body that was not a body. 

She knew only because in this void, this foggy twilight, Manon had a 
body. A nearly transparent, wraithlike body, but ... a form nonetheless. 

Manon's teeth and nails glinted in the dim light as she surveyed the 
swirling gray mists. "What is this place?" The mirror had transported them 
to ... wherever this was. 

"Your guess is as good as mine, witch." 

Had time stopped beyond the mists? Had Maeve held her fire upon 
learning she was not present--or attacked anyway? Aelin had no doubt 
Rowan would hold the lines for as long as possible. Had no doubt he and 
Aedion would lead them. But ... 

Whether the witch mirror was the Lock she'd sought, she'd expected it 
to have some immediate reaction to the two Wyrdkeys she'd snuck into her 
jacket. 

Not ... this. Not absolutely nothing. 

Aelin drew Goldryn. In the mist, the sword's ruby flickered--the only 
color, only light. 

Manon said, "We stick close; we only speak when necessary." 

Aelin was inclined to agree. There was solid ground beneath them, but 
the mist hid her feet--hid any inkling that they stood on dirt beyond a faint, 
crumbling scraping. 

"Any guess which way?" Aelin murmured. But they didn't have to 
decide. 

The eddying fog darkened, and Manon and Aelin stepped close 
together, back to back. Pure night swept around them--blinding them. 

Then--a murky, dim light ahead. No, not ahead. Approaching them. 
Manon's bony shoulder dug into her own as they pressed tighter together, 
an impenetrable wall. 


But the light rippled and expanded, figures within it appearing. 
Solidifying. 

Aelin knew three things as the light and color enveloped them and 
became tangible: 

They were not seen, or heard, or scented by those before them. 

And this was the past. A thousand years ago, to be exact. 

And that was Elena Galathynius on her knees in a black barren 
mountain pass, blood dripping from her nose, tears sliding through the dirt 
crusting her face to splatter on her armor, an obsidian sarcophagus 
somehow stationed before her. 

All across the sarcophagus, Wyrdmarks simmered with pale blue fire. 
And in the center of it ... the Eye of Elena, the amulet held within the stone 
itself, its pale gold unvarnished and gleaming. 

Then, as if a phantom breath blew over it, the Eye dimmed, along with 
the Wyrdmarks. 

Elena reached with a trembling hand to twist the Eye, rotating it thrice 
in the black stone. The Eye clicked and tumbled into Elena's awaiting hand. 
Sealing the sarcophagus. 

Locking it. 

"You've had the Lock all along,' Manon murmured. "But then the 
mirror ..." 

"T think," Aelin breathed, "we have been deliberately misled about what 
we must retrieve." 

"Why?" Manon said with equal quiet. 

"I suppose we're about to find out." 

A memory--that's what this was. But what was so vital that they had 
been sent to retrieve it when the whole damn world was falling apart around 
them? 

Aelin and Manon stood in silence as the scene unfolded. As the truth, at 
last the truth, now wove together. 


Chapter 59


Dawn at the Obsidian Passes 


The Lock had crafted the sarcophagus from the mountain itself. 

It had taken every ember of its power to bind Erawan within the stone, 
to seal him inside. 

She could feel the Dark King sleeping within. Hear the shrieks of his 
fell army feasting on human flesh in the valley far below. How long would 
they continue fighting when word spread that Erawan had fallen? 

She wasn't foolish enough to hope her companions had survived the 
slaughter. Not this long. 

On her knees in the sharp black rock, Elena gazed at the obsidian 
sarcophagus, the symbols carved into it. They initially had been glowing, 
but had now faded and cooled, settled into place. When she had stolen the 
Lock from her father all those months ago, she had not known--had not 
understood--the truth depth of its power. Still did not know why he had 
forged it. Only that once, just once, could the Lock's power be wielded. 
And that power ... oh, that mighty, shattering power ... it had saved them 
all. 

Gavin, sprawled and bloody behind her, stirred. His face was so 
mangled she could barely see the handsome, fierce features beneath. His 
left arm was useless at his side. The price of distracting Erawan while she'd 
unleashed the Lock's power. But even Gavin had not known what she'd 
been planning. What she'd stolen and harbored all these months. 

She did not regret it. Not when it had spared him from death. Worse. 

Gavin took in the sarcophagus, the empty, intricate amulet of the Lock 
in her palm as it rested on her thigh. He recognized it instantly, having seen 
it around her father's neck during those initial weeks in Orynth. The blue 


stone in its center was now drained, dim where it had once flickered with 
inner fire. Barely a drop of its power left, if that. 

"What have you done?" His voice was a broken rasp from screaming 
during Erawan's ministrations. To buy her time, to save their people-- 

Elena folded her fingers into a fist around the Lock. "He is sealed. He 
cannot escape." 

"Your father's Lock--" 

"It is done," she said, shifting her attention to the dozen ancient, 
immortal figures now on the other side of the sarcophagus. 

Gavin started, hissing at his broken body with the sudden movement. 

They had no forms. They were only figments of light and shadow, wind 
and rain, song and memory. Each individual, and yet a part of one majority, 
one consciousness. 

They were all gazing at the broken Lock in her hands, its stone dull. 

Gavin lowered his brow to the blood-soaked rock and averted his eyes. 

Elena's very bones quailed in their presence, but she kept her chin high. 

"Our sister's bloodline has betrayed us," said one that was of sea and 
sky and storms. 

Elena shook her head, trying to swallow. Failing. "I saved us. I stopped 
Erawan--" 

"Fool," said the one of many shifting voices, both animal and human. 
"Half-breed fool. Did you not consider why your father carried it, why he 
bided his time all these years, gathering his strength? He was to wield it--to 
seal the three Wyrdkeys back into the gate, and send us home before he shut 
the gate forever. Us, and the Dark King. The Lock was forged for us-- 
promised to us. And you wasted it." 

Elena braced a hand on the earth to keep from swaying. "My father 
bears the Wyrdkeys?" He had never so much as hinted ... And the Lock ... 
she had thought it a mere weapon. A weapon he had refused to wield in this 
bloody war. 

They did not answer, their silence confirmation enough. 

A small, broken noise came out of her throat. Elena breathed, "I'm 
sorry." 

Their rage rattled her bones, threatened to stop her heart dead in her 
chest. The one of flame and light and ashes seemed to withhold, seemed to 
pause in her wrath. 


To remember. 

She had not seen or spoken to her mother since she had left her body to 
forge the Lock. Since Rhiannon Crochan had helped Mala cast her very 
essence into it, the mass of its power contained within the small witch 
mirror disguised as a blue stone, to be unleashed only once. They had never 
told Elena why. Never said it was anything more than a weapon that her 
father would one day desperately need to wield. 

The cost: her mother's mortal body, the life she had wanted for herself 
with Brannon and their children. It had been ten years since then. Ten years, 
her father had never stopped waiting for Mala to return, hoping he'd see her 
again. Just once. 

I will not remember you, Mala had said to them all before she had given 
herself to the Lock's forging. And yet there she was. Pausing. As if she 
remembered. 

"Mother," Elena whispered, a broken plea. 

Mala Light-Bringer looked away from her. 

The one who saw all with wise, calm eyes said, "Unleash him. So we 
have been betrayed by these earth beasts, let us return the favor. Unleash the 
Dark King from his coffin." 

"No," Elena pleaded, rising from her knees. "Please--please. Tell me 
what I must do to atone, but please do not unleash him. I beg you." 

"He will rise again one day," said the one of darkness and death. "He 
will awaken. You have wasted our Lock on a fool's errand, when you could 
have solved all, had you only the patience and wits to understand." 

"Then let him awaken,' Elena begged, her voice breaking. "Let 
someone else inherit this war--someone better prepared." 

"Coward," said the one with a voice of steel and shields and arrows. 
"Coward to shove the burden to another." 

"Please," Elena said. "I will give you anything. Anything. But not that." 

As one, they looked to Gavin. 

No-- 

But it was her mother who said, "We have waited this long to return 
home. We may wait a little longer. Watch over this ... place a little longer." 

Not just gods, but beings of a higher, different existence. For whom 
time was fluid, and bodies were things to be shifted and molded. Who could 


exist in multiple places, spread themselves wide like nets being thrown. 
They were as mighty and vast and eternal as a human was to a mayfly. 

They had not been born in this world. Perhaps had become trapped here 
after wandering through a Wyrdgate. And they had struck some bargain 
with her father, with Mala, to at last send them home, banishing Erawan 
with them. And she had ruined it. 

The one with three faces said, "We will wait. But there must be a price. 
And a promise." 

"Name it," Elena said. If they took Gavin, she'd follow. She was not the 
heir to her father's throne. It did not matter if she walked out of this 
mountain pass. She wasn't entirely certain she could bear to see him again, 
not after her arrogance and pride and self-righteousness. Brannon had 
begged her to listen, to wait. She had instead stolen the Lock from him and 
run with Gavin into the night, desperate to save these lands. 

The one with three faces studied her. "Mala's bloodline shall bleed 
again to forge the Lock anew. And you will lead them, a lamb to slaughter, 
to pay the price of this choice you made to waste its power here, for this 
petty battle. You will show this future scion how to forge a new Lock with 
Mala's gifts, how to then use it to wield the keys and send us home. Our 
original bargain still holds: we will take the Dark King with us. Tear him 
apart in our own world, where he will be but dust and memory. When we 
are gone--you will show this scion how to seal the gate behind us, the Lock 
holding it intact eternally. By yielding every last drop of their life force. As 
your father was prepared to do when the time was right." 

"Please," Elena breathed. 

The three-faced one said, "Tell Brannon of the Wildfire what occurred 
here; tell him the price his bloodline shall one day pay. Tell him to ready for 
it." 

She let the words, the damnation, sink in. "I will," she whispered. 

But they were gone. There was only a lingering warmth, as if a beam of 
sunlight had brushed her cheek. 

Gavin lifted his head. "What have you done?" he asked again. "What 
have you given them?" 

"Did you not--not hear it?" 

"Only you," he rasped, his face so horribly pale. "No others." 


She stared at the sarcophagus before them, its black stone rooted to the 
earth of the pass. Immovable. They would have to build something around 
it, to hide it, protect it. 

Elena said, "The price will be paid--later." 

"Tell me." His swollen, split lips could barely form the words. 

Since she had already damned herself, damned her bloodline, she 
figured there was nothing left to lose in lying. Not this one time, this last 
time. "Erawan will awaken again--one day. When the time comes, I will 
help those who must fight him." 

His eyes were wary. 

"Can you walk?" she asked, extending a hand to help him rise. The 
rising sun cast the black mountains in gold and red. She had no doubt the 
valley behind was bathed in the latter. 

Gavin released his grip, the fingers still broken, from where it had 
rested on Damaris's hilt. But he did not take her offered hand. 

And he did not tell her what he'd detected while he touched the Sword 
of Truth, what lies he'd sensed and unraveled. 

They never spoke of them again. 


Moonrise at the Temple of Sandrian, the Stone Marshes 


The Princess of Eyllwe had been wandering the Stone Marshes for weeks, 
searching for answers to riddles posed a thousand years ago. Answers that 
might save her doomed kingdom. 

Keys and gates and locks--portals and pits and prophecies. That was 
what the princess murmured to herself in the weeks she'd been stalking 
through the marshes alone, hunting to keep herself alive, fighting the beasts 
of teeth and venom when necessary, reading the stars for entertainment. 

So when the princess at last reached the temple, when she stood before 
the stone altar and the chest that was the light twin to the dark one beneath 
Morath, she at last appeared. 

"You are Nehemia," she said. 

The princess whirled, her hunting leathers stained and damp, the gold 
tips on her braided hair clinking. 


An assessing look with eyes that were too old for barely eighteen; eyes 
that had stared long into the darkness between the stars and yearned to 
know its secrets. "And you are Elena." 

Elena nodded. "Why have you come?" 

The Princess of Eyllwe jerked her elegant chin toward the stone chest. 
"Am I not called to open it? To learn how to save us, and to pay the price?" 

"No," Elena said quietly. "Not you. Not in this way." 

A tightening of her lips was the only sign of the princess's displeasure. 
"Then in what way, Lady, am I required to bleed?" 

She had been watching, and waiting, and paying for her choices for so 
long. Too long. 

And now that darkness had fallen ... now a new sun would rise. Must 
rise. 

"Tt is Mala's bloodline that will pay, not your own." 

Her back stiffened. "You have not answered my question." 

Elena wished she could hold back the words, keep them locked up. But 
this was the price, for her kingdom, her people. The price for these people, 
this kingdom. And others. 

"In the North, two branches flow from Mala. One to the Havilliard 
House, where its prince with my mate's eyes possesses my raw magic--and 
her brute power. The other branch flows through the Galathynius House, 
where it bred true: flame and embers and ashes." 

"Aelin Galathynius is dead," Nehemia said. 

"Not dead." No, she'd ensured that, still paying for what she'd done that 
wintry night. "Just hiding, forgotten by a world grateful to see such a power 
extinguished before it matured." 

"Where is she? And how does this tie to me, Lady?" 

"You are versed in the history, in the players and the stakes. You know 
the Wyrdmarks and how to wield them. You misread the riddles, thinking it 
was you who must come here, to this place. This mirror is not the Lock--it 
is a pool of memory. Forged by myself, my father, and Rhiannon Crochan. 
Forged so the heir of this burden might understand one day. Know 
everything before deciding. This encounter, too, shall be held in it. But you 
were called, so we might meet." 

That wise, young face waited. 


"Go north, Princess," Elena said. "Go into your enemy's household. 
Make the contacts, get the invitation, do what you must, but get to your 
enemy's house. The two bloodlines will converge there. Already, they are 
on their way." 

"Aelin Galathynius is headed to Adarlan?" 

"Not Aelin. Not with that name, that crown. Know her by her eyes-- 
turquoise with a core of gold. Know her by the mark on her brow--the 
bastard's mark, the mark of Brannon. Guide her. Help her. She will need 
you." 

"And the price?" 

Elena hated them, then. 

Hated the gods who had demanded this. Hated herself. Hated that this 
was asked, all these bright lights ... 

"You will not see Eyllwe again." 

The princess stared at the stars as if they spoke to her, as if the answer 
were written there. "Will my people survive?" A small, quiet voice. 

"T don't know." 

"Then I will take the steps for that, too. Unite the rebels while I am in 
Rifthold, ready the continent for war." 

Nehemia lowered her eyes from the stars. Elena wanted to fall to her 
knees before the young princess, beg her forgiveness. "One of them must be 
ready--to do what needs to be done," Elena said, if only because it was the 
sole way to explain, to apologize. 

Nehemia swallowed. "Then I shall help in whatever way I can. For 
Erilea. And my people." 


Chapter 60


Aedion Ashryver had been trained to kill men and hold a line in battle since 
he was old enough to lift a sword. Crown Prince Rhoe Galathynius had 
begun his training personally, holding Aedion to standards that some might 
have deemed unfair, too unyielding for a boy. 

But Rhoe had known, Aedion realized as he stood on the prow of the 
ship, Ansel of Briarcliff's men armed and ready behind him. Rhoe had 
known even then that Aedion would serve Aelin, and when foreign armies 
challenged the might of the Fire-Bringer ... it might not be mere mortals 
that he faced. 

Rhoe--Evalin--had gambled that the immortal army now stretching 
away before him would one day come to these shores. And they had wanted 
to ensure that Aedion was ready when it did. 

"Shields up," Aedion ordered the men as the second volley of arrows 
rained from Maeve's armada. The magical cloak around their ships was 
holding well enough thanks to Dorian Havilliard, and though he was glad 
for any bloodshed it spared them, after the bullshit the king had pulled with 
Aelin and Manon, Aedion gritted his teeth at each ripple of color upon 
impact. 

"These are soldiers, the same as you," Aedion went on. "Don't let the 
pointy ears deceive you. They bleed like the rest of us. And can die from 
the same wounds, too." 

He didn't let himself glance behind--to where his father commanded 
and shielded another line of ships. Gavriel had kept quiet while Fenrys 
divulged how to keep a quick-healing Fae warrior down: go for slicing 
through muscles rather than stabbing wounds. Snap a tendon and you'll halt 
an immortal long enough to kill. 

Easier said than done. The soldiers had gone pale-faced at the thought 
of it--open combat, blade-to-blade, against Fae warriors. Rightly so. 


But Aedion's duty wasn't to remind them of the blunt facts. His duty 
was to make them willing to die, to make this fight seem utterly necessary. 
Fear could break a line faster than any enemy charge. 

Rhoe--his real father--had taught him that. And Aedion had learned it 
during those years in the North. Learned it fighting knee-deep in mud and 
gore with the Bane. 

He wished they flanked him, not unknown soldiers from the Wastes. 

But he would not let his own fear erode his resolve. 

Maeve's second volley rose up, up, up, the arrows soaring faster and 
farther than those from mortal bows. With better aim. 

The invisible shield above them rippled with flickers of blue and purple 
as arrows hissed and slid off it. 

Buckling already, because those arrows came tipped with magic. 

The soldiers on the deck stirred, shields shifting, their anticipation and 
rising terror coating Aedion's senses. "Just a bit of rain, boys," he said, 
grinning widely. "I thought you bastards were used to it out in the Wastes." 

Some grumbles--but those metal shields stopped shivering. 

Aedion made himself chuckle. Made himself the Wolf of the North, 
eager to spill blood upon the southern seas. As Rhoe had taught him, as 
Rhoe had prepared him, long before Terrasen fell to the shadow of Adarlan. 

Not again. Never again--and certainly not to Maeve. Certainly not here, 
with no one to witness it. 

Ahead, at the front lines, Rowan's magic flared white in silent signal. 

"Arrows at the ready," Aedion ordered. 

Bows groaned, arrows pointing skyward. 

Another flash. 

"Volley!" Aedion bellowed. 

The world darkened beneath their arrows as they sailed toward Maeve's 
armada. 

A storm of arrows--to distract from the real attack beneath the waves. 


The water was dimmer here, the sunlight slim shafts that slid between the 
fat-bellied boats amassed above the waves. 


Other creatures had gathered at the ruckus, flesh-shredders looking for 
the meals that would surely come when the two armadas at last met. 

A flash of light had sent Lysandra diving deep, weaving between the 
circling scavengers, blending into their masses as best as she could while 
she launched into a sprint. 

She had modified her sea dragon. Given it longer limbs--with 
prehensile thumbs. 

Given her tail more strength, more control. 

Her own little project, during the long days of travel. To take one 
original form and perfect it. To alter what the gods had made to her own 
liking. 

Lysandra reached the first ship Rowan had marked. A careful, precise 
map of where and how to strike. A snap of her tail had the rudder in pieces. 

Their shouts reached her even under the waves, but Lysandra was 
already flying, soaring for the next marked boat. 

She used her claws this time, grabbing the rudder and ripping it clean 
off. Then bashing a hole in the keel with her clubbed tail. Clubbed, not 
spiked--no, the spikes had gotten stuck in Skull's Bay. So she'd made her 
tail into a battering ram. 

Arrows fired with better accuracy than the Valg foot soldiers, shooting 
like those rays of sunshine into the water. She'd prepared for that, too. 

They bounced off scales of Spidersilk. Hours spent studying the 
material grafted onto Abraxos's wings had taught her about it--how to 
change her own skin into the impenetrable fiber. 

Lysandra tore into another rudder, then another. And another. 

Fae soldiers were screaming in advance of her. But the harpoons they 
fired were too heavy, and she was too fast, dove too deep and too swift. 
Whips of water magic speared for her, trying to ensnare her. She outswam 
them, too. 

The court that could change the world, she told herself over and over, as 
exhaustion weighed her down, as she kept disabling rudder after rudder, 
punching holes in those selected Fae ships. 

She had made a promise to that court, that future. To Aedion. And to her 
queen. She would not fail her. 

And if gods-damned Maeve wanted to go head-to-head with them, if 
Maeve thought to strike them when they were weakest ... Lysandra was 


going to make the bitch regret it. 


Dorian's magic roiled as Maeve's armada went from firing arrows to 
outright chaos. But he kept his shields intact, patching the spots where 
arrows had broken through. Already, his power wobbled, too swiftly 
drained. 

Either through some trick of Maeve's or whatever magic coated those 
arrows. 

But Dorian gritted his teeth, leashing his magic to his will, Rowan's 
bellowed warnings to hold echoing off the water--amplified in the way that 
Gavriel had used his voice in Skull's Bay. 

But even with the chaos of Maeve's armada finding their ships under 
siege from beneath the water, the lines of it stretched away forever. 

Aelin and Manon had not returned. 

A Fae male in a raging, lethal panic was a terrifying thing to behold. 
Two of them were near cataclysmic. 

When Aelin and Manon had vanished into that mirror, Dorian suspected 
it was only Aedion's roaring that had made Rowan snap out of the blood 
fury he'd descended into. And only the throbbing bruise on Dorian's cheek 
that made Rowan refrain from giving him a matching one. 

Dorian glanced toward the front lines, where the Fae Prince stood at the 
prow of his ship, his sword and hatchet out, a quiver of arrows and bow 
strapped across his back, various hunting knives honed razor-sharp. The 
prince had not snapped out of it at all, he realized. 

No, Rowan had already descended to a level of icy wrath that had 
Dorian's magic trembling, even from the distance now between them. 

He could feel it, Rowan's power--feel it as he'd sensed Aelin's surging 
up. 

Rowan had already been deep within his reservoir of power when Aelin 
and Manon had left. He'd used the last hour, once Aedion had focused that 
fear and anger on the battle ahead, to plunge even deeper. It now flowed 
around them like the sea mere feet below. 

Dorian had followed suit, falling back on the training the prince had 
instilled in him. Ice coated his veins, his heart. 


Aedion had said only one thing to him before departing for his own 
section of the armada. The general-prince had looked him over once, his 
Ashryver eyes lingering on the bruise he'd given him, and said, "Fear is a 
death sentence. When you're out there, remember that we don't need to 
survive. Only put enough of a dent in them so that when she comes back ... 
she'll wipe out the rest." 

When. Not if. But when Aelin found their bodies, or whatever was left 
of them if the sea didn't claim them ... she might very well end the world 
for rage. 

Maybe she should. Maybe this world deserved it. 

Maybe Manon Blackbeak would help her do it. Maybe they'd rule over 
the ruins together. 

He wished he'd had more time to talk to the witch. To get to know her 
beyond what his body had already learned. 

Because even with the rudders being disabled ... ships now advanced. 

Fae warriors. Born and bred to kill. 

Aedion and Rowan sent another volley of arrows aiming for the ships. 
Shields disintegrated them before they could meet any targets. This would 
not end well. 

His heart thundered, and he swallowed as the ships crept around their 
foundering brethren, inching toward that demarcation line. 

His magic writhed. 

He'd have to be careful where to aim. Have to make it count. 

He did not trust his power to remain focused if he unleashed it all. 

And Rowan had told him not to. Had told him to wait until the armada 
was truly upon them. Until they crossed that line. Until the Fae Prince gave 
the order to fire. 

For it was fire--and ice--that warred in Dorian now, begging for 
release. 

He kept his chin high as more ships inched toward those disabled at the 
front, then slipped alongside them. 

Dorian knew it would hurt. Knew it would hurt to wreck his magic, and 
then wreck his body. Knew it would hurt to see his companions go down, 
one by one. 

Still Rowan held the front line, did not let his ships turn to flee. 


Closer and closer, those enemy ships speared toward their front lines, 
hauled by waving limbs of mighty oars. Archers were poised to fire, and 
sunlight glinted off the burnished armor of the battle-hungry Fae warriors 
aboard. Ready and rested, primed to slaughter. 

There would be no surrender. Maeve would destroy them just to punish 
Aelin. 

He'd failed them--in sending Manon and Aelin away. On that gamble, 
he'd perhaps failed all of them. 

But Rowan Whitethorn had not. 

No, as those enemy ships slid into place among their foundering 
companions, Dorian saw that they each bore the same flag: 

A silver banner, with a screaming hawk. 

And where Maeve's black flag of a perching owl had once flapped 
beside it ... now that black flag lowered. 

Now the dark queen's flag vanished entirely, as Fae ships bearing the 
silver banner of the House of Whitethorn opened fire upon their own 
armada. 


Chapter 61


Rowan had told Enda about Aelin. 

He had told his cousin about the woman he loved, the queen whose 
heart burned with wildfire. He had told Enda about Erawan, and the threat 
of the keys, and Maeve's own desire for them. 

And then he had gotten on his knees and begged his cousin to help. 

To not open fire on Terrasen's armada. 

But on Maeve's. 

To not squander this one chance at peace. At halting the darkness before 
it consumed them all, both from Morath and Maeve. To fight not for the 
queen who had enslaved him, but the one who had saved him. 

I will consider it, Endymion had said. 

And so Rowan had gotten off his knees and flown to another cousin's 
ship. Princess Sellene, his youngest, cunning-eyed cousin, had listened. Had 
let him beg. And with a small smile, she had said the same thing. Z will 
consider it. 

So he'd gone, ship to ship. To the cousins he knew might listen. 

An act of treason--that was what he had begged them for. Treason and 
betrayal so great they could never go home. Their lands, their titles, would 
be seized or destroyed. 

And as their unharmed ships sailed into place beside those Lysandra had 
already disabled, as they opened an assault of arrows and magic upon their 
unsuspecting forces, Rowan roared at his own fleet, "Now, now, now!" 

Oars splashed into the waves, men grunting as they rowed like hell for 
the armada in utter chaos. 

Every single one of his cousins had attacked. 

Every single one. As if they had all met, all decided to risk ruination 
together. 


Rowan had not possessed an army of his own to give to Aelin. To give 
to Terrasen. 

So he had won an army for her. Through the only things Aelin had 
claimed were all she wanted from him. 

His heart. His loyalty. His friendship. 

And Rowan wished his Fireheart were there to see it as the House of 
Whitethorn slammed into Maeve's fleet, and ice and wind exploded across 
the waves. 


Lorcan didn't believe it. 

He didn't believe what he was seeing as a third of Maeve's fleet opened 
fire upon the stunned majority of her ships. 

And he knew--he knew without having it confirmed that the banners 
flying on those ships would be silver. 

However he'd convinced them, whenever he'd convinced them ... 

Whitethorn had done it. For her. 

All of it, for Aelin. 

Rowan bellowed the order to press their advantage, to break Maeve's 
armada between them. 

Lorcan, a bit dazed, passed on the order to his own ships. 

Maeve wouldn't allow it. She'd wipe the Whitethorn line off the map 
for this. 

But there they were, unleashing their ice and wind upon their own ships, 
accented with arrows and harpoons that speared through wood and soldiers. 

Wind whipped at his hair, and he knew Whitethorn was now pushing his 
magic to the breaking point to haul their own ships into the fray before his 
cousins lost the advantage of surprise. Fools, all of them. 

Fools, and yet ... 

Gavriel's son was bellowing Whitethorn's name. A gods-damned 
victory cry. Over and over, the men taking up the call. 

Then Fenrys's voice lifted. And Gavriel's. And that red-haired queen. 
The Havilliard king. 

Their armada soared for Maeve's, sun and sea and sails all around, 
blades glinting in the morning brightness. Even the rise and fall of the oars 


seemed to echo the chant. 

On into battle, on into bloodshed, they called the prince's name. 

For a heartbeat, Lorcan allowed himself to ponder it--the power of the 
thing that had compelled Rowan to risk it all. And Lorcan wondered if it 
would perhaps be the one force that Maeve, that Erawan, would not see 
coming. 

But Maeve--Maeve was in that armada somewhere. 

She would retaliate. She would strike back, make them all suffer-- 

Rowan slammed their armada into Maeve's front lines, unleashing the 
fury of his ice and wind alongside their arrows. 

And where Rowan's power paused, Dorian's magic leaped out. 

Not a chance in hell of winning had now become a fool's chance. If 
Whitethorn and the others could hold their lines, keep themselves steady. 

Lorcan found himself scanning for Fenrys and Gavriel across ship and 
soldier. 

And he knew Maeve's answer had come when he spied them, one after 
the other, go rigid. Spied Fenrys take a running leap and vanish into thin air. 
The White Wolf of Doranelle instantly appeared at Gavriel's side, men 
shouting at his appearance out of a pocket of nothing. 

But he gripped Gavriel's arm, and then they were both gone again, their 
faces taut. Only Gavriel managed to look toward Lorcan before they 
vanished--his eyes wide in warning. Gavriel pointed, then they were 
nothing but sunlight and spindrift. 

Lorcan stared at where Gavriel had managed to point, that bit of 
defiance that had likely cut deep. 

Lorcan's blood went cold. 

Maeve was allowing the battle to explode across the water because she 
had other games afoot. Because she was not on the seas at all. 

But on the shore. 

Gavriel had pointed to it. Not to the distant beach, but up the shore-- 
westward. 

Precisely where he had left Elide hours ago. 

And Lorcan did not care about the battle, about what he'd agreed to do 
for Whitethorn, the promise he'd made the prince. 

He had made a promise to her first. 


The soldiers weren't stupid enough to try to stop him as Lorcan ordered 
one of them in charge, and seized a longboat. 


Elide couldn't view the battle from where she waited among the sand 
dunes, the seagrasses hissing around her. But she could hear it, the shouting 
and the booming. 

She tried not to listen to the din of battle, tried to instead beg Anneith to 
give her friends guidance. To keep Lorcan alive, and Maeve far from him. 

But Anneith was sticking close, hovering behind her shoulder. 

See, she said, as she always did. See, see, see. 

There was nothing but sand and grass and water and blue sky. Nothing 
but the eight guards Lorcan had commanded to stay with her, lounging on 
the dunes, looking either relieved or put-out to miss the battle raging on the 
waves around the bend in the coast. 

The voice became urgent. See, see, see. 

Then Anneith vanished entirely. No--/led. 

Clouds gathered, sweeping from the marshes. Heading toward the sun 
beginning its ascent. 

Elide got to her feet, sliding a bit on the steep dune. 

The wind whipped and hissed through the grasses--and warm sand 
turned gray and muted as those clouds passed over the sun. Blotting it out. 

Something was coming. 

Something that knew Aelin Galathynius drew strength from sunlight. 
From Mala. 

Elide's mouth dried. If Vernon found her here ... there would be no 
escaping him now. 

The guards on the dunes behind her stirred, noticing the strange wind, 
the clouds. Sensing that approaching storm was not of natural origin. Would 
they stand against the ilken long enough for help to come? Or would 
Vernon bring more of them this time? 

But it was not Vernon who appeared on the beach, as if walking out of a 
passing breeze. 

Chapter 62


It was an agony. 

An agony, to see Nehemia, young and strong and wise. Speaking to 
Elena in the marshes, among those same ruins. 

And then there was the other agony. 

That Elena and Nehemia had known each other. Worked together. 

That Elena had laid these plans a thousand years ago. 

That Nehemia had gone to Rifthold knowing she'd die. 

Knowing she'd need to break Aelin--use her death to break her, so she 
could walk away from the assassin and ascend her throne. 

Aelin and Manon were shown another scene. Of a whispered 
conversation at midnight, deep beneath the glass castle. 

A queen and a princess, meeting in secret. As they had for months. 

The queen asking the princess to pay that price she'd offered back in the 
marshes. To arrange for her own death--to set this all in motion. Nehemia 
had warned Elena that she--that Aelin--would be broken. Worse, that she 
would go so far into an abyss of rage and despair that she wouldn't be able 
to get out. Not as Celaena. 

Nehemia had been right. 

Aelin was shaking--shaking in her half-invisible body, shaking so 
badly she thought her skin would ripple off her bones. Manon stepped 
closer, perhaps the only comfort the witch knew how to offer: solidarity. 

They stared into the swirling mist again, where the scenes--the 
memories--had unfolded. 

Aelin wasn't sure she could stomach another truth. Another revelation 
of just how thoroughly Elena had sold her and Dorian to the gods, for the 
fool's mistake she'd made, not understanding the Lock's true purpose, to 
seal Erawan in his tomb rather than let Brannon finally end it--and send the 
gods to wherever they called home, dragging Erawan with them. 


Send them home ... using the keys to open the Wyrdgate. And a new 
Lock to seal it forever. 

Nameless is my price. 

Using her power, drained to the last drop, her life to forge that new 
Lock. To wield the power of the keys only once--just once, to banish them 
all, and then seal the gate forever. 

Memories flickered by. 

Elena and Brannon, screaming at each other in a room Aelin had not 
seen for ten years--the king's suite in the palace at Orynth. Her suite--or it 
would have been. A necklace glittered at Elena's throat: the Eye. The first 
and now-broken Lock, that Elena, now the Queen of Adarlan, seemed to 
wear as some sort of reminder of her foolishness, her promise to those 
furious gods. 

Her argument with her father raged and raged--until the princess 
walked out. And Aelin knew Elena had never returned to that shining 
palace in the North. 

Then the reveal of that witch mirror in some nondescript stone chamber, 
a black-haired beauty with a crown of stars standing before Elena and 
Gavin, explaining how the witch mirror worked--how it would contain 
these memories. Rhiannon Crochan. Manon started at the sight of her, and 
Aelin glanced between them. 

The face ... it was the same. Manon's face, and Rhiannon Crochan's. 
The last Crochan Queens--of two separate eras. 

Then an image of Brannon alone--head in his hands, weeping before a 
shrouded body atop a stone altar. A crone's bent shape lay beneath. 

Elena, her immortal grace yielded in order to live out a human life span 
with Gavin. Brannon still looked no older than thirty. 

Brannon, the heat of a thousand forges shining on his red-gold hair, his 
teeth bared in a snarl as he pounded a metal disk on an anvil, the muscles of 
his back rippling beneath golden skin as he struck and struck and struck. 

As he forged the Amulet of Orynth. 

As he placed a sliver of black stone within either side, then sealed it, 
defiance written in every line of his body. 

Then wrote the message in Wyrdmarks on the back. 

One message. 

For her. 


For his true heir, should Elena's punishment and promise to the gods 
hold true. The punishment and promise that had cleaved them. That 
Brannon could not and would not accept. Not while he had strength left. 

Nameless is my price. Written right there--in Wyrdmarks. The one who 
bore Brannon's mark, the mark of the bastard-born nameless ... She would 
be the cost to end this. 

The message on the back of the Amulet of Orynth was the only warning 
he could offer, the only apology for what his daughter had done, even as it 
contained a secret inside so deadly no one must know, no one could ever be 
told. 

But there would be clues. For her. To finish what they'd started. 

Brannon built Elena's tomb with his own hands. Carved the messages in 
there for Aelin, too. 

The riddles and the clues. The best he could offer to explain the truth 
while keeping those keys hidden from the world, from powers who would 
use them to rule, to destroy. 

Then he made Mort, the metal for the door knocker gifted by Rhiannon 
Crochan, who brushed a hand over the king's cheek before she left the 
tomb. 

Rhiannon was not present when Brannon hid the sliver of black stone 
beneath the jewel in Elena's crown--the second Wyrdkey. 

Or when he set Damaris in its stand, near the second sarcophagus. For 
the mortal king he hated and had barely tolerated, but he had leashed that 
loathing for his daughter's sake. Even if Gavin had taken his daughter, the 
daughter of his soul, away from him. 

The final key ... he went to Mala's temple. 

It was where he had wanted to end this all along anyway. 

The molten fire around the temple was a song in his blood, a beckoning. 
A welcoming. 

Only those with his gifts--her gifts--could get there. Even the 
priestesses could not reach the island in the heart of the molten river. Only 
his heir would be able to do that. Or whoever held another key. 

So he set the remaining key under a flagstone. 

And then he walked into that molten river, into the burning heart of his 
beloved. 

And Brannon, King of Terrasen, Lord of Fire, did not emerge again. 


Aelin didn't know why it surprised her to be able to cry in this body. 
That this body had tears to spill. 

But Aelin shed them for Brannon. Who knew what Elena had promised 
the gods--and had raged against it, the passing of this burden onto one of 
his descendants. 

Brannon had done what he could for her. To soften the blow of that 
promise, if he could not change its course wholly. To give Aelin a fighting 
chance. 

Nameless is my price. 

"I don't understand what this means," Manon said quietly. 

Aelin did not have the words to tell her. She had not been able to tell 
Rowan. 

But then Elena appeared, real as they were real, and stared into the 
fading golden light of Mala's temple as the memory vanished. "I'm sorry," 
she said to Aelin. 

Manon stiffened at Elena's approach, taking a step from Aelin's side. 

"It was the only way," Elena offered. That was genuine pain in her eyes. 
Regret. 

"Was it a choice, or just to spare Gavin's precious bloodline, that I was 
the one who was selected?" The voice that came from Aelin's throat was 
raw, vicious. "Why spill Havilliard blood, after all, when you could fall 
back on old habits and choose another to bear the burden?" 

Elena flinched. "Dorian was not ready. You were. The choice Nehemia 
and I made was to ensure that things went according to plan." 

"According to plan," Aelin breathed. "According to all your schemes to 
make me clean up the mess of what you started with your gods-damned 
thieving and cowardice?" 

"They wanted me to suffer,' Elena said. "And I have. Knowing you 
must do this, bear this burden ... It has been a steady, endless shredding of 
my soul for a thousand years. It was so easy to say yes, to imagine you 
would be a stranger, someone who would not need to know the truth, only 
to be in the right place with the right gift, and yet ... and yet I was wrong. I 
was so wrong." Elena lifted her hands before her, palms up. "I thought 
Erawan would rise, and the world would face him. I did not know ... I did 
not know darkness would fall. I did not know that your land would suffer. 
Suffer as I tried to keep mine from suffering. And there were so many 


voices ... SO many voices even before Adarlan conquered. It was those 
voices that woke me. The voices of those wishing for an answer, for help." 
Elena's eyes slid to Manon, then back to hers. "They were from all 
kingdoms, all races. Human, witch-kind, Fae ... But they wove a tapestry of 
dreams, all begging for that one thing ... A better world. 

"Then you were born. And you were an answer to the gathering 
darkness, with that flame. My father's flame, my mother's might--reborn at 
last. And you were strong, Aelin. So strong, and so vulnerable. Not to 
outside threats, but the threat of your own heart, the isolation of your power. 
But there were those who knew you for what you were, what you could 
offer. Your parents, their court, your great-uncle ... and Aedion. Aedion 
knew you were the Queen Who Was Promised without knowing what it 
meant, without knowing anything about you, or me, or what I did to spare 
my own people." 

The words hit her like stones. "The Queen Who Was Promised," Aelin 
said. "But not to the world. To the gods--to the keys." 

To pay the price. To be their sacrifice in order to seal the keys in the 
gate at last. 

Deanna's appearance hadn't been only to tell her how to use the mirror, 
but to remind her that she belonged to them. Had a debt owed to them. 

Aelin said too quietly, "I didn't survive that night in the Florine River 
because of pure luck, did I?" 

Elena shook her head. "We did not--" 

"No," Aelin snapped. "Show me." 

Elena's throat bobbed. But then the mists turned dark and colored, and 
the very air around them became laced with frost. 

Breaking branches, ragged breath punctuated with gasping sobs, light 
footsteps crashing through bramble and brush. A horse's thunderous gait, 
closing in-- 

Aelin made herself stand still when that familiar, frozen wood appeared, 
exactly as she remembered it. As she appeared, so small and young, white 
nightgown torn and muddy, hair wild, eyes bright with terror and grief so 
profound it had broken her entirely. Frantic to reach the roaring river 
beyond, the bridge-- 

There were the posts, and the forest on the other side. Her sanctuary-- 


Manon swore softly as Aelin Galathynius flung herself through the 
bridge posts, realized the bridge had been cut ... and plummeted into the 
raging, half-frozen river below. 

She had forgotten how far that fall was. How violent the black river 
was, the white rapids illuminated by the icy moon overhead. 

The image shifted, and then it was dark, and silent, and they were being 
tumbled, over and over as the river tossed her in its wrath. 

"There was so much death," Elena whispered as they watched Aelin 
being thrown and twisted and dragged down by the river. The cold was 
crushing. 

"So much death, and so many lights extinguished," Elena said, voice 
breaking. "You were so small. And you fought ... you fought so hard." 

And there she was, clawing at the water, kicking and thrashing, trying to 
get to the surface, to the air, and she could feel her lungs begin to seize, feel 
the pressure building-- 

Then light flickered from the Amulet of Orynth hanging around her 
neck, greenish symbols fizzing like bubbles around her. 

Elena slid to her knees, watching that amulet glow beneath the water. 
"They wanted me to take you, right then. You had the Amulet of Orynth, 
everyone thought you were dead, and the enemy was distracted with the 
slaughter. I could take you, help you track down the other two keys. I was 
allowed to help you--to do that much. And once we got the other two, I 
was to force you to forge the Lock anew. To use every last drop of you to 
make that Lock, summon the gate, put the keys back into it, send them 
home, and end it all. You had enough power, even then. It'd kill you to do 
it, but you were likely dead anyway. So they let me form a body, to get 
you." 

Elena took a shuddering breath as a figure plunged into the water. A 
silver-haired, beautiful woman in an ancient dress. She grabbed Aelin 
around the waist, hauling her up, up, up. 

They hit the surface of the river, and it was dark and loud and wild, and 
it was all she could do to grab the log Elena shoved her onto, to dig her 
nails into the soaked wood and cling to it while she was carried downriver, 
deep into the night. 

"I hesitated," Elena breathed. "You clung to that log with all your 
strength. Everything had been taken from you--everything--and yet you 


still fought. You did not yield. And they told me to hurry, because even then 
their power to hold me in that solid body was fading. They said to just take 
you and go, but ... I hesitated. I waited until you got to that riverbank." 

Mud and reeds and trees looming overhead, snow still patching the 
steep hill of the bank. 

Aelin watched herself crawl up that riverbank, inch by painful inch, and 
she felt the phantom, icy mud beneath her nails, felt her broken, frozen 
body as it slumped onto the earth and shuddered, over and over. 

As lethal cold gripped her while Elena hauled herself onto the bank 
beside her. 

As Elena lunged for her, screaming her name, cold and shock setting in 


"I thought the danger would be drowning," Elena whispered. "I didn't 
realize being out in the cold for so long ..." 

Her lips had gone blue. Aelin watched her own small chest rise, fall, 
rise ... 

Then stop moving all together. 

"You died," Elena whispered. "Right there, you died. You had fought so 
hard, and I failed you. And in that moment, I didn't care that Pd again 
failed the gods, or my promise to make it right, or any of it. All I could 
think ..." Tears ran down Elena's face. "All I could think was how unfair it 
was. You had not even lived, you had not even been given a chance ... And 
all those people, who had wished and waited for a better world ... You 
would not be there to give it to them." 

Oh gods. 

"Elena," Aelin breathed. 

The Queen of Adarlan sobbed into her hands, even as her former self 
shook Aelin, over and over. Trying to wake her, trying to revive the small 
body that had given out. 

Elena's voice broke. "I could not allow it. I could not endure it. Not for 
the gods' sake, but--but for your own." 

Light flared at Elena's hand, then down her arm, then along her whole 
body. Fire. She wrapped herself around Aelin, the heat melting the snow 
around them, drying her ice-crusted hair. 

Lips that were blue turned pink. And a chest that had stopped breathing 
now lifted. 


Darkness faded to the gray light of dawn. "And then I defied them." 

Elena set her down between the reeds and rose, scanning the river, the 
world. 

"I knew who had an estate near this river, so far away from your home 
that your parents had tolerated its presence, as long as he was not stupid 
enough to stir up trouble." 

Elena, a mere flicker of light, tugged Arobynn from a deep sleep inside 
his former residence in Terrasen. As if in a trance, he shoved on his boots, 
his red hair gleaming in the light of dawn, mounted his horse, and set off 
into the woods. 

So young, her former master. Only a few years older than she was now. 

Arobynn's horse paused as if an invisible hand had yanked its bridle, 
and the assassin scanned the raging river, the trees, as if looking for 
something he didn't even know was there. 

But there was Elena, invisible as sunlight, crouching in the reeds when 
Arobynn's eyes fell upon the small, dirty figure unconscious on the 
riverbank. He leaped from his horse with feline grace, slinging off his cloak 
as he threw himself to his knees in the mud and felt for her breathing. 

"I knew what he was, what he'd likely do with you. What training you 
would receive. But it was better than dead. And if you could survive, if you 
could grow up strong, if you had the chance to reach adulthood, I thought 
perhaps you could give those people who had wished and dreamed of a 
better world ... at least give them a chance. Help them--before the debt 
was called in again." 

Arobynn's hands hesitated as he noticed the Amulet of Orynth. 

He eased the amulet from around her neck and placed it in his pocket. 
Gently, he scooped her into his arms and carried her up the bank to his 
waiting horse. 

"You were so young," Elena said again. "And more than the dreamers, 
more than the debt ... I wanted to give you time. To at least know what it 
was to live." 

Aelin rasped, "What was the price, Elena? What did they do to you for 
this?" 

Elena wrapped her arms around herself as the image faded, Arobynn 
mounting his horse, Aelin in his arms. Mist swirled again. "When it is 
done," Elena managed to say, "I go, too. For the time I bought you, when 


this game is finished, my soul will be melted back into the darkness. I will 
not see Gavin, or my children, or my friends ... I will be gone. Forever." 

"Did you know that before you--" 

"Yes. They told me, over and over. But ... I couldn't. I couldn't do it." 

Aelin slid to her knees before the queen. Took Elena's tearstained face 
between her hands. 

"Nameless is my price," Aelin said, her voice breaking. 

Elena nodded. "The mirror was just that--a mirror. A ploy to get you 
here. So that you could understand everything we did." Just a bit of metal 
and glass, Elena had said when Aelin had summoned her in Skull's Bay. 
"But now you are here, and have seen. Now you comprehend the cost. To 
forge the Lock anew, to put the three keys back in the gate ..." 

A mark glowed on Aelin's brow, heating her skin. The bastard mark of 
Brannon. 

The mark of the nameless. 

"Mala's blood must be spent--your power must be spent. Every drop, 
of magic, of blood. You are the cost--to make a new Lock, and seal the 
keys into the gate. To make the Wyrdgate whole." 

Aelin said softly, "I know." She had known for some time now. 

Had been preparing for it as best she could. Preparing things for the 
others. 

Aelin said to the queen, "I have two keys. If I can find the third, steal it 
from Erawan ... will you come with me? Help me end it once and for all?" 

Will you come with me, so I will not be alone? 

Elena nodded, but whispered, "I'm sorry." 

Aelin lowered her hands from the queen's face. Took a deep, shuddering 
breath. "Why didn't you tell me--from the start?" 

Behind them, she had the vague sense that Manon was quietly 
assessing. 

"You were barely climbing out of slavery," Elena said. "Hardly holding 
yourself together, trying so hard to pretend that you were still strong and 
whole. There was only so much I could do to guide you, nudge you along. 
The mirror was forged and hidden to one day show you all of this. In a way 
I couldn't tell you--not when I could only manage a few minutes at a 
time." 


"Why did you tell me to go to Wendlyn? Maeve poses as great a threat 
as Erawan." 

Glacier-blue eyes met hers at last. "I know. Maeve has long wished to 
regain possession of the keys. My father believed it was for something other 
than conquest. Something darker, worse. I don't know why she only began 
hunting for them once you arrived. But I sent you to Wendlyn for the 
healing. And so you would ... find him. The one who had been waiting so 
long for you." 

Aelin's heart cracked. "Rowan." 

Elena nodded. "He was a voice in the void, a secret, silent dreamer. And 
so were his companions. But the Fae Prince, he was ..." 

Aelin reined in her sob. "I know. I've known for a long time." 

"I wanted you to know that joy, too," Elena whispered. "However 
briefly." 

"I did," Aelin managed to say. "Thank you." 

Elena covered her face at those words, shuddering. But after a moment, 
she surveyed Aelin, then Manon, still silent and watching. "The witch 
mirror's power is fading; it will not hold you here for much longer. Please 
--let me show you what must be done. How to end it. You won't be able to 
see me after, but ... I will be with you. Until the very end, every step of the 
way, I will be with you." 

Manon only put a hand on her sword as Aelin swallowed and said, 
"Show me, then." 

So Elena did. And when she was done, Aelin was silent. Manon was 
pacing, snarling softly. 

But Aelin did not fight it as Elena leaned in to kiss her brow, where that 
damning mark had been her whole life. A bit of chattel, branded for the 
slaughterhouse. 

Brannon's mark. The mark of the bastard-born ... the Nameless. 

Nameless is my price. To buy them a future, she'd pay it. 

She'd done as much as she could to set things in motion to ensure that 
once she was gone, help would still come. It was the only thing she could 
give them, her last gift to Terrasen. To those she loved with her heart of 
wildfire. 

Elena stroked her cheek. Then the ancient queen and the mists were 
gone. 


Sunlight flooded them, blinding Aelin and Manon so violently that they 
hissed and slammed into each other. The brine of the sea, crash of nearby 
waves, and rustle of seagrasses greeted them. And beyond that, distantly: 
the clamor and bellowing of all-out war. 

They were on the outskirts of the marshes, upon the lip of the sea itself, 
the battle miles and miles out to sea. They must have traveled within the 
mists, somehow-- 

A soft female laugh slithered through the grass. Aelin knew that laugh. 

And knew that somehow, perhaps they had not traveled through the 
mists ... 

But they had been placed here. By whatever forces were at work, 
whatever gods watching. 

To stand in the sandy field before the turquoise sea, dead guards in 
Briarcliff armor slaughtered upon the nearby dunes, still bleeding out. To 
stand before Queen Maeve of the Fae. 

Elide Lochan on her knees before her--with a Fae warrior's blade at her 
throat. 


Chapter 63


Aedion had faced armies, faced death more times than he could count, but 
this ... 

Even with what Rowan had done ... the enemy ships still outnumbered 
them. 

The battling between ships had become too dangerous, the magic- 
wielders too aware of Lysandra to allow her to attack beneath the waves. 

She was now fighting viciously beside Aedion in ghost leopard form, 
taking down whatever Fae warriors tried to board their ship. Whatever 
soldiers made it through the shredding gauntlet of Rowan's and Dorian's 
magic. 

His father had left. Fenrys and Lorcan, too. He'd last seen his father on 
the quarterdeck of one of the ships that had been under his command, a 
sword in each hand, the Lion poised for the kill. And as if sensing Aedion's 
gaze, a wall of golden light had wrapped around him. 

Aedion wasn't stupid enough to demand Gavriel take it away, not as the 
shield shrank and shrank, until it covered Aedion like a second skin. 

Minutes later, Gavriel was gone--vanished. But that magic shield 
remained. 

That had been the start of the sharp turn they'd taken, going back on the 
defensive as sheer numbers and immortal-versus-mortal fighting took its 
toll on their fleet. 

He had no doubt Maeve had something to do with it. But that bitch 
wasn't his problem. 

No, his problem was the armada all around him; his problem was the 
fact that the enemy soldiers he engaged were highly trained and didn't go 
down easily. His problem was his sword arm ached, his shield was 
embedded with arrows and dented, and still more of those ships stretched 
away into the distance. 


He did not let himself think about Aelin, about where she was. His Fae 
instincts pricked at the rumble of Rowan's and Dorian's magic surging up, 
then snapping into the enemy flank. Ships broke in the wake of that power; 
warriors drowned beneath the weight of their armor. 

Their own ship rocked back from the one they'd been engaging thanks 
to the flood of power, and Aedion used the reprieve to whirl to Lysandra. 
Blood from his own wounds and ones he'd inflicted covered him, mixing 
with the sweat running down his skin. He said to the shifter, "I want you to 
run." 

Lysandra turned a fuzzy head toward him, pale green eyes narrowing 
slightly. Blood and gore dripped from her maw onto the wood planks. 

Aedion held that gaze. "You turn into a bird or a moth or a fish--I don't 
rutting care--and you go. If we're about to fall, you run. That's an order." 

She hissed, as if to say, You don t give me orders. 

"I technically outrank you," he said, slashing his sword down his shield 
to clear it of two protruding arrows as they again swung in toward another 
ship crammed full of well-rested Fae warriors. "So you'll run. Or PI kick 
your ass in the Afterworld." 

Lysandra stalked up to him. A lesser man might have backed away from 
a predator that big prowling close. Some of his own soldiers did. 

But Aedion held his ground as she rose on her back legs, those huge 
paws settling on his shoulders, and brought her bloodied feline face up to 
his. Her wet whiskers twitched. 

Lysandra leaned in and nuzzled his cheek, his neck. 

Then she trotted back to her place, blood splashing beneath her silent 
paws. 

When she deigned to glance his way, spitting blood onto the deck, 
Aedion said softly, "The next time, do that in your human form." 

Her puffy tail just curled a bit in answer. 

But their ship rocked back toward their latest attacker. The temperature 
plummeted, either from Rowan or Dorian or one of the Whitethorn nobles, 
Aedion couldn't tell. They'd been lucky that Maeve had brought a fleet 
whose magic-wielders hailed mostly from Rowan's line. 

Aedion braced himself, spreading apart his feet as wind and ice tore into 
the enemy lines. Fae soldiers, perhaps ones Rowan himself had 
commanded, screamed. But Rowan and Dorian struck relentlessly. 


Line after line, Rowan and Dorian blasted their power into Maeve's 
fleet. 

Yet more ships flooded past them, engaging Aedion and the others. 
Ansel of Briarcliff held the left flank, and ... the lines remained steady. 
Even if Maeve's armada still outnumbered them. 

The first Fae soldier who cleared the railing of their ship headed right 
for Lysandra. 

It was the last mistake the male made. 

She leaped, dodging past his guard, and closed her jaws around his 
neck. 

Bone crunched and blood sprayed. 

Aedion leaped forward to engage the next soldier over the railing, 
cutting through the grappling hooks that arced and landed true. 

Aedion loosed himself into a killing calm, an eye on the shifter, who 
took down soldier after soldier, his father's gold shield holding strong 
around her, too. 

Death rained upon him. 

Aedion did not let himself think about how many were left. How many 
Rowan and Dorian felled, the ruins of ships sinking around them, blood and 
flotsam choking the sea. 

So Aedion kept killing. 

And killing. 

And killing. 


Dorian's breath burned his throat, his magic was sluggish, a headache 
pulsed at his temples, but he kept unleashing his power upon the enemy 
lines while soldiers fought and died around him. 

So many. So many trained warriors, a scant few of whom were blessed 
with magic--and had been wielding it to get past them. 

He didn't dare see how the others were faring. All he heard were roars 
and snarls of wrath, shrieks of dying people, and the crack of wood and the 
snap of rope. Clouds had formed and gathered above, blocking out the sun. 

His magic sang as it froze the life out of ships, out of soldiers, as it 
bathed in their death. But it still flagged. He'd lost track of how long it had 





been. 

Still, they kept coming. And still, Manon and Aelin did not return. 

Rowan held the front line, weapons angled, ready for any soldiers stupid 
enough to approach. But too many broke past their magic. Too many now 
steadily overwhelmed them. 

As soon as he thought it, Aedion's bark of pain cut across the waves. 

There was a roar of rage that echoed it. Was Aedion-- 

The coppery tang of blood coated Dorian's mouth--the burnout. 
Another roar, deep and bellowing, cleaved the world. Dorian braced 
himself, rallying his magic perhaps for the last time. 

That roar sounded again as a mighty shape shot down from the heavy 
clouds. 

A wyvern. A wyvern with shimmering wings. 

And behind it, descending upon the Fae fleet with wicked delight, flew 
twelve others. 


Chapter 64


Lysandra knew that roar. 

And then there was Abraxos, plunging from the heavy clouds, twelve 
other wyverns with riders behind him. 

Ironteeth witches. 

"Hold your fire" Rowan bellowed from half a dozen ships away, at the 
archers who had trained their few remaining arrows on the golden-haired 
witch closest to Abraxos, her pale-blue wyvern shrieking a war cry. 

The other witches and their wyverns unleashed hell upon the Fae, 
smashing through the converging lines, snapping grappling ropes, buying 
them a moment's reprieve. How they knew who to attack, what side to fight 
for-- 

Abraxos and eleven others angled northward in one smooth movement, 
then plowed into the panicking enemy fleet. The golden-haired rider, 
however, swept for Lysandra's ship, her sky-blue wyvern gracefully landing 
on the prow. 

The witch was beautiful, a strip of black braided leather across her 
brow, and she called to none of them in particular, "Where is Manon 
Blackbeak?" 

"Who are you?" Aedion demanded, his voice a rasp. But there was 
recognition in his eyes, as if remembering that day at Temis's temple-- 

The witch grinned, revealing white teeth, but iron glinted at her 
fingertips. ""Asterin Blackbeak, at your service." She scanned the embattled 
ships. "Where is Manon? Abraxos led--" 

"It's a long story, but she's here,' Aedion shouted over the din. 
Lysandra crept closer, sizing up the witch, the coven that was now wreaking 
havoc upon the Fae lines. "You and your Thirteen save our asses, witch," 
Aedion said, "and I' Il tell you anything you damn want." 


A wicked grin and an incline of her head. "Then we shall clear the field 
for you." 

Then Asterin and the wyvern soared up, and blasted between the waves, 
spearing for where the others were fighting. 

At Asterin's approach, the wyverns and riders reeled back, rising high 
into the air, falling into formation. A hammer about to strike. 

The Fae knew it. They began throwing up feeble shields, shooting 
wildly for them, their panic making their aim sloppy. But the wyverns were 
covered in armor--efficient, beautiful armor. 

The Thirteen laughed at their enemy as they slammed into its southern 
flank. 

Lysandra wished she had strength left to shift--one last time. To join 
them in that glorious destruction. 

The Thirteen herded the panicking ships between them, smashed them 
apart, wielding every weapon in their arsenal--wyverns, blades, iron teeth. 
What got past them received the brutal mercy of Rowan's and Dorian's 
magic. And what got past that magic ... 

Lysandra found Aedion's blood-splattered stare. The general-prince 
smirked in that insolent way of his, sending a thrill wilder than bloodlust 
through her. "We don't want the witches to make us look bad, do we?" 

Lysandra returned his smirk and lunged back into the fray. 


Not many more. 

Rowan's magic was strained to the breaking point, his panic a dull 
roaring in the back of his mind, but he kept attacking, kept swinging his 
blades at any that got past his wind and ice, or Dorian's own blasts of raw, 
unchecked power. Fenrys, Lorcan, and Gavriel had bolted an hour or 
lifetimes ago, vanishing to wherever Maeve had no doubt summoned them, 
but the armada held fast. Whoever Ansel of Briarcliff's men were, they 
weren't cowed by Fae warriors. And they were no strangers to bloodshed. 
Neither were Rolfe's men. None of them ran. 

The Thirteen continued to wreak havoc on Maeve's panicking fleet. 
Asterin Blackbeak barked commands high above them, the twelve witches 


breaking the enemy lines with fierce, clever determination. If this was how 
one coven fought, then an army of them-- 

Rowan gritted his teeth as the remaining ships decided to be smarter 
than their dead companions and began to peel away. If Maeve gave the 
order to retreat-- 

Too bad. Too damn bad. He'd send her own ship down to the inky black 
himself. 

He gave Asterin a sharp whistle the next time she passed overhead, 
rallying her Thirteen again. She whistled back in confirmation. The 
Thirteen launched after the fleeing armada. 

The battle ebbed, red waves laden with debris flowing past on the swift 
tide. 

Rowan gave the order to the captain to hold the lines and deal with any 
stupidity from Maeve's armada if any ships decided not to turn tail. 

His legs trembling, his arms shaking so badly he was afraid that if he let 
go of his weapons he wouldn't be able to pick them up again, Rowan 
shifted and soared high. 

His cousins had joined the Thirteen in their pursuit of the fleet now 
trying to run. He avoided the urge to count. But--Rowan flew higher, 
scanning. 

There was one boat missing. 

A boat he'd sailed on, worked on, fought on in past wars and journeys. 

Maeve's personal battleship, the Nightingale, was nowhere to be seen. 

Not within the retreating fleet now fending off the Whitethorn royals 
and the Thirteen. 

Not within the sinking hulks of ships now bleeding out in the water. 

Rowan's blood chilled. But he dove fast and hard for Aedion and 
Lysandra's ship, where gore covered the deck so thickly it rippled as he 
shifted and set down in it. 

Aedion was covered in blood, both his own and others'; Lysandra was 
purging a stomach full of it. Rowan managed to will his legs into 
maneuvering around fallen Fae. He did not look too closely at their faces. 

"Is she back?" Aedion instantly demanded, wincing as he put weight on 
his thigh. Rowan surveyed his brother's wound. He'd have to heal him soon 
--as soon as his magic replenished. In a place like this, even Aedion's Fae 
blood couldn't keep the infection away long. 


"T don't know," Rowan said. 

"Find her,' Aedion growled. He broke Rowan's stare only to watch 
Lysandra shift into her human form--and ran an eye over the injuries that 
peppered her skin. 

Rowan's skin tightened over his bones. He had the feeling that the 
ground was about to slip from under his feet as Dorian appeared at the rail 
of the main deck, gaunt-faced and haggard, no doubt having used the last of 
his magic to propel a longboat over, and panted, "The coast. Aelin is out by 
the coast where we sent Elide--they all are." 

That was miles away. How the hell had they gotten there? 

"How do you know?" Lysandra demanded, tying back her hair with 
bloody fingers. 

"Because I can feel something out there," Dorian said. "Flame and 
shadow and death. Like Lorcan and Aelin and someone else. Someone 
ancient. Powerful." Rowan braced himself for it, but he still wasn't ready 
for the pure terror when Dorian added, "And female." 

Maeve had found them. 

The battle had not been for any sort of victory or conquest. 

But a distraction. While Maeve slipped away to get the real prize. 

They'd never arrive fast enough. If he flew on his own, his magic 
already drained to the breaking point, he would be of little help. They stood 
a better chance, Aelin stood a better chance, if they were all there. 

Rowan whirled to the horizon behind them--to the wyverns destroying 
the remnants of the fleet. Rowing would take too long; his magic was 
gutted. But a wyvern ... That might do. 


Chapter 65


The Queen of the Fae was exactly as Aelin remembered. Swirling dark 
robes, a beautiful pale face beneath onyx hair, red lips set in a faint smile ... 
No crown adorned her head, for all who breathed, even the dead who 
slumbered, would know her for what she was. 

Dreams and nightmares given form; the dark face of the moon. 

And kneeling before Maeve, a stone-faced sentry holding a blade to her 
bare throat, Elide trembled. Her guards, all men in Ansel's armor, had likely 
been killed before they could shout a warning. From the weapons that were 
only half out of their sheaths, they hadn't even had the chance to fight. 

Manon had gone still as death at the sight of Elide, her iron nails sliding 
free. 

Aelin forced a half smile to her mouth, shoved her raw, bleeding heart 
into a box deep inside her chest. "Not as impressive as Doranelle, if you ask 
me, but at least a swamp really reflects your true nature, you know? It'll be 
a wonderful new home for you. Definitely worth the cost of coming all this 
way to conquer it." 

At the edge of the hill that flowed down to the beach a small party of 
Fae warriors monitored them. Male and female, all armed, all strangers. A 
massive, elegant ship idled in the calm bay beyond. 

Maeve smiled slightly. "What a joy, to learn that your usual good spirits 
remain undimmed in such dark days." 

"How could they not, when so many of your pretty males are in my 
company?" 

Maeve cocked her head, her heavy curtain of dark hair sliding off a 
shoulder. And as if in answer, Lorcan appeared at the edge of the dunes, 
panting, wild-eyed, sword out. His focus--and horror, Aelin realized--on 
Elide. On the sentry holding the blade against her white neck. Maeve gave a 
little smile to the warrior, but looked to Manon. 


With her attention elsewhere, Lorcan took up a place at Aelin's side--as 
if they were somehow allies in this, would fight back-to-back. Aelin didn't 
bother to say anything to him. Not as Maeve said to the witch, "I know your 
face." 

That face remained cold and impassive. "Let the girl go." 

A small, breathy laugh. "Ah." Aelin's stomach clenched as that ancient 
focus shifted to Elide. "Claimed by queen, and witch, and ... my Second, it 
seems." 

Aelin tensed. She didn't think Lorcan was breathing beside her. 

Maeve toyed with a strand of Elide's limp hair. The Lady of Perranth 
shook. "The girl who Lorcan Salvaterre summoned me to save." 

That ripple of Lorcan's power the day Ansel's fleet had closed in ... 
She'd known it was a summoning. The same way she'd summoned the Valg 
to Skull's Bay. She'd refused to immediately explain Ansel's presence, 
wanting to enjoy the surprise of it, and he had summoned Maeve's armada 
to take on what he'd believed to be an enemy fleet. To save Elide. 

Lorcan just said, "I'm sorry." 

Aelin didn't know if it was to her or Elide, whose eyes now widened 
with outrage. But Aelin said, "You think I didn't know? That I didn't take 
precautions?" 

Lorcan's brows furrowed. Aelin shrugged. 

But Maeve went on, "Lady Elide Lochan, daughter of Cal and Marion 
Lochan. No wonder the witch itches to retrieve you, if her bloodline runs in 
your veins." 

Manon snarled a warning. 

Aelin drawled to the Fae Queen, "Well, you didn't drag your ancient 
carcass all the way here for nothing. So let's get on with it. What do you 
want for the girl?" 

That adder's smile curled Maeve's lips again. 


Elide was trembling; every bone, every pore was trembling in terror at the 
immortal queen standing above her, at the guard's blade at her throat. The 
rest of the queen's escort remained distant--but it was to the escort that 


Lorcan kept glancing, his face tight, his own body near-shaking with 
restrained wrath. 

This was the queen to whom he'd given his heart? This cold creature 
who looked at the world with mirthless eyes? Who had killed those soldiers 
without a blink of hesitation? 

The queen whom Lorcan had summoned for her. He'd brought Maeve 
to save her-- 

Elide's breath turned sharp in her throat. He'd betrayed them. Betrayed 
Aelin for her-- 

"What should I demand as payment for the girl?" Maeve mused, taking 
a few steps toward them, graceful as a moonbeam. "Why doesn't my 
Second tell me? So busy, Lorcan. You've been so, so busy these months." 

His voice was hoarse as he lowered his head. "I did it for you, Majesty." 

"Then where is my ring? Where are my keys?" 

A ring. Elide was willing to bet it was the golden one on her own finger, 
hidden beneath her other hand as she clenched them before her. 

But Lorcan pointed his chin toward Aelin. "She has them. Two keys." 

Cold clanged through Elide. "Lorcan." The guard's blade twitched at 
her throat. 

Aelin only leveled a cool stare at Lorcan. 

He didn't look at either Elide or Aelin. Didn't so much as acknowledge 
their existence as he went on, "Aelin has two, and probably has a good 
inkling where Erawan hides the third." 

"Lorcan," Elide pleaded. No--no, he wasn't about to do this, about to 
betray them again-- 

"Be quiet," he growled at her. 

Maeve's gaze again drifted down to Elide. The ancient, eternal darkness 
in it was smothering. "What familiarity you use when you speak his name, 
Lady of Perranth. What intimacy." 

Aelin's little snort was her only warning sign. "Don't you have better 
things to do than terrorize humans? Release the girl and let's settle this the 
fun way." 

Flame danced at Aelin's fingertips. 

No. Her magic had been emptied, still hovered near burnout. 

But Aelin stepped forward, nudging Manon with the side of her body as 
she passed--forcing the witch to back away. Aelin grinned. "Want to dance, 


Maeve?" 

But Aelin shot a cutting glance over her shoulder at Manon as if to say, 
Run. Grab Elide the moment Maeve's guard is down and run. 

Maeve returned Aelin's smile. "I don't think you'd be a suitable dance 
partner right now. Not when your magic is nearly depleted. Did you think 
my arrival was merely dependent upon Lorcan's summoning? Who do you 
think even whispered to Morath you were indeed down here? Of course, the 
fools didn't realize that when you had drained yourself on their armies, I'd 
be waiting. You were already exhausted after putting out the fires I had my 
armada ignite to tire you on Eyllwe's coast. It was a convenience that 
Lorcan gave your precise location and saved me the energy of tracking you 
down myself." 

A trap. An enormous, wicked trap. To drain Aelin's power over days-- 
weeks. But Aelin lifted a brow. "You brought an entire armada just to start a 
few fires?" 

"I brought an armada to see if you'd rise to the occasion. Which, 
apparently, Prince Rowan has done." 

Hope soared in Elide's chest. But then Maeve said, "The armada was a 
precaution. Just in case the ilken didn't arrive for you to wholly drain 
yourself ... I figured a few hundred ships would make for good kindling 
until I was ready." 

To sacrifice her own fleet--or part of it--to gain one prize ... This was 
madness. The queen was utterly insane. "Do something," Elide hissed at 
Lorcan, at Manon. "Do something." 

Neither of them responded. 

The flame around Aelin's fingers grew to encompass her hand 
her arm as she said to the ancient queen, "All I hear is a lot of chitchat." 

Maeve glanced at her escort, and they stepped away. Hauled Elide with 
them, the blade still at her throat. 

Aelin said sharply to Manon, "Get out of range." 

The witch fell back, but her eyes were on the guard holding Elide, 
gobbling down every detail she could. 

"You can't possibly hope to win," Maeve said, as if they were about to 
play cards. 

"At least we'll enjoy ourselves until the end," Aelin crooned back, 
flame now encasing her entirely. 





then 


"Oh, I have no interest in killing you," Maeve purred. 

Then they exploded. 

Flame slammed outward, red and golden--yjust as a wall of darkness 
lashed for Aelin. 

The impact shook the world. 

Even Manon was thrown on her ass. 

But Lorcan was already moving. 

The guard holding Elide showered her hair with blood as Lorcan slit his 
throat. 

The other two guards behind him died with a hatchet to the face, one 
after another. Elide surged up, her leg barking in pain, running for Manon 
on pure, blind instinct, but Lorcan gripped her by the collar of her tunic. 
"Stupid fool," he snapped, and she clawed at him-- 

"Lorcan, hold the girl," Maeve said quietly, not even looking toward 
them. "Don't get any stupid ideas about fleeing with her." He went utterly 
still, his hold tightening. 

Maeve and Aelin struck again. 

Light and darkness. 

Sand shuddered down the dunes, the waves rippled. 

Only now--Maeve had only dared attack Aelin now. 

Because Aelin at her full strength ... 

Aelin could beat her. 

But Aelin, nearly depleted of her power ... 

"Please," Elide begged Lorcan. But he held her firm, slave to the order 
Maeve had given, one eye on the battling queens, the other on the escorts 
who weren't foolish enough to approach after witnessing what he'd done to 
their companions. 

"Run," Lorcan said in her ear. "If you wish to live, run, Elide. Shove me 
off--work around her command. Push me, and run." 

She would not. She'd sooner die than flee like a coward, not when Aelin 
was going to the mat for all of them, when-- 

Darkness devoured flame. 

And even Manon flinched as Aelin was slammed back. 

A paper-thin wall of flame kept that darkness from hitting home. A wall 
that wavered-- 

Help. They needed help-- 


Maeve lashed to the left, and Aelin threw up a hand, fire deflecting. 

Aelin didn't see the blow to the right. Elide screamed in warning, but 
too late. 

A whip of black sliced into Aelin. 

She went down. 

And Elide thought the impact of Aelin Galathynius's knees hitting the 
sand might have been the most horrible sound she'd ever heard. 

Maeve did not waste her advantage. 

Darkness poured down, pounding again and again. Aelin deflected, but 
it got past her. 

There was nothing Elide could do as Aelin screamed. 

As that dark, ancient power struck her like a hammer over an anvil. 

Elide begged Manon, now mere feet away, "Do something." 

Manon ignored her, eyes fixed on the battle before them. 

Aelin crawled backward, blood sliding from her right nostril. Dripping 
on her white shirt. 

Maeve advanced, the darkness swirling around her like a fell wind. 

Aelin tried to rise. 

Tried, but her legs had given out. The Queen of Terrasen panted, fire 
flickering like dying embers around her. 

Maeve pointed with a finger. 

A black whip, faster than Aelin's fire, lashed out. Wrapped around her 
throat. Aelin gripped it, thrashing, her teeth bared, flame flaring over and 
over. 

"Why don't you use the keys, Aelin?" Maeve purred. "Surely you'd win 
that way." 

Use them, Elide begged her. Use them. 

But Aelin did not. 

The coil of darkness tightened around Aelin's throat. 

Flames sparked and died out. 

Then the darkness expanded, encompassing Aelin again and squeezing 
tight, squeezing until she was screaming, screaming in a way that Elide 
knew meant unfathomable agony-- 

A low, vicious snarl rippled from nearby, the only warning as a massive 
wolf leaped through the seagrasses and shifted. Fenrys. 


A heartbeat later, a mountain lion charged over a dune, beheld the 
scene, and shifted as well. Gavriel. 

"Let her go," Fenrys growled at the dark queen, advancing a step. "Let 
her go now." 

Maeve turned her head, that darkness still lashing Aelin. "Look who 
finally arrived. Another set of traitors." She smoothed a wrinkle in her 
flowing gown. "What a valiant effort you made, Fenrys, delaying your 
arrival on this beach for as long as you could withstand my summons." She 
clicked her tongue. "Did you enjoy playing loyal subject while panting after 
the young Queen of Fire?" 

As if in answer, the darkness squeezed in tight--and Aelin screamed 
again. 

"Stop it," Fenrys snapped. 

"Maeve, please," Gavriel said, exposing his palms to her. 

"Maeve?" the queen crooned. "Not Majesty? Has the Lion gone a bit 
feral? Perhaps too much time with his unchecked, half-breed bastard?" 

"Leave him out of this," Gavriel said too softly. 

But Maeve let the darkness around Aelin part. 

She was curled on her side, bleeding from both nostrils now, more 
blood dribbling from her panting mouth. 

Fenrys lunged for her. A wall of black slammed up between them. 

"I don't think so," Maeve crooned. 

Aelin gasped for air, eyes glassy with pain. Eyes that slid to Elide's. 
Aelin's bloody, chapped mouth formed the word again. Run. 

She would not. Could not. 

Aelin's arms shook as she tried to raise herself. And Elide knew there 
was no magic left. 

No fire left in the queen. Not one ember. 

And the only way Aelin could face this, accept this, was to go down 
swinging. Like Marion had. 

Aelin's wet, rasping breaths were the only sound above the crashing 
waves behind them. Even the battle had gone quiet in the distance. Over-- 
or perhaps they were all dead. 

Manon still stood there. Still did not move. Elide begged her, "Please. 
Please." 


Maeve smiled at the witch. "I have no quarrel with you, Blackbeak. 
Stay out of this and you are free to go where you wish." 

"Please," Elide pleaded. 

Manon's gold eyes were hard. Cold. She nodded to Maeve. "Agreed." 

Something in Elide's chest cleaved open. 

But Gavriel said from across their little circle, "Majesty: 
Aelin Galathynius to her own war here. Let us return home." 

"Home?" Maeve asked. The black wall between Fenrys and Aelin 
lowered--but the warrior did not try to cross. He just stared at Aelin, stared 
at her in that way Elide herself must be looking. He didn't break that stare 
until Maeve said to Gavriel, "Is Doranelle still your home?" 

"Yes, Majesty," Gavriel said calmly. "It 1s an honor to call it such." 

"Honor ... ," Maeve mused. "Yes, you and honor go hand in hand, don't 
they? But what of the honor of your vow, Gavriel?" 

"I have kept my vow to you." 

"Did I or did I not tell you to execute Lorcan on sight?" 

"There were ... circumstances that prevented it from happening. We 
tried." 

"Yet you failed. Am I not supposed to discipline my blood-bonded who 
fail me?" 

Gavriel lowered his head. "Of course--we will accept it. And I will also 
take on the punishment you intended for Aelin Galathynius." 

Aelin lifted her head slightly, glazed eyes going wide. She tried to 
speak, but the words had been broken from her, her voice blown out from 
screaming. Elide knew the word the queen mouthed. No. 

Not for her. Elide wondered if Gavriel's sacrifice was not only for 
Aelin's sake. But for Aedion's. So the son would not have to bear the pain 
of his queen being hurt 

"Aelin Galathynius,' Maeve mused. "So much talk about Aelin 
Galathynius. The Queen Who Was Promised. Well, Gavriel'--a vicious 
smile--"if you're so invested in her court, why don't you join it?" 

Fenrys tensed, preparing to lunge in front of the dark power for his 
friend. 

But Maeve said, "I sever the blood oath with you, Gavriel. Without 
honor, without good faith. You are dismissed from my service and stripped 
of your title." 





please. Leave 





99 





"You bitch," Fenrys snapped as Gavriel's breathing turned shallow. 

"Majesty, please--" Gavriel hissed, clapping a hand over his arm as 
invisible claws raked two lines down his skin, drawing blood that spilled 
into the grass. A similar mark appeared on Maeve's arm, her blood spilling. 

"It is done," she said simply. "Let the world know you, a male of honor, 
have none. That you betrayed your queen for another, for a bastard get of 
yours." 

Gavriel stumbled back--then collapsed in the sand, a hand shoved 
against his chest. Fenrys snarled, his face more lupine than Fae, but Maeve 
laughed softly. "Oh, you'd like for me to do the same, wouldn't you, 
Fenrys? But what greater punishment for the one who is a traitor to me in 
his very soul than to serve me forever?" 

Fenrys hissed, his breath coming in ragged gulps, and Elide wondered if 
he'd leap upon the queen and try to kill her. 

But Maeve turned to Aelin and said, "Get up." 

Aelin tried. Her body failed her. 

Maeve clicked her tongue, and an invisible hand hauled Aelin to her 
feet. Pain-fogged eyes cleared, then filled with cold rage as Aelin took in 
the approaching queen. 

An assassin, Elide reminded herself. Aelin was an assassin, and if 
Maeve got close enough ... 

But Maeve didn't. And those invisible hands cut the tethers on Aelin's 
sword belts. Goldryn thunked to the ground. Then daggers slid from their 
sheaths. 

"So many weapons,' Maeve contemplated as the invisible hands 
disarmed Aelin with brutal efficiency. Even blades hidden beneath clothes 
found their way out--slicing as they went. Blood bloomed beneath Aelin's 
shirt and pants. Why did she stand there-- 

Gathering her strength. For one last strike. One last stand. 

Let the queen believe her broken. "Why?" Aelin rasped. Buying herself 
time. 

Maeve toed a fallen dagger, the blade edged with Aelin's blood. "Why 
bother with you at all? Because I can't very well let you sacrifice yourself 
to forge a new Lock, can I? Not when you already have what I want. And I 
have known for a very, very long time that you would give me what I seek, 
Aelin Galathynius, and have taken the steps toward ensuring that." 


99 


Aelin breathed, "What?" 

Maeve said, "Haven't you figured it out? Why I wanted your mother to 
bring you to me, why I demanded such things of you this spring?" 

None of them dared move. 

Maeve snorted, a delicate, feminine sound of triumph. "Brannon stole 
the keys from me, after I took them from the Valg. They were mine, and he 
snatched them. And then he mated with that goddess of yours, breeding the 
fire into the bloodline, ensuring I would think hard before touching his land, 
his heirs. But all bloodlines fade. And I knew a time would come when 
Brannon's flames would dim to a flicker, and I'd be poised to strike." 

Aelin sagged against the hands that held her up. 

"But in my dark power, I saw a glimmer of the future. I saw that Mala's 
power would surge again. And that you would lead me to the keys. Only 
you--the one Brannon left clues for, the one who could find all three. And I 
saw who you were, what you were. I saw who you loved. I saw your mate." 

The sea breeze hissing through the grasses was the only sound. 

"What a powerhouse you two would be--you and Prince Rowan. And 
any offspring of that union ..." A vicious smirk. "You and Rowan could 
rule this continent if you wished. But your children ... your children would 
be powerful enough to rule an empire that could sweep the world." 

Aelin closed her eyes. The Fae males were shaking their heads slowly-- 
not believing it. 

"I didn't know when you would be born, but when Prince Rowan 
Whitethorn came into this world, when he came of age and was the 
strongest purebred Fae male in my realm ... you were still not there. And I 
knew what I would have to do. To leash you. To break you to my will, to 
hand over those keys without thought once you were strong and trained 
enough to acquire them." 

Aelin's shoulders shook. Tears slid out past her closed eyes. 

"It was so easy to tug on the right psychic thread that day Rowan saw 
Lyria at the market. To shove him down that other path, to trick those 
instincts. A slight altering of fate." 

"Oh, gods," Fenrys breathed. 

Maeve said, "So your mate was given to another. And I let him fall in 
love, let him get her with child. And then I broke him. No one ever asked 
how those enemy forces came to pass by his mountain home." 


Aelin's knees gave out completely. Only the invisible hands kept her 
upright as she wept. 

"He took the blood oath without question. And I knew that whenever 
you were born, whenever you'd come of age ... Pd ensure that your paths 
crossed, and you'd take one look at each other and I'd have you by the 
throat. Anything I asked for, you'd give to me. Even the keys. For your 
mate, you could do no less. You almost did that day in Doranelle." 

Slowly, Aelin slid her feet under herself again, the movement so pained 
that Elide cringed. But Aelin lifted her head, lip curling back from her teeth. 

"I will kill you," Aelin snarled at the Fae Queen. 

"That's what you said to Rowan after you met him, wasn't it?" Maeve's 
faint smile lingered. "I'd pushed and pushed your mother to bring you to 
me, so you could meet him, so I could have you at last when Rowan felt the 
bond, but she refused. And we know how well that turned out for her. And 
during those ten years afterward, I knew you were alive. Somewhere. But 
when you came to me ... when you and your mate looked at each other with 
only hate in your eyes ... PI admit I did not anticipate it. That I had broken 
Rowan Whitethorn so thoroughly that he did not recognize his own mate-- 
that you were so broken by your own pain you didn't notice, either. And 
when the signs appeared, the carranam bond washed away any suspicion 
on his part that you might be his. But not you. How long has it been, Aelin, 
since you realized he was your mate?" 

Aelin said nothing, her eyes churning with rage and grief and despair. 

Elide whispered, "Leave her alone." Lorcan's grip on her tightened in 
warning. 

Maeve ignored her. "Well? When did you know?" 

"At Temis's temple," Aelin admitted, glancing to Manon. "The moment 
the arrow went through his shoulder. Months ago." 

"And you've hidden it from him, no doubt to save him from any guilt 
regarding Lyria, any sort of emotional distress ..." Maeve clicked her 
tongue. "What a noble little liar you are." 

Aelin stared at nothing, her eyes going blank. 

"I had planned for him to be here," Maeve said, frowning at the horizon. 
"Since letting you two go that day in Doranelle was so that you could lead 
me to the keys again. I even let you think you'd gotten away with it, by 


freeing him. You had no idea that I unleashed you. But if he's not here ... 
I'll have to make do." 

Aelin stiffened. Fenrys snarled in warning. 

Maeve shrugged. "If it's any consolation, Aelin, you would have had a 
thousand years with Prince Rowan. Longer." 

The world slowed, and Elide could hear her own blood roaring in her 
ears as Maeve said, "My sister Mab's line ran true. The full powers, shifting 
abilities, and the immortality of the Fae. You're likely about five years 
away from Settling." 

Aelin's face crumpled. This was not a draining of magic and physical 
strength, but of spirit. 

"Perhaps we'll celebrate your Settling together," Maeve mused, "since I 
certainly have no plans to waste you on that Lock. To waste the keys, when 
they are meant to be wielded, Aelin." 

"Maeve, please," Fenrys breathed. 

Maeve examined her immaculate nails. "What I find to be truly amusing 
is that it seems I didn't even need you to be Rowan's mate. Or really need 
to break him at all. A fascinating experiment in my own powers, if 
anything. But since I doubt you'll still go willingly, not at least without 
trying to die on me first, I'll let you have a choice." 

Aelin seemed to be bracing herself as Maeve lifted a hand and said, 
"Cairn." 

The males went rigid. Lorcan turned near-feral behind Elide, subtly 
trying to drag her back, to work around the order he'd been given. 

A handsome, brown-haired warrior walked toward them from the 
cluster of escorts. Handsome, if it weren't for the sadistic cruelty singing in 
his blue eyes. If it wasn't for the blades at his sides, the whip curled along 
one hip, the sneering smile. She'd seen that smile before--on Vernon's 
face. On so many faces at Morath. 

"Allow me to introduce the newest member of my cadre, as you like to 
call them. Cairn, meet Aelin Galathynius." 

Cairn stepped up to his queen's side. And the look the male gave Elide's 
queen made her stomach turn over. Sadist--yes, that was the word for him, 
without him even saying one himself. 

"Cairn," Maeve said, "is trained in abilities that you have in common. 
Of course, you only had a few years to learn the art of torment, but ... 


perhaps Cairn can teach you some of the things he's learned in his centuries 
of practicing." 

Fenrys was pale with rage. "Maeve, I beg you--" 

Darkness slammed into Fenrys, shoving him to his knees, forcing his 
head to the dirt. "That is enough," Maeve hissed. 

Maeve was smiling again when she turned back to Aelin. "I said you 
have a choice. And you do. Either you come willingly with me and get 
acquainted with Cairn, or..." 

Those eyes slid to Lorcan. To Elide. 

And Elide's heart stopped as Maeve said, "Or I still take you--and 
bring Elide Lochan with us. I'm certain she and Cairn will get along 
wonderfully." 


Chapter 66


Aelin's body hurt. 

Everything hurt. Her blood, her breath, her bones. 

There was no magic left. Nothing left to save her. 

"No," Lorcan said softly. 

Just turning her head sparked agony down her spine. But Aelin looked 
at Elide, at Lorcan forced to hold her, his face white with pure terror as he 
glanced between Cairn and Maeve and Elide. Manon was doing the same-- 
sizing up the odds, how fast she'd have to be to clear the area. 

Good. Good--Manon would get Elide out. The witch had been waiting 
for Aelin to make a move, not realizing that ... she had nothing left. There 
was no power left for a final strike. 

And that dark power was still coiled around her bones, so tightly that 
one move of aggression ... one move, and her bones would snap. 

Maeve said to Lorcan, "No to what, Lorcan? Elide Lochan being taken 
with us if Aelin decides to put up a fight, or my generous offer to leave 
Elide be if Her Majesty comes willingly?" 

One look at the brown-haired Fae warrior--Cairn--standing at Maeve's 
side, and Aelin had known what he was. She'd killed enough of them over 
the years. She'd spent time with Rourke Farran. What he'd do to Elide ... 
Lorcan also knew what a male like Cairn would do to a young woman. And 
if he was sanctioned by Maeve herself ... 

Lorcan said, "She is innocent. Take the queen, and let us go." 

Manon even snapped at Maeve, "She belongs to the Ironteeth. If you 
have no quarrel with me, then you have no quarrel with her. Leave Elide 
Lochan out of it." 

Maeve ignored Manon and drawled to Lorcan, "I command you to stand 
down. I command you to watch and do nothing. I command you to not 
move or speak until I say so. The order applies to you as well, Fenrys." 





And Lorcan obeyed. So did Fenrys. Their bodies simply stiffened--and 
then nothing. 

Elide twisted to beg Lorcan, "You can stop this, you can fight it--" 

Lorcan didn't even look at her. 

Aelin knew Elide would fight. Would not understand that Maeve had 
been playing this game for centuries, and had waited until this moment, 
until the trap was perfect, to seize her. 

Aelin found Maeve smiling at her. She had played, and gambled, and 
lost. 

Maeve nodded as if to say yes. 

The unspoken question danced in Aelin's eyes as Elide screamed at 
Lorcan, at Manon, to help. But the witch knew her orders. Her task. 

Maeve read the question in Aelin's face and said, "I will bear the keys 
in one hand, and Aelin Fire-Bringer in the other." 

She'd have to break her first. Kill her or break ... 

Cairn grinned. 

The escorts were now hauling something up the beach, from the 
longboat they'd rowed over from their awaiting ship. Already, the dark sails 
were unfurling. 

Elide faced Maeve, who did not deign to glance her way. "Please, please 


99 


Aelin simply nodded at the Fae Queen. Her acceptance and surrender. 

Maeve bowed her head, triumph dancing on her red lips. "Lorcan, 
release her." 

The warrior's hands slackened at his sides. 

And because she had won, Maeve even loosened her power's grip on 
Aelin's bones. Allowed Aelin to turn to Elide and say, "Go with Manon. 
She will take care of you." 

Elide began crying, shoving away from Lorcan. "Ill go with you, PH 
come with you--" 

The girl would. The girl would face Cairn, and Maeve ... But Terrasen 
would need that sort of courage. If it was to survive, if it was to heal, 
Terrasen would need Elide Lochan. 

"Tell the others," Aelin breathed, trying to find the right words. "Tell 
the others that I am sorry. Tell Lysandra to remember her promise, and that I 
will never stop being grateful. Tell Aedion ... Tell him it is not his fault, 


and that ..." Her voice cracked. "I wish he'd been able to take the oath, but 
Terrasen will look to him now, and the lines must not break." 

Elide nodded, tears sliding down her blood-splattered face. 

"And tell Rowan ..." 

Aelin's soul splintered as she saw the iron box the escorts now carried 
between them. An ancient, iron coffin. Big enough for one person. Crafted 
for her. 

"And tell Rowan," Aelin said, fighting her own sob, "that I'm sorry I 
lied. But tell him it was all borrowed time anyway. Even before today, I 
knew it was all just borrowed time, but I still wish we'd had more of it." 
She fought past her trembling mouth. "Tell him he has to fight. He must 
save Terrasen, and remember the vows he made to me. And tell him ... tell 
him thank you--for walking that dark path with me back to the light." 

They opened the lid of the box, pulling out long, heavy chains within. 

One of the escorts handed Maeve an ornate iron mask. She examined it 
in her hands. 

The mask, the chains, the box ... they had been crafted long before now. 
Centuries ago. Forged to contain and break Mala's scion. 

Aelin glanced at Lorcan, whose dark eyes were fixed on her own. 

And gratitude shone there. For sparing the young woman he'd given his 
heart to, whether he knew it or not. 

Elide begged Maeve one last time, "Don't do this." 

Aelin knew it would do her no good. So she said to Elide, "I'm glad we 
met. I'm proud to know you. And I think your mother would have been 
proud of you, too, Elide." 

Maeve lowered the mask and drawled to Aelin, "Rumor claims you will 
bow to no one, Heir of Fire." That serpentine smile. "Well, now you will 
bow to me." 

She pointed to the sand. 

Aelin obeyed. 

Her knees barked as she dropped to the ground. 

"Lower." 

Aelin slid her body until her brow was in the sand. She did not let 
herself feel it, let her soul feel it. 

"Good." 

Elide was sobbing, wordlessly begging. 


"Take off your shirt." 

Aelin hesitated--trealizing where this was going. 

Why Cairn's belt carried a whip. 

"Take off your shirt." 

Aelin tugged her shirt out of her pants and slung it over her head, 
tossing it in the sand beside her. Then she removed the flexible cloth around 
her breasts. 

"Varik, Heiron." Two Fae males came forward. 

Aelin didn't fight as they each gripped her by an arm and hauled her up. 
Spread her arms wide. The sea air kissed her breasts, her navel. 

"Ten lashes, Cairn. Let Her Majesty have a taste of what to expect when 
we reach our destination, if she does not cooperate." 

"It would be my pleasure, Lady." 

Aelin held Cairn's vicious gaze, willing ice into her veins as he thumbed 
free his whip. As he raked his eyes over her body and smiled. A canvas for 
him to paint with blood and pain. 

Maeve said, the mask dangling from her fingers, "Why don't you count 
for us, Aelin?" 

Aelin kept her mouth shut. 

"Count, or we'll begin again with each stroke you miss. You decide how 
long this goes on for. Unless you'd rather Elide Lochan receive these 
strokes." 

No. Never. 

Never anyone else but her. Never. 

But as Cairn walked slowly, savoring each step, as he let that whip drag 
along the ground, her body betrayed her. Began shaking. 

She knew the pain. Knew what it'd feel like, what it'd sound like. 

Her dreams were still full of it. 

No doubt why Maeve had picked a whipping, why she'd done it to 
Rowan in Doranelle. 

Cairn halted. She felt him studying the tattoo on her back. Rowan's 
loving words, written there in the Old Language. 

Cairn snorted. Then she felt him revel in how he'd destroy that tattoo. 

"Begin," Maeve said. 

Cairn's breath sucked in. 


And even bracing herself, even clamping down hard, there was nothing 
to prepare for the crack, the sting, the pain. She did not let herself cry out, 
only hissed through her teeth. 

A whip wielded by an overseer at Endovier was one thing. 

One wielded by a full-blooded Fae male ... 

Blood slid down the back of her pants, her split skin screaming. 

But she knew how to pace herself. How to yield to the pain. How to 
take it. 

"What number was that, Aelin?" 

She would not. She would never count for that rutting bitch-- 

"Start over, Cairn," Maeve said. 

A breathy laugh. Then the crack and the pain and Aelin arched, the 
tendons in her neck near snapping as she panted through clenched teeth. 
The males holding her gripped her firm enough to bruise. 

Maeve and Cairn waited. 

Aelin refused to say the word. To start the count. She'd die before she 
did it. 

"Oh gods, oh gods," Elide sobbed. 

"Start over," Maeve merely ordered over the girl. 

So Cairn did. 

Again. 

Again. 

Again. 

They started over nine times before Aelin finally screamed. The blow 
had been right atop another one, tearing skin down to the bone. 

Again. 

Again. 

Again. 

Again. 

Cairn was panting. Aelin refused to speak. 

"Start over," Maeve repeated. 

"Majesty," murmured one of the males holding her. "It might be prudent 
to postpone until later." 

"There's still plenty of skin," Cairn snapped. 

But the male said, "Others are approaching--still far off, but 
approaching." 


Rowan. 

Aelin whimpered then. Time--she had needed time-- 

Maeve made a small noise of distaste. "We'll continue later. Get her 
ready." 

Aelin could barely lift her head as the males heaved her up. The 
movement set her body roaring in such pain that darkness swarmed in. But 
she fought it, gritted her teeth and silently roared back at that agony, that 
darkness. 

A few feet away, Elide slid to her knees as if she'd beg until her body 
gave out, but Manon caught her. "We're going now," Manon said, tugging 
her away--inland. 

"No," Elide spat, thrashing. 

Lorcan's eyes widened, but with Maeve's command, he couldn't move, 
couldn't do anything as Manon slammed the hilt of Wind-Cleaver into the 
side of Elide's head. 

The girl dropped like a stone. That was all Manon needed to haul her 
over a shoulder and say to Maeve, "Good luck." Her eyes slid to Aelin's 
once--only once. Then she looked away. 

Maeve ignored the witch as Manon prowled toward the heart of the 
marshes. Lorcan's body strained. 

Strained--like he was fighting that blood oath with everything in him. 

Aelin didn't care. 

The males half dragged her toward Maeve. 

Toward the iron box. And the chains. And the iron mask. 

Whorls of fire, little suns, and embers had been shaped into its dark 
surface. A mockery of the power it was to contain--the power Maeve had 
needed to ensure was fully drained before she locked her up. The only way 
she could ever lock her up. 

Every inch her feet dragged through the sand was a lifetime; every inch 
was a heartbeat. Blood soaked her pants. She likely wouldn't be able to heal 
her wounds within all that iron. Not until Maeve decided to heal them 
herself. 

But Maeve wouldn't let her die. Not with the Wyrdkeys in the balance. 
Not yet. 

Time--she was grateful Elena had given her that stolen time. 





Grateful she had met them all, that she had seen some small part of the 
world, had heard such lovely music, had danced and laughed and known 
true friendship. Grateful that she had found Rowan. 

She was grateful. 

So Aelin Galathynius dried her tears. 

And did not fight when Maeve strapped that beautiful iron mask over 
her face. 


Chapter 67


Manon kept walking. 

She didn't dare look back. Didn't dare give that ancient, cold-eyed 
queen one hint that Aelin did not possess the Wyrdkeys. That Aelin had 
slipped them both into Manon's pocket when she'd nudged her. Elide would 
hate her for 1t--already did hate her for it. 

Let that be the cost. 

One look from Aelin and she'd known what she had to do. 

Get the keys away from Maeve. Get Elide away. 

They had forged an iron box to contain the Queen of Terrasen. 

Elide stirred, at last coming to, just as they were nearly out of hearing 
range. She began thrashing, and Manon dumped her behind a dune, 
gripping the back of her neck so tightly Elide stilled at the iron nails 
piercing her skin. 

"Silence," Manon hissed, and Elide obeyed. 

Keeping low, they peered through the grasses. Only a moment--she 
could spare only a moment to watch, to glean where Maeve was taking the 
Queen of Terrasen. 

Lorcan remained frozen as Maeve had commanded. Gavriel was barely 
conscious, panting in the grass, as if ripping that blood oath from him had 
been as grave as any physical wound. 

Fenrys--Fenrys's eyes were alive with hatred as he watched Maeve and 
Cairn. Blood coated Cairn's whip, still dangling at his side as Maeve's 
soldiers finished strapping that mask over Aelin's face. 

Then they clamped irons around her wrists. 

Ankles. 

Neck. 

No one healed her ravaged back, barely more than a bloody slab of 
meat, as they guided her into the iron box. Made her lie upon her wounds. 


And then slid the lid into place. Locked it. 

Elide vomited in the grass. 

Manon put a hand on the girl's back as the males began carrying the box 
down the dunes, to the boat, and the ship beyond. 

"Fenrys, go," Maeve ordered, pointing to the ship. 

Breathing raggedly but unable to refuse the order, Fenrys followed. He 
glanced once at the white shirt discarded in the sand. It was splattered with 
blood--spray from the whipping. 

Then he was gone, stepping through air and wind and into nothing. 

Alone with Lorcan, Maeve said to the warrior, "You have done all this 
--for me?" 

He did not move. Maeve said, "Speak." 

Lorcan loosed a shuddering breath and said, "Yes. Yes--it was all for 
you. All of it." 

Elide gripped the seagrass in fistfuls, and Manon half wondered if she'd 
grow iron nails and shred it apart at the fury in her face. The hate. 

Maeve stepped over Aelin's blood-splattered shirt, and brushed her 
hand over Lorcan's cheek. "I have no use," she crooned, "for self-righteous 
males who think they know best." 

He stiffened. "Majesty--" 

"I strip you of the blood oath. I strip you of your assets and your titles 
and your properties. You, like Gavriel, are released with dishonor and 
shame. You are exiled from Doranelle for your disobedience, your 
treachery. Should you step foot inside my borders, you will die." 

"Majesty, I beg you--" 

"Go beg someone else. I have no use for a warrior I cannot trust. I 
rescind my kill order. Letting you live with the shame will be far worse for 
you, I think." 

Blood welled at his wrist, then hers. Spilling on the ground. 

Lorcan fell to his knees. 

"I do not suffer fools gladly," Maeve said, leaving him in the sand, and 
walked away. 

As if she'd dealt him a blow, the twin to Gavriel's, Lorcan couldn't 
seem to move, to think or breathe. He tried crawling, though. Toward 
Maeve. The bastard tried crawling. 


"We need to go," Manon murmured. The moment Maeve checked to see 
where those keys were ... They had to go. 

A roar grumbled on the horizon. 

Abraxos. 

Her heart thundered in her chest, joy sparking, but-- 

Elide remained in the grass. Watching Lorcan crawl toward the queen 
now striding across the beach, black gown flowing behind her. 

Watching the boat row to the awaiting ship, that iron coffin in its center, 
Maeve sitting beside it, one hand on the lid. For her sanity, Manon prayed 
that Aelin wouldn't be awake the entire time she was inside. 

And for the sake of their world, Manon prayed the Queen of Terrasen 
could survive it. 

If only so Aelin could then die for them all. 


Chapter 68


There was so much blood. 

It had spread to where Lorcan was kneeling, gleaming bright as it 
soaked into the sand. 

It covered her shirt, discarded and forgotten beside him. It even 
speckled the scabbards of her swords and knives, littered around him like 
bones. 

What Maeve had done ... 

What Aelin had done ... 

There was a hole in his chest. 

And there was so much blood. 

Wings and roaring and he still couldn't look up. Couldn't bring himself 
to care. 

Elide's voice cut across the world, saying to someone, "The ship--the 
ship just vanished; she left without realizing we have the--" 

Whoops of joy--female cries of happiness. 

Thunderous, swift steps. 

Then a hand gripping his hair, yanking back his head as a dagger settled 
along his throat. As Rowan's face, calm with lethal wrath, appeared in his 
vision. 

"Where is Aelin." 

There was pure panic, too--pure panic as Whitethorn saw the blood, the 
scattered blades, and the shirt. 

"Where is Aelin."' 

What had he done, what had he done-- 

Pain sliced Lorcan's neck, warm blood dribbled down his throat, his 
chest. 

Rowan hissed, "Where is my wife?" 

Lorcan swayed where he knelt. 


Wife. 

Wife. 

"Oh, gods," Elide sobbed as she overheard, the words carrying the 
sound of Lorcan's own fractured heart. "Oh, gods ..." 

And for the first time in centuries, Lorcan wept. 

Rowan dug the dagger deeper into Lorcan's neck, even as tears slid 
down Lorcan's face. 

What that woman had done ... 

Aelin had known. That Lorcan had betrayed her and summoned Maeve 
here. That she had been living on borrowed time. 

And she had married Whitethorn ... so Terrasen could have a king. 
Perhaps had been spurred into action because she knew Lorcan had already 
betrayed her, that Maeve was coming ... 

And Lorcan had not helped her. 

Whitethorn's wife. 

His mate. 

Aelin had let them whip and chain her, had gone willingly with Maeve, 
so Elide didn't enter Cairn's clutches. And it had been just as much a 
sacrifice for Elide as it had been a gift to him. 

She had bowed to Maeve. 

For Elide. 

"Please," Rowan begged, his voice breaking as that calm fury fractured. 

"Maeve took her," Manon said, approaching. 

Gavriel rasped from where he knelt nearby, reeling from the severing of 
his blood oath, "She used the oath to keep us down--keep us from helping. 
Even Lorcan." 

Rowan still didn't remove the knife from Lorcan's throat. 

Lorcan had been wrong. He had been so wrong. 

And he could not entirely regret it, not if Elide was safe, but ... 

Aelin had refused to count. Cairn had unleashed his full strength on her 
with that whip, and she had refused to give them the satisfaction of 
counting. 

"Where is the ship," Aedion demanded, then swore at the bloody shirt 
nearby. He grabbed Goldryn, frantically wiping the blood specks off the 
scabbard with his jacket. 

"It vanished," Elide said again. "It just ... vanished." 


Whitethorn stared down at him, agony and despair in those eyes. And 
Lorcan whispered, "I'm sorry." 

Rowan dropped the knife, released the fist gripping Lorcan's hair. 
Staggered back a step. In the grass nearby, Dorian knelt beside Gavriel, a 
faint light glowing around them. Healing the wounds in his arms. There was 
nothing to be done for the soul-wound Maeve had dealt him, dealt Lorcan 
as well, in severing that oath with such dishonor. 

Manon came closer, her witches now flanking her. They all sniffed at 
the blood. A golden-haired one swore softly. 

Manon told them about the Lock. 

About Elena. About the cost the gods demanded of her. Demanded of 
Aelin. 

But it was Elide who then took up the thread, leaning against Lysandra, 
who was staring at that blood and that shirt as if it were a corpse, telling 
them what had happened on these dunes. What Aelin had sacrificed. 

She told Rowan that he was Aelin's mate. Told him about Lyria. 

She told them about the whipping, and the mask, and the box. 

When Elide finished, they were silent. And Lorcan only watched as 
Aedion turned to Lysandra and snarled, "You knew." 

Lysandra did not flinch. "She asked me--that day on the boat. To help 
her. She told me the suspected price to banish Erawan and restore the keys. 
What I needed to do." 

Aedion snarled, "What could you possibly ..." 

Lysandra lifted her chin. 

Rowan breathed, "Aelin would die to forge the new Lock to seal the 
keys into the gate--to banish Erawan. But no one would know. No one but 
us. Not while you wore her skin for the rest of your life." 

Aedion dragged a hand through his blood-caked hair. "But any offspring 
with Rowan wouldn't look anything like--" 

Lysandra's face was pleading. "You would fix that, Aedion. With me." 

With the golden hair, the Ashryver eyes ... If that line bred true, the 
shifter's offspring could pass as royal. Aelin wanted Rowan on the throne-- 
but it would be Aedion secretly siring the heirs. 

Aedion flinched as if he'd been struck. "And when were you going to 
reveal this? Before or after I thought I was taking my gods-damned cousin 
to bed for whatever reason you concocted?" 


Lysandra said softly, "I will not apologize to you. I serve her. And I am 
willing to spend the rest of my life pretending to be her so that her sacrifice 
isn't in vain--" 

"You can go to hell," Aedion snapped. "You can go to hell, you lying 
bitch!" 

Lysandra's answering snarl wasn't human. 

Rowan just took Goldryn from the general and walked toward the sea, 
the wind tossing his silver hair. 

Lorcan rose to his feet, swaying again. But Elide was there. 

And there was nothing of the young woman he'd come to know in her 
pale, taut face. Nothing of her in the raw voice as Elide said to Lorcan, "I 
hope you spend the rest of your miserable, immortal life suffering. I hope 
you spend it alone. I hope you live with regret and guilt in your heart and 
never find a way to endure it." 

Then she was heading for the Thirteen. The golden-haired one held up 
an arm, and Elide slipped beneath it, entering a sanctuary of wings and 
claws and teeth. 

Lysandra stormed to tend to Gavriel, who had the good sense not to 
flinch at her still-snarling face, and Lorcan looked to Aedion to find the 
young general already watching him. 

Hatred shone in Aedion's eyes. Pure hatred. "Even before you got the 
order to stand down, you did nothing to help her. You summoned Maeve 
here. I will never forget that." 

Then he was striding for the beach--to where Rowan knelt in the sand. 


Asterin was alive. 

The Thirteen were alive. And it was joy in Manon's heart--joy, she 
realized, as she beheld those smiling faces and smiled back. 

She said to Asterin, all of them standing among their wyverns on a dune 
overlooking the sea, "How?" 

Asterin brushed a hand over Elide's hair as the girl wept into her 
shoulder. "Your grandmother's bitches gave us one hell of a chase, but we 
managed to gut them. We've spent the past month looking for you. But 
Abraxos found us and seemed to know where you were, so we followed 


him." She scratched at some dried blood on her cheek. "And saved your 
ass, apparently." 

Not soon enough, Manon thought, seeing Elide's silent tears, the way 
the humans and Fae were either standing or arguing or just doing nothing. 

Not soon enough to stop this. To save Aelin Galathynius. 

"What do we do now?" Sorrel asked from where she leaned against her 
bull's flank, wrapping up a slice in her forearm. 

The Thirteen all looked to Manon, all waited. 

She dared to ask, "Did you hear what my grandmother said before ... 
everything?" 

"The Shadows told us," Asterin said, eyes dancing. 

"And?" 

"And what?" Sorrel grunted. "So you're half Crochan." 

"Crochan Queen." And heir to Rhiannon Crochan's likeness. Had the 
Ancients noted it? 

Asterin shrugged. "Five centuries of pure-blooded Ironteeth couldn't 
bring us home. Maybe you can." 

A child not of war ... but of peace. 

"And will you follow me?" Manon asked them quietly. "To do what 
needs to be done before we can return to the Wastes?" 

Aelin Galathynius had not beseeched Elena for another fate. She had 
only asked for one thing, one request of the ancient queen: 

Will you come with me? For the same reason Manon had now asked 
them. 

As one, the Thirteen lifted their fingers to their brows. As one, they 
lowered them. 

Manon looked toward the sea, her throat tight. 

"Aelin Galathynius willingly handed over her freedom so an Ironteeth 
witch could walk free,' Manon said. Elide straightened, pulling from 
Asterin's arms. But Manon continued, "We owe her a life debt. And more 
than that ... It is time that we became better than our foremothers. We are 
all children of this land." 

"What are you going to do?" Asterin breathed, her eyes so bright. 

Manon looked behind them. To the north. 

"I am going to find the Crochans. And I am going to raise an army with 
them. For Aelin Galathynius. And her people. And for ours." 


"They' Il never trust us," Sorrel said. 

Asterin drawled, "Then we'll have to just be our charming selves." 

Some of them smirked; some of them shifted on their feet. 

Manon said again to her Thirteen, "Will you follow me?" 

And when they all touched their fingers to their brows again, Manon 
returned the gesture. 


Rowan and Aedion were sitting silently on the beach. Gavriel had 
recovered enough from the shock of the oath's severing that he and Lorcan 
were now standing atop the bluff, talking quietly; Lysandra was sitting 
alone, in ghost leopard form, amongst the waving seagrasses; and Dorian 
was just ... watching them from the apex of a dune. 

What Aelin had done ... what she'd lied about ... 

Some of the blood on the ground had dried. 

If Aelin was gone, if her life would indeed be the cost if she ever got 
free ... 

"Maeve doesn't have the two keys," Manon said from Dorian's side, 
having crept up silently. Her coven lingered behind her, Elide ensconced 
within their ranks. "In case you were concerned." 

Lorcan and Gavriel turned toward them. Then Lysandra. 

Dorian dared to ask, "Then where are they?" 

"I have them," Manon said simply. "Aelin slid them into my pocket." 

Oh, Aelin. Aelin. She'd worked Maeve into such a frenzy, made the 
queen so focused on capturing her that she hadn't thought to confirm if 
Aelin held the keys before she vanished. 

She'd been dealt such a wicked, impossible hand--and yet Aelin had 
made it count. One last time, she'd made it count. 

"It's why I couldn't do anything about it," Manon said. "To help her. I 
had to look uninvolved. Neutral." From where he sat on the beach below, 
Aedion had twisted toward them, his keen Fae hearing feeding him every 
word. Manon said to all of them, "I am sorry. I'm sorry I couldn't help." 

She reached into the pocket of her riding leathers and extended the 
Amulet of Orynth and a sliver of black stone to Dorian. He balked. 

"Elena said Mala's bloodline can stop this. It runs in both your houses." 


The golden eyes were weary--heavy. He realized what Manon was 
asking. 

Aelin had never planned to see Terrasen again. 

She had married Rowan knowing she would have months at best, days 
at the worst, with him. But she would give Terrasen a legal king. To hold 
her territory together. 

She had made plans for all of them--and none for herself. 

"The quest does not end here," Dorian said softly. 

Manon shook her head. And he knew she meant more than the keys, 
than the war, as she said, "No, it does not." 

He took the keys from her. They throbbed and flickered, warming his 
palm. A foreign, horrible presence, and yet ... all that stood between them 
and destruction. 

No, the quest did not end here. Not even close. Dorian slid the keys into 
his pocket. 

And the road that now sprawled away before him, curving into 
unknown, awaiting shadow ... it did not frighten him. 


Chapter 69


Rowan had married Aelin before dawn barely two days ago. 

Aedion and Lysandra had been the only witnesses as they'd awoken the 
bleary-eyed captain, who married them quickly and quietly and signed a 
vow of secrecy. 

They'd had fifteen minutes in their cabin to consummate that marriage. 

Aedion still carried the formal documents; the captain bearing the 
duplicates. 

Rowan had been kneeling on that spit of beach for half an hour now. 
Silent, wandering the paths of his churning thoughts. Aedion had kept him 
company, staring blankly at the sea. 

Rowan had known. 

Part of him had known that Aelin was his mate. And had turned away 
from that knowledge, again and again, out of respect for Lyria, out of terror 
for what it'd mean. He'd leapt in front of her at Skull's Bay knowing it, 
deep down. Knowing mates aware of the bond could not bear to harm each 
other, and that it might be the only force to compel her to regain control 
from Deanna. And even when she had proved him right ... He had turned 
from that proof, still unready, pushing it from his mind even as he claimed 
her in every other way. 

Aelin had known, though. That he was her mate. And she had not 
pushed it, or demanded he face it, because she loved him, and he knew 
she'd rather carve out her own heart than cause him pain or distress. 

His Fireheart. 

His equal, his friend, his lover. His wife. 

His mate. 

That gods-damned bitch had put her in an iron box. 

She'd whipped his mate so brutally that he'd rarely seen such blood 
spilled as a result. Then chained her. Then put Aelin in a veritable iron 


coffin, still bleeding, still hurting. 

To contain her. To break her. To torture her. 

His Fireheart, locked in the dark. 

She'd tried to tell him. Right before the ilken converged. 

Tried to tell him she'd vomited her guts up on the ship that day not 
because she was pregnant but because she'd realized she was going to die. 
That the cost of sealing the gate, forging a new Lock to do so, was her life. 
Her immortal life. 

Goldryn lying beside him, its ruby dull in the bright sun, Rowan 
gathered up two fistfuls of sand and let the grains slide out, let the wind 
carry them toward the sea. 

It was all borrowed time anyway. 

Aelin did not expect them to come for her. 

She, who had come for them, who had found them all. She had arranged 
for everything to fall into place when she yielded her life. When she gave 
up a thousand years to save them. 

And Rowan knew she believed they'd make the right choice, the wise 
choice, and remain here. Lead their armies to victory--the armies she'd 
secured for them, guessing that she wouldn't be there to see it through. 

She did not think she'd ever see him again. 

He did not accept that. 

He would not accept that. 

And he would not accept that he had found her, and she had found him, 
and they had survived such sorrow and pain and despair together, only to be 
cleaved apart. He would not accept the fate that had been dealt to her, 
would not accept that her life was the asking price for saving this world. 
Her life, or Dorian's. 

He would not accept it for one heartbeat. 

Footsteps thudded on the sand, and he scented Lorcan before he 
bothered to look. For half a breath, he debated killing the male where he 
stood. 

Rowan knew that today--today he'd win. Something had fractured in 
Lorcan, and if Rowan attacked now, the other male would die. Lorcan 
might not even put up much of a fight. 

Lorcan's granite-hewn face was hard, but his eyes ... That was agony in 
them. And regret. 


The others flowed down the dunes, the witch's coven remaining behind, 
and Aedion rose to his feet. 

They all stared at Rowan as he remained kneeling. 

The sea rolled away, undulating under the clearing blue sky. 

He speared that bond into the world, casting it wide as a net. Flinging it 
out with his magic, his soul, his cracked heart. Searching for her. 

Fight it, he willed her, sending the words down the bond--the mating 
bond, which perhaps had settled into place that first moment they'd become 
carranam, hidden beneath flame and ice and hope for a better future. Fight 
her. I am coming for you. Even if it takes me a thousand years. I will find 
you, I will find you, I will find you. 

Only salt and wind and water answered him. 

Rowan rose to his feet. And slowly turned to face them. 

But their attention snagged on the ships now sailing out of the west-- 
from the battle site. His cousins' ships, with what remained of the fleet 
Ansel of Briarcliff had won for them, and Rolfe's three ships. 

But it was not those boats that made him pause. 

It was the one that rounded the eastern tip of the land--a longboat. It 
swept closer on a phantom wind, too fast to be natural. 

Rowan braced himself. The boat's shape didn't belong to any of the 
fleets assembled. But its style nagged at his memory. 

From their own fleet, Ansel of Briarcliff and Enda were soaring over the 
waves in a longboat, aiming for this beach. 

But Rowan and the others watched in silence as the foreign boat crested 
through the surf and slid onto the sand. 

Watched the olive-skinned sailors haul it up the beach. A broad- 
shouldered young man nimbly leaped out, his slightly curling dark hair 
tossed in the sea breeze. 

He did not emit a whiff of fear as he stalked for them--didn't even go 
for the comforting touch of the fine sword at his side. 

"Where is Aelin Galathynius?" the stranger asked a bit breathlessly as 
he scanned them. 

And his accent ... 

"Who are you," Rowan ground out. 

But the young man was now close enough that Rowan could see the 
color of his eyes. Turquoise--with a core of gold. 


Aedion breathed as if in a trance, "Galan." 

Galan Ashryver, Crown Prince of Wendlyn. 

The young man's eyes widened as he took in the warrior-prince. 
""Aedion," he said hoarsely, something like awe and grief in his face. But he 
blinked it away, self-assured and steady, and again asked, "Where is she?" 

None of them answered. Aedion demanded, "What are you doing 
here?" 

Galan's dark brows flicked toward each other. "I thought she would 
have informed you." 

"Informed us of what?" Rowan said too quietly. 

Galan reached into the pocket of his worn blue tunic, pulling out a 
crinkled letter that looked like it had been read a hundred times. He silently 
handed it to Rowan. 

Her scent still clung to it as he unfolded the paper, Aedion reading over 
his shoulder. 

Aelin's letter to the Prince of Wendlyn had been short. Brutal. The large 
letters were sprawled across the page as if her temper had gotten the better 
of her: 


TERRASEN REMEMBERS EVALIN ASHRYVER. 
DO YOU? 

I FOUGHT AT MISTWARD FOR YOUR PEOPLE. 
RETURN THE GODS-DAMNED FAVOR. 


And then coordinates--for this spot. 

"It only went to me," Galan said softly. "Not to my father. Only to me." 

To the armada that Galan controlled--as a blockade runner against 
Adarlan. 

"Rowan," Lysandra murmured in warning. He followed her stare. 

Not to where Ansel and Enda now arrived at the edge of their group, 
giving the Thirteen a wide berth as they lifted their brows at Galan. 

But to the small company of white-clad people that appeared on the 
cresting dunes behind them, splattered in mud and looking like they had 
trekked across the marshes themselves. 

And Rowan knew. 

He knew who they were before they even reached the beach. 


Ansel of Briarcliff had gone pale at the sight of their layered, flowing 
clothes. And as the tall male in their center peeled off his hood to reveal a 
brown-skinned, green-eyed face still handsome with youth, the Queen of 
the Wastes whispered, "Ilias." 

Ilias, son of the Mute Master of the Silent Assassins, gaped at Ansel, his 
back stiffening. But Rowan stepped toward the man, drawing his attention. 
Ilias's eyes narrowed in assessment. And he, like Galan, scanned them all, 
searching for a golden-haired woman who was not there. His eyes returned 
to Rowan as if he'd marked him as the axis of this group. 

In a voice hoarse from disuse, Ilias asked him, "We have come to fulfill 
our life debt to Celaena Sardothien--to Aelin Galathynius. Where is she?" 

"You are the sessiz suikast," Dorian said, shaking his head. "The Silent 
Assassins of the Red Desert." 

Ilias nodded. And glanced at Ansel, who still seemed near vomiting, 
before saying to Rowan, "It seems my friend has called in many debts in 
addition to ours." 

As if the words themselves were a signal, more white-clad figures filled 
the dunes behind them. 

Dozens. Hundreds. 

Rowan wondered if every single assassin from that desert Keep had 
come to honor their debt to the young woman. A lethal legion in 
themselves. 

And Galan ... 

Rowan turned to the Crown Prince of Wendlyn. "How many," he asked. 
"How many did you bring?" 

Galan only smiled a bit and pointed to the eastern horizon. 

Where white sails now broke over its rim. Ship after ship after ship, 
each bearing the cobalt flag of Wendlyn. 

"Tell Aelin Galathynius that Wendlyn has never forgotten Evalin 
Ashryver," Galan said to him, to Aedion. "Or Terrasen." 

Aedion fell to his knees in the sand as Wendlyn's armada spread before 
them. 

I promise you that no matter how far I go, no matter the cost, when you 
call for my aid, I will come, Aelin had told him she'd sworn to Darrow. I'm 
going to call in old debts and promises. To raise an army of assassins and 
thieves and exiles and commoners. 


And she had. She had meant and accomplished every word of it. 

Rowan counted the ships that slid over the horizon. Counted the ships in 
their own armada. Added Rolfe's--and the Mycenians he was rallying in 
the North. 

"Holy gods," Dorian breathed as Wendlyn's armada kept spreading 
wider and wider. 

Tears slid down Aedion's face as he silently sobbed. Where are our 
allies, Aelin? Where are our armies? She had taken the criticism--taken it, 
because he knew she hadn't wanted to disappoint them if she failed. Rowan 
put a hand on Aedion's shoulder. 

All of it for Terrasen, she had said that day she'd revealed she'd 
schemed her way into getting Arobynn's fortune. And Rowan knew that 
every step she had taken, every plan and calculation, every secret and 
desperate gamble ... 

For Terrasen. For them. For a better world. 

Aelin Galathynius had raised an army not just to challenge Morath ... 
but to rattle the stars. 

She'd known that she would not get to lead it. But she would still hold 
true to her promise to Darrow: I promise you on my blood, on my family's 
name, that I will not turn my back on Terrasen as you have turned your 
back on me. 

And the last piece of it ... if Chaol Westfall and Nesryn Faliq could 
rally forces from the southern continent ... 

Aedion at last looked up at him, eyes wide as he came to the same 
realization. 

A chance. His wife, his mate, had bought them a fool's shot at this war. 

And she did not believe that they would come for her. 

"Galan?" 

Rowan went still as death at the voice that floated over the dunes. At the 
golden-haired woman who wore the skin of his beloved. 

Aedion shot to his feet, about to snarl, when Rowan gripped his arm. 

When Lysandra, as Aelin, as she had promised, swept for them, 
grinning wide. 

That smile ... It punched a hole through his heart. Lysandra had taught 
herself Aelin's smile, that bit of wickedness and delight, honed with that 
razor edge of cruelty. 


Lysandra's acting, honed in the same hellhole Aelin had learned hers, 
was flawless as she spoke to Galan. As she spoke to Ilias, embracing him 
like a long-lost friend, and a relieved ally. 

Aedion was trembling beside him. But the world could not know. 

Their allies, their enemies, could not know that the immortal fire of 
Mala had been stolen. Leashed. 

Galan said to the one whom he believed to be his cousin, "Where now?" 

Lysandra looked to him, then to Aedion, not a sign of regret or guilt or 
doubt on her face. "We go north. To Terrasen." 

Rowan's stomach turned leaden. But Lysandra caught his eye, and said 
steadily and casually, "Prince--I need you to retrieve something for me 
before you join us in the North." 

Find her, find her, find her, the shifter seemed to beg. 

Rowan nodded, at a loss for words. Lysandra took his hand, squeezed it 
once in thanks, a polite, public farewell between a queen and her consort, 
and stepped away. 

"Come," Lysandra said to Galan and Ilias, motioning them toward 
where a white-faced Ansel and frowning Enda waited. "We have matters to 
discuss before we head out." 

Then their little company was alone once more. 

Aedion's hands clenched and unclenched at his sides as he gazed after 
the shape-shifter wearing Aelin's skin, leading their allies down the beach. 
To give them privacy. 

An army to take on Morath. To give them a fighting chance ... 

Sand whispered behind him as Lorcan stepped up to his side. "I will go 
with you. I will help you get her back." 

Gavriel rasped, "We'll find her." Aedion at last looked away from 
Lysandra at that. But he said nothing to his father--had said nothing to him 
at all since they'd landed on the beach. 

Elide took a limping step closer, her voice as raw as Gavriel's. 
"Together. We'll go together." 

Lorcan gave the Lady of Perranth an assessing look that she made a 
point to ignore. His eyes flickered as he said to Rowan, "Fenrys is with her. 
He'll know we're coming for her--try to leave tracks if he can." 

If Maeve didn't have him on lockdown. But Fenrys had battled the 
blood oath every day since swearing it. And if he was all that now stood 





between Cairn and Aelin ... Rowan didn't let himself think about Cairn. 
About what Maeve had already had him do, or would do to her before the 
end. No--Fenrys would fight it. And Aelin would fight it. 

Aelin would never stop fighting. 

Rowan faced Aedion, and the warrior-prince again peeled his attention 
away from Lysandra long enough to meet his eyes. Aedion understood the 
look, and put a hand on the Sword of Orynth's hilt. "Pll go north. With-- 
her. To oversee the armies, make sure it's all in place." 

Rowan clasped Aedion's forearm. "The lines have to hold. Buy us 
whatever time you can, brother." 

Aedion gripped his forearm in return, eyes burning bright. Rowan knew 
how much it killed him. But if the world believed Aelin was returning 
north, then one of her generals had to be at her side to lead her armies. And 
since Aedion commanded the loyalty of the Bane ... "Bring her back, 
Prince," Aedion said, voice cracking. "Bring her home." 

Rowan held his brother's stare and nodded. "We will see you again. All 
of you." 

He did not waste words persuading the warrior-prince to forgive the 
shifter. He wasn't entirely sure what to even make of Aelin and Lysandra's 
plan. What his role would have been in it. 

Dorian stepped forward, but glanced to Manon, who was staring toward 
the sea as if she could see wherever Maeve had spirited away her ship. 
Using that cloaking power she'd wielded to hide Fenrys and Gavriel in 
Skull's Bay--hide her armada from the eyes of Eyllwe. "The witches fly 
north," Dorian said. "And I will go with them. To see if I can do what needs 
to be done." 

"Stay with us," Rowan offered. "We'll find a way to deal with the keys 
and the Lock and the gods--all of it." 

Dorian shook his head. "If you go after Maeve, the keys should be kept 
far away. If I can help by doing this, by finding the third ... I will serve you 
better that way." 

"You'll likely die," Aedion cut in sharply. "We go north to bloodshed 
and killing fields--you head into dangers far worse than that. Morath will 
be waiting." Rowan cut him a glare. But his brother was beyond caring. No, 
Aedion was riding a vicious, vulnerable edge right now--and it wouldn't 





take much for that edge to turn lethal. Especially when Dorian had played 
his part in separating Aelin from their group. 

Dorian again looked to Manon, who now smiled faintly at him. It was a 
smile that softened her face, made it come alive. "He won't die if I can help 
it,' the witch said, then surveyed them all. "We journey to find the 
Crochans--to rally what forces they might have." 

A witch army to counter the Ironteeth legions. 

Hope--precious, fragile hope--stirred Rowan's blood. 

Manon merely jerked her chin in farewell and prowled up the bluff to 
her coven. 

So Rowan nodded to Dorian. But the man bowed his head--not the 
gesture of a friend to a friend. But of one king to another. 

Consort, he wanted to say. He was just her consort. 

Even if she'd married him so he could have the legal right to save 
Terrasen and rebuild it. To command the armies she'd given everything to 
gather for them. 

"When we are done, I will join you in Terrasen, Aedion," the King of 
Adarlan promised. "So that when you get back, Rowan--when both of you 
get back--there will be something left to fight for." 

Aedion seemed to consider. To weigh the man's words and expression. 
And then the general-prince stepped forward and embraced the king. It was 
quick, and hard, and Dorian flinched, but that edge in Aedion's grief-dull 
eyes had been eased a bit. Silently, Aedion glanced at Damaris, sheathed at 
Dorian's side. The blade of Adarlan's first and greatest king. Aedion 
seemed to weigh its presence, who bore it. At last, the general-prince 
nodded, more to himself than anyone. But Dorian still bowed his head in 
thanks. 

When Aedion had stalked toward the longboats, deliberately stepping 
around Lysandra-Aelin when she tried to speak to him, Rowan said to the 
king, "You trust the witches?" 

A nod. "They're leaving two wyverns to guard your ship to the edge of 
the continent. From there, they'll join us again--and you'll set off wherever 
... wherever you need to go." 

Maeve could have taken her anywhere, vanished that ship halfway 
across the world. 

Rowan said to Dorian, "Thank you." 


"Don't thank me." A half smile. "Thank Manon." 

If they all lived through this, if he got Aelin back, he would. 

He embraced Dorian, wished the king well, and watched the man climb 
up the sandbank to the white-haired witch who waited for him. 

Lysandra was already giving orders to Galan and Ilias regarding 
transporting the two hundred Silent Assassins onto Wendlyn's ships, 
Aedion monitoring with crossed arms. Ansel was deep in conversation with 
Endymion, who didn't seem to quite know what to do with the red-haired 
queen with a wolf's smile. Ansel, however, seemed already inclined to raise 
hell and have a damn good time doing it. Rowan wished he had more than a 
moment to spare to thank them both--to thank Enda and each one of his 
cousins. 

All was set, all was ready for that desperate push north. As Aelin had 
planned. 

There would be no rest, no waiting. They did not have the time to spare. 

The wyverns stirred, flapping their wings. Dorian climbed into the 
saddle behind Manon and wrapped his arms around her waist. The witch 
said something that made him smile. Truly smile. 

Dorian lifted his hand in farewell, wincing as Abraxos soared into the 
skies. 

Ten other wyverns took to the air behind them. 

The grinning, golden-haired witch--Asterin--and a slender, black- 
haired, green-eyed one named Briar waited atop their mounts for Gavriel, 
Lorcan, and Elide. To carry them to the ship that would take them hunting 
across the sea. 

Lorcan made to step toward Elide as she approached Asterin's wyvern, 
but she ignored him. Didn't even look at the male as she took Asterin's 
hand and was hauled up into the saddle. And though Lorcan hid it well, 
Rowan caught the glimmer of devastation on those centuries-hardened 
features. 

Gavriel's barked curse as he gripped the golden-haired witch's waist 
was the only sound of his unease as they flapped into the sky. Only when 
they were all airborne did Rowan slowly walk up the sandy hill, tying 
Goldryn's ancient scabbard to his knife belt as he went. 

Her blood-splattered shirt was still lying there, just to the side of the 
pool of her blood soaking the sand. He had no doubt Cairn had purposely 


left it. 

Rowan bent, picking up the shirt, running his thumbs over the soft 
fabric. 

The coven faded into the horizon; his companions reached their ship, 
and the others were readying to move the army his mate had summoned for 
them, pushing the longboats into the surf. 

Rowan brought the shirt to his face and breathed in her scent. Felt 
something stir in him--felt the bond flicker. 

He let the shirt drop, let the wind carry it far out to sea, far away from 
this blood-drenched place that reeked of pain. 

I will find you. 

Rowan shifted and soared high on a fast, wicked wind of his own 
making, the glimmering sea sprawling to his right, the marshes a green-and- 
gray tangle to his left. Chaining the wind to him, swiftly catching up with 
his companions now flying down the coast, he committed her scent to 
memory, committed that flicker in the bond to memory. 

That flicker he could have sworn he felt in answer, like the fluttering 
heart of an ember. 

Unleashing a cry that set the world trembling, Prince Rowan Whitethorn 
Galathynius, Consort of the Queen of Terrasen, began the hunt to find his 
wife.
