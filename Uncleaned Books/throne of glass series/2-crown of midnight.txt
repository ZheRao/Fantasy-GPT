CROWN OF MIDNIGHT 

Chapter 1 


The shutters swinging in the storm winds were the only sign of her entry. No 
one had noticed her scaling the garden wall of the darkened manor house, and 
with the thunder and the gusting wind off the nearby sea, no one heard her as 
she shimmied up the drainpipe, swung onto the windowsill, and slithered into 
the second-floor hallway. 

The King's Champion pressed herself into an alcove at the thud of 
approaching steps. Concealed beneath a black mask and hood, she willed 
herself to melt into the shadows, to become nothing more than a slip of 
darkness. A servant girl trudged past to the open window, grumbling as she 
latched it shut. Seconds later, she disappeared down the stairwell at the other 
end of the hall. The girl hadn't noticed the wet footprints on the floorboards. 

Lightning flashed, illuminating the hallway. The assassin took a long 
breath, going over the plans she'd painstakingly memorized in the three days 
she'd been watching the manor house on the outskirts of Bellhaven. Five 
doors on each side. Lord Nirall's bedroom was the third on the left. 

She listened for the approach of any other servants, but the house 
remained hushed as the storm raged around them. 

Silent and smooth as a wraith, she moved down the hall. Lord Nirall's 
bedroom door swung open with a slight groan. She waited until the next 
rumble of thunder before easing the door shut behind her. 

Another flash of lightning illuminated two figures sleeping in the four- 
poster bed. Lord Nirall was no older than thirty-five, and his wife, dark 
haired and beautiful, slept soundly in his arms. What had they done to off end 
the king so gravely that he wanted them dead? 

She crept to the edge of the bed. It wasn't her place to ask questions. Her 
job was to obey. Her freedom depended on it. With each step toward Lord 
Nirall, she ran through the plan again. 

Her sword slid out of its sheath with barely a whine. She took a 
shuddering breath, bracing herself for what would come next. 

Lord Nirall's eyes flew open just as the King's Champion raised her 
sword over his head. 


Chapter 2 


Celaena Sardothien stalked down the halls of the glass castle of Rifthold. 
The heavy sack clenched in her hand swung with each step, banging every so 
often into her knees. Despite the hooded black cloak that concealed much of 
her face, the guards didn't stop her as she strode toward the King of 
Adarlan's council chamber. They knew very well who she was--and what 
she did for the king. As the King's Champion, she outranked them. Actually, 
there were few in the castle she didn't outrank now. And fewer still who 
didn't fear her. 

She approached the open glass doors, her cloak sweeping behind her. The 
guards posted on either side straightened as she gave them a nod before 
entering the council chamber. Her black boots were nearly silent against the 
red marble floor. 

On the glass throne in the center of the room sat the King of Adarlan, his 
dark gaze locked on the sack dangling from her fingers. Just as she had the 
last three times, Celaena dropped to one knee before his throne and bowed 
her head. 

Dorian Havilliard stood beside his father's throne--and she could feel his 
sapphire eyes fixed on her. At the foot of the dais, always between her and 
the royal family, stood Chaol Westfall, Captain of the Guard. She looked up 
at him from the shadows of her hood, taking in the lines of his face. For all 
the expression he showed, she might as well have been a stranger. But that 
was expected, and it was just part of the game they'd become so skilled at 
playing these past few months. Chaol might be her friend, might be someone 
she'd somehow come to trust, but he was still captain--still responsible for 
the royal lives in this room above all others. The king spoke. 

"Rise." 

Celaena kept her chin high as she stood and pulled off her hood. 

The king waved a hand at her, the obsidian ring on his finger gleaming in 
the afternoon light. "Is it done?" 

Celaena reached a gloved hand into the sack and tossed the severed head 
toward him. No one spoke as it bounced, a vulgar thudding of stiff and rotting 


flesh on marble. It rolled to a stop at the foot of the dais, milky eyes turned 
toward the ornate glass chandelier overhead. 

Dorian straightened, glancing away from the head. Chaol just stared at her. 

"He put up a fight," Celaena said. 

The king leaned forward, examining the mauled face and the jagged cuts in 
the neck. "I can barely recognize him." 

Celaena gave hima crooked smile, though her throat tightened. "I'm afraid 
severed heads don't travel well." She fished in her sack again, pulling out a 
hand. "Here's his seal ring." She tried not to focus too much on the decaying 
flesh she held, the reek that had worsened with each passing day. She 
extended the hand to Chaol, whose bronze eyes were distant as he took it 
from her and offered it to the king. The king's lip curled, but he pried the ring 
off the stiff finger. He tossed the hand at her feet as he examined the ring. 

Beside his father, Dorian shifted. When she'd been dueling in the 
competition, he hadn't seemed to mind her history. What did he expect would 
happen when she became the King's Champion? Though she supposed 
severed limbs and heads would turn the stomachs of most people--even after 
living for a decade under Adarlan's rule. And Dorian, who had never seen 
battle, never witnessed the chained lines shuffling their way to the butchering 
blocks ... Perhaps she should be impressed he hadn't vomited yet. 

"What of his wife?" the king demanded, turning the ring over in his fingers 
again and again. 

"Chained to what's left of her husband at the bottom of the sea," Celaena 
replied with a wicked grin, and removed the slender, pale hand from her 
sack. It bore a golden wedding band, engraved with the date of the marriage. 
She offered it to the king, but he shook his head. She didn't dare look at 
Dorian or Chaol as she put the woman's hand back in the thick canvas sack. 

"Very well, then," the king murmured. She remained still as his eyes roved 
over her, the sack, the head. After a too-long moment, he spoke again. "There 
is a growing rebel movement here in Rifthold, a group of individuals who 
are willing to do anything to get me off the throne--and who are attempting to 
interfere with my plans. Your next assignment is to root out and dispatch them 
all before they become a true threat to my empire." 

Celaena clenched the sack so tightly her fingers ached. Chaol and Dorian 
were staring at the king now, as if this were the first they were hearing of 
this, too. 


She'd heard whispers of rebel forces before she'd gone to Endovier-- 
she'd met fallen rebels in the salt mines. But to have an actual movement 
growing in the heart of the capital; to have her be the one to dispatch them 
one by one ... And plans--what plans? What did the rebels know of the 
king's maneuverings? She shoved the questions down, down, down, until 
there was no possibility of his reading them on her face. 

The king drummed his fingers on the arm of the throne, still playing with 
Nirall's ring in his other hand. "There are several people on my list of 
suspected traitors, but I will only give you one name at a time. This castle is 
crawling with spies." 

Chaol stiffened at that, but the king waved his hand and the captain 
approached her, his face still blank as he extended a piece of paper to 
Celaena. 

She avoided the urge to stare at Chaol's face as he gave her the letter, 
though his gloved fingers grazed hers before he let go. Keeping her features 
neutral, she looked at the paper. On it was a single name: Archer Finn. 

It took every ounce of will and sense of self-preservation to keep her 
shock from showing. She knew Archer--had known him since she was 
thirteen and he'd come for lessons at the Assassins' Keep. He'd been several 
years older, already a highly sought-after courtesan ... who was in need of 
some training on how to protect himself from his rather jealous clients. And 
their husbands. 

He'd never minded her ridiculous girlhood crush on him. In fact, he'd let 
her test out flirting with him, and had usually turned her into a complete 
giggling mess. Of course, she hadn't seen him for several years--since 
before she went to Endovier--but she'd never thought him capable of 
something like this. He'd been handsome and kind and jovial, not a traitor to 
the crown so dangerous that the king would want him dead. 

It was absurd. Whoever was giving the king his information was a damned 
idiot. 

"Just him, or all his clients, too?" Celaena blurted. 

The king gave her a slow smile. "You know Archer? I'm not surprised." A 
taunt--a challenge. 

She just stared ahead, willing herself to calm, to breathe. "I used to. He's 
an extraordinarily well-guarded man. I'I] need time to get past his defenses." 
So carefully said, so casually phrased. What she really needed time for was 


to figure out how Archer had gotten tangled up in this mess--and whether the 
king was telling the truth. If Archer truly were a traitor and a rebel ... well, 
she'd figure that out later. 

"Then you have one month," the king said. "And if he's not buried by then, 
perhaps I shall reconsider your position, girl." 

She nodded, submissive, yielding, gracious. "Thank you, Your Majesty." 

"When you have dispatched Archer, I will give you the next name on the 
list." 

She had avoided the politics of the kingdoms--especially their rebel 
forces--for so many years, and now she was in the thick of it. Wonderful. 

"Be quick," the king warned. "Be discreet. Your payment for Nirall is 
already in your chambers." 

Celaena nodded again and shoved the piece of paper into her pocket. 

The king was staring at her. Celaena looked away but forced a corner of 
her mouth to twitch upward, to make her eyes glitter with the thrill of the 
hunt. At last, the king lifted his gaze to the ceiling. "Take that head and be 
gone." He pocketed Nirall's seal ring, and Celaena swallowed her twinge of 
disgust. A trophy. 

She scooped up the head by its dark hair and grabbed the severed hand, 
stuffing them into the sack. With only a glance at Dorian, whose face had 
gone pale, she turned on her heel and left. 


Dorian Havilliard stood in silence as the servants rearranged the chamber, 
dragging the giant oak table and ornate chairs into the center of the room. 
They had a council meeting in three minutes. He hardly heard as Chaol took 
his leave, saying he'd like to debrief Celaena further. His father grunted his 
approval. 

Celaena had killed a man and his wife. And his father had ordered it. 
Dorian had barely been able to look at either of them. He thought he'd been 
able to convince his father to reevaluate his brutal policies after the massacre 
of those rebels in Eyllwe before Yulemas, but it seemed like it hadn't made 
any difference. And Celaena ... 

As soon as the servants finished arranging the table, Dorian slid into his 
usual seat at his father's right. The councilmen began trickling in, along with 


Duke Perrington, who went straight to the king and began murmuring to him, 
too soft for Dorian to hear. 

Dorian didn't bother saying anything to anyone and just stared at the glass 
pitcher of water before him. Celaena hadn't seemed like herself just now. 

Actually, for the two months since she'd been named the King's 
Champion, she'd been like this. Her lovely dresses and ornate clothes were 
gone, replaced by an unforgiving, close-cut black tunic and pants, her hair 
pulled back in a long braid that fell into the folds of that dark cloak she was 
always wearing. She was a beautiful wraith--and when she looked at him, it 
was like she didn't even know who he was. 

Dorian glanced at the open doorway, through which she had vanished 
moments before. 

If she could kill people like this, then manipulating him into believing she 
felt something for him would have been all too easy. Making an ally of him-- 
making him /ove her enough to face his father on her behalf, to ensure that she 
was appointed Champion ... 

Dorian couldn't bring himself to finish the thought. He'd visit her-- 
tomorrow, perhaps. Just to see if there was a chance he was wrong. 

But he couldn't help wondering if he'd ever meant anything to Celaena at 
all. 


Celaena strode quickly and quietly down hallways and stairwells, taking the 
now-familiar route to the castle sewer. It was the same waterway that flowed 
past her secret tunnel, though here it smelled far worse, thanks to the servants 
depositing refuse almost hourly. 

Her steps, then a second pair--Chaol's--echoed in the long subterranean 
passage. But she didn't say anything until she stopped at the edge of the 
water, glancing at the several archways that opened on either side of the 
river. No one was here. 

"So," she said without looking behind her, "are you going to say hello, or 
are you just going to follow me everywhere?" She turned to face him, the 
sack still dangling from her hand. 

"Are you still acting like the King's Champion, or are you back to being 
Celaena?" In the torchlight, his bronze eyes glittered. 


Of course Chaol would notice the difference; he noticed everything. She 
couldn't tell whether it pleased her or not. Especially when there was a 
slight bite to his words. 

When she didn't reply, he asked, "How was Bellhaven?" 

"The same as it always is." She knew precisely what he meant; he wanted 
to know how her mission had gone. 

"He fought you?" He jerked his chin toward the sack in her hand. 

She shrugged and turned back to the dark river. "It was nothing I couldn't 
handle." She tossed the sack into the sewer. They watched in silence as it 
bobbed, then slowly sank. 

Chaol cleared his throat. She knew he hated this. When she'd gone on her 
first mission--to an estate up the coast in Meah--he'd paced so much before 
she left that she honestly thought he would ask her not to go. And when she'd 
returned, severed head in tow and rumors flying about Sir Carlin's murder, it 
had taken a week for him to even look her in the eye. But what had he 
expected? 

"When will you begin your new mission?" he asked. 

"Tomorrow. Or the day after. I need to rest," she added quickly when he 
frowned. "And besides, itll only take me a day or two to figure out how 
guarded Archer is and sort out my approach. Hopefully I won't even need the 
month the king gave me." And hopefully Archer would have some answers 
about how he'd gotten on the king's list, and what plans, exactly, that the king 
had alluded to. Then she would figure out what to do with him. 

Chaol stepped beside her, still staring at the filthy water, where the sack 
was undoubtedly now caught in the current and drifting out into the Avery 
River and the sea beyond. "I'd like to debrief you." 

She raised an eyebrow. "Aren't you at least going to take me to dinner 
first?" His eyes narrowed, and she gave him a pout. 

"Tt's not a joke. I want the details of what happened with Nirall." 

She brushed him aside with a grin, wiping her gloves on her pants before 
heading back up the stairs. 

Chaol grabbed her arm. "If Nirall fought back, then there might be 
witnesses who heard--" 

"He didn't make any noise," Celaena snapped, shaking him off as she 
stormed up the steps. After two weeks of travel, she just wanted to sleep. 


Even the walk up to her rooms felt like a trek. "You don't need to debrief me, 
Chaol." 

He stopped her again at a shadowy landing with a firm hand on her 
shoulder. "When you go away," he said, the distant torchlight illuminating the 
rugged planes of his face, "I have no idea what's happening to you. I don't 
know if you're hurt or rotting in a gutter somewhere. Yesterday I heard a 
rumor that they caught the killer responsible for Nirall's death." He brought 
his face close to hers, his voice hoarse. "Until you arrived today, I thought 
they meant you. I was about to go down there myself to find you." 

Well, that would explain why she'd seen Chaol's horse being saddled at 
the stables when she arrived. She loosed a breath, her face suddenly warm. 
"Have a little more faith in me than that. I am the King's Champion, after all." 

She didn't have time to brace herself as he pulled her against him, his 
arms wrapping tightly around her. 

She didn't hesitate before twining her arms over his shoulders, breathing 
in the scent of him. He hadn't held her since the day she'd learned she had 
officially won the competition, though the memory of that embrace often 
drifted into her thoughts. And as she held him now, the craving for it never to 
stop roared through her. 

His nose grazed the nape of her neck. "Gods above, you smell horrible," 
he muttered. 

She hissed and shoved him, her face burning in earnest now. "Carrying 
around dead body parts for weeks isn't exactly conducive to smelling nice! 
And maybe if d been given time for a bath instead of being ordered to 
report immediately to the king, I might have--" She stopped herself at the 
sight of his grin and smacked his shoulder. "Idiot." Celaena linked arms with 
him, tugging him up the stairs. "Come on. Let's go to my rooms so you can 
debrief me like a proper gentleman." 

Chaol snorted and nudged her with his elbow but didn't let go. 


After a joyous Fleetfoot calmed down enough for Celaena to speak without 
being licked, Chaol squeezed every last detail from her and left her with the 
promise to return for dinner in a few hours. And after she let Philippa fuss 
over her in the bath and bemoan the state of her hair and nails, Celaena 
collapsed onto her bed. 


Fleetfoot leapt up beside her, curling in close to her side. Stroking the 
dog's silky golden coat, Celaena stared at the ceiling, the exhaustion seeping 
out of her sore muscles. 

The king had believed her. 

And Chaol hadn't once doubted her story as he inquired about her 
mission. She couldn't quite decide if that made her feel smug, disappointed, 
or outright guilty. But the lies had rolled off her tongue. Nirall awoke right 
before she killed him, she had to slit his wife's throat to keep her from 
screaming, and the fight was a tad messier than she would have liked. She'd 
thrown in real details, too: the second-floor hall window, the storm, the 
servant with the candle ... The best lies were always mixed with truth. 

Celaena clutched the amulet on her chest. The Eye of Elena. She hadn't 
seen Elena since their last encounter in the tomb; hopefully, now that she was 
the King's Champion, the ancient queen's ghost would leave her alone. Still, 
in the months since Elena had given her the amulet for protection, Celaena 
had come to find its presence reassuring. The metal was always warm, as 
though it had a life of its own. 

She squeezed it hard. If the king knew the truth about what she did--what 
she'd been doing these past two months ... 

She had embarked on the first mission intending to quickly dispatch the 
target. She'd prepared herself for the kill, told herself that Sir Carlin was 
nothing but a stranger and his life meant nothing to her. But when she got to 
his estate and witnessed the unusual kindness with which he treated his 
servants, when she saw him playing the lyre with a traveling minstrel he 
sheltered in his hall, when she realized whose agenda she was aiding ... she 
couldn't do it. She tried to bully and coax and bribe herself into doing it. But 
she couldn't. 

Still, she had to produce a murder scene--and a body. 

She'd given Lord Nirall the same choice she'd given Sir Carlin: die right 
then, or fake his own death and flee--flee far, and never use his given name 
again. So far, of the four men she'd been assigned to dispatch, all had chosen 
escape. 

It wasn't hard to get them to part with their seal rings or other token items. 
And it was even easier to get them to hand over their mghtclothes so she 
could slash them in accordance with the wounds she would claim to have 
given them. Bodies were easy to acquire, too. 


Sick-houses were always dumping fresh corpses. It was never hard to find 
one that looked enough like her target--especially since the locations of the 
kills had been distant enough to give the flesh time to rot. 

She didn't know who the head of Lord Nirall actually belonged to--only 
that he had similar hair, and when she inflicted a few slashes on his face and 
let the whole thing decompose a bit, it did the job. The hand had also come 
from that corpse. And the lady's hand ... that had come from a young woman 
barely into her first bleeding, struck dead by a sickness that ten years ago a 
gifted healer could easily have cured. But with magic gone and those wise 
healers hanged or burned, people were dying in droves. Dying from stupid, 
once-curable illnesses. She rolled over to bury her face in Fleetfoot's soft 
coat. 

Archer. How was she going to fake his death? He was so popular, and so 
recognizable. She still couldn't imagine him having a connection to whatever 
this underground movement was. But if he was on the king's list, then perhaps 
in the years since she'd seen him Archer had used his talents to become 
powerful. 

Yet what information could the movement possibly have on the king's 
plans that would make it a true threat? The king had enslaved the entire 
continent--what more could he do? 

There were other continents, of course. Other continents with wealthy 
kingdoms--like Wendlyn, that faraway land across the sea. It had held out 
against his naval attacks so far, but she'd heard next to nothing about that war 
since before she'd gone to Endovier. 

And why would a rebel movement care about kingdoms on another 
continent when they had their own to worry about? So the plans had to be 
about this land, this continent. 

She didn't want to know. She didn't want to know what the king was 
doing, what he imagined for the empire. She'd use this month to figure out 
what to do with Archer and pretend she'd never heard that horrible word: 
plans. 

Celaena fought a shudder. She was playing a very, very lethal game. And 
now that her targets were people in Rifthold--now that it was Archer ... 
She'd have to find a way to play it better. Because if the king ever learned 
the truth, if he found out what she was doing ... 

He'd destroy her. 


Chapter 3 


Celaena sprinted through the darkness of the secret passageway, her 
breathing ragged. She glanced over her shoulder to find Cain grinning at her, 
his eyes like burning coals. 

No matter how fast she ran, his stalking gait easily kept him just behind 
her. After him flowed a wake of glowing green Wyrdmarks, their strange 
shapes and symbols illuminating the ancient blocks of stone. And behind 
Cain, its long nails scraping against the ground, lumbered the ridderak. 

Celaena stumbled, but remained upright. Each step felt like she was 
wading through mud. She couldn't escape him. He would catch her 
eventually. And once the ridderak got hold of her ... She didn't dare glance 
again at those too-big teeth that jutted out of its mouth or those fathomless 
eyes, gleaming with the desire to devour her bit by bit. 

Cain chuckled, the sound grating on the stone walls. He was close now. 
Close enough that his fingers raked against the nape of her neck. He 
whispered her name, her true name, and she screamed as he-- 


Celaena awoke with a gasp, clutching the Eye of Elena. She scanned the 
room for denser shadows, for glowing Wyrdmarks, for signs that the secret 
door was open behind the tapestry that concealed it. But there was only the 
crackling of the dying fire. 

Celaena sank back into her pillows. It was just a nightmare. Cain and the 
ridderak were gone, and Elena wouldn't bother her again. It was over. 

Fleetfoot, sleeping under the many layers of blankets, put her head on 
Celaena's stomach. Celaena nestled down farther, wrapping her arms around 
the dog as she closed her eyes. 

It was over. 


In the chill mists of early morning, Celaena hurled a stick across the wide 
field of the game park. Fleetfoot took off through the pale grass like a bolt of 
golden lightning, so fast that Celaena let out a low, appreciative whistle. 


Beside her, Nehemia clicked her tongue, her eyes on the swift hound. With 
Nehemia so busy winning over Queen Georgina and gleaning information 
about the king's plans for Eyllwe, dawn was usually the only time they could 
see each other. Did the king know that the princess was one of the spies he'd 
mentioned? He couldn't, or else he'd never trust Celaena to be his 
Champion, not when their friendship was widely known. 

"Why Archer Finn?" Nehemia mused in Eyllwe, keeping her voice low. 
Celaena had explained her latest mission, keeping the details brief. 

Fleetfoot reached the stick and trotted back to them, her long tail wagging. 
Even though she wasn't yet fully grown, the dog was already abnormally 
large. Dorian had never said what breed, exactly, he suspected her mother 
had mated with. Given Fleetfoot's size, it could have been a wolfhound. Or 
an actual wolf. 

Celaena shrugged at Nehemia's question, stuffing her hands into the fur- 
lined pockets of her cloak. "The king thinks ... he thinks that Archer is a part 
of some secret movement against him. A movement here in Rifthold to get 
him off the throne." 

"Surely no one would be that bold. The rebels hide out in the mountains 
and forests and places where the local people can conceal and support them 
--not here. Rifthold would be a death trap." 

Celaena shrugged again just as Fleetfoot returned and demanded the stick 
be thrown again. "Apparently not. And apparently the king has a list of 
people whom he thinks are key players in this movement against him." 

"And you're to ... kill them all?" Nehemia's creamy brown face paled 
slightly. 

"One by one," Celaena said, throwing the stick as far as she could into the 
misty field. Fleetfoot shot off, dried grass and the remnants of the last 
snowstorm crunching beneath her huge paws. "He'll only reveal one name at 
a time. A bit dramatic, if you ask me. But apparently they're interfering with 
his plans." 

"What plans?" Nehemia said sharply. 

Celaena frowned. "I was hoping you might know." 

"I don't." There was a tense pause. "If you learn anything ...," Nehemia 
began. 

"PII see what I can do," Celaena lied. She wasn't even sure if she truly 
wanted to know what the king was up to--let alone share that information 


with anyone else. It was selfish, and stupid, perhaps, but she couldn't forget 
the warning the king had given the day he crowned her Champion: if she 
stepped out of line, if she betrayed him, he'd kill Chaol. And then Nehemia, 
and then the princess's family. 

And all of this--every death she faked, every lie she told--put them at 
risk. 

Nehemia shook her head but didn't reply. Whenever the princess or Chaol 
or even Dorian looked at her like that, it was almost too much to bear. But 
they had to believe the lies, too. For their own safety. 

Nehemia began wringing her hands, and her eyes grew distant. Celaena 
had seen that expression often in the past month. "If you're fretting for my 
sake--" 

"Pm not," Nehemia said. "You can take care of yourself." 

"Then what is it?" Celaena's stomach clenched. If Nehemia talked more 
about the rebels, she didn't know how much of it she could take. Yes, she 
wanted to be free of the king--both as his Champion and as a child of a 
conquered nation--but she wanted nothing to do with whatever plots were 
brewing in Rifthold, and whatever desperate hope the rebels still savored. 
To stand against the king would be nothing but folly. They'd all be destroyed. 

But Nehemia said, "Numbers in the Calaculla labor camp are swelling. 
Every day, more and more Eyllwe rebels arrive. Most consider it a miracle 
that they're alive. After the soldiers butchered those five hundred rebels ... 
My people are afraid." Fleetfoot again returned, and it was Nehemia who 
took the stick from the dog's mouth and chucked it into the gray dawn. "But 
the conditions in Calaculla ..." 

She paused, probably recalling the three scars that raked down Celaena's 
back. A permanent reminder of the cruelty of the Salt Mines of Endovier-- 
and a reminder that even though she was free, thousands of people still toiled 
and died there. Calaculla, the sister camp to Endovier, was rumored to be 
even worse. 

"The king will not meet with me," Nehemia said, now toying with one of 
her fine, slender braids. "I have asked him three times to discuss the 
conditions in Calaculla, and each time he claims to be occupied. Apparently, 
he's too busy finding people for you to kill." 

Celaena blushed at the harshness in Nehemia's tone. Fleetfoot returned 
again, but when Nehemia took the stick, the princess kept it in her hands. 


"I must do something, Elentiya,' Nehemia said, using the name she'd 
given her on the night Celaena admitted that she was an assassin. "I must find 
a way to help my people. When does gathering information become a 
stalemate? When do we act?" 

Celaena swallowed hard. That word--"act'--scared her more than she'd 
like to admit. Worse than the word "plans." Fleetfoot sat at their feet, tail 
wagging as she waited for the stick to be thrown. 

But when Celaena said nothing, when she promised nothing, just as she 
always did when Nehemia spoke about these things, the princess dropped the 
stick on the ground and quietly walked back to the castle. 

Celaena waited until Nehemia's footsteps faded and let out a long breath. 
She was to meet Chaol for their morning run in a few minutes, but after that 

. after that, she was going into Rifthold. Let Archer wait until this 
afternoon. 

After all, the king had given her a month, and despite her own questions 
for Archer, she wanted to get off the castle grounds for a bit. She had blood 
money to burn. 


Chapter 4 


Chaol Westfall sprinted through the game park, Celaena keeping pace beside 
him. The chill morning air was like shards of glass in his lungs; his breath 
clouded in front of him. They'd bundled up as best they could without 
weighing themselves down--mostly just layers of shirts and gloves--but 
even with sweat running down his body, Chaol was freezing. 

Chaol knew Celaena was freezing, too--her nose was tipped with pink, 
color stood high on her cheeks, and her ears shone bright red. Noticing his 
stare, she flashed him a grin, those stunning turquoise eyes full of light. 
"Tired?" she teased. "I knew you weren't bothering to train while I was 
away." 

He let out a breathy chuckle. "You certainly didn't train while you were on 
your mission. This is the second time this morning that ve had to slow my 
pace for you." 

A blatant lie. She kept up with him easily now, nimble as a stag bounding 
through the woods. Sometimes he found it immensely hard not to watch her-- 
to watch the way she moved. 

"Keep telling yourself that," she said, and ran a little faster. 

He increased his speed, not wanting her to leave him behind. Servants had 
cleared a path through the snow blanketing the game park, but the ground was 
still icy and treacherous underfoot. 

He'd been realizing it more and more recently--how much he hated it 
when she left him behind. How he hated her setting off on those cursed 
missions and not contacting him for days or weeks. He didn't know how or 
when it had happened, but he'd somehow started caring whether she came 
back or not. And after all that they'd already endured together ... 

He'd killed Cain at the duel. Killed him to save her. Part of him didn't 
regret it; part of him would do it again in a heartbeat. But the other part still 
woke him up in the middle of the night, drenched in sweat that felt too much 
like Cain's blood. 

She looked over at him. "What's wrong?" 

He fought the rising guilt. "Keep your eyes on the path or you'! slip." 

For once, she obeyed him. "You want to talk about it?" 


Yes. No. If there were anyone who could understand the guilt and rage he 
grappled with when he thought about how he'd killed Cain, it would be her. 
"How often," he said in between breaths, "do you think about the people 
you ve killed?" 

She whipped her gaze to him, then slowed. He didn't feel like stopping, 
and might have kept running, but she grabbed his elbow and forced him to 
pause. Her lips formed a thin line. "If you think passing judgment on me 
before I've had breakfast is in any way a good idea--" 

"No," he interrupted, panting hard. "No--I didn't mean it like ..." He 
swallowed a few breaths. "I wasn't judging." If he could just get his damn 
breath back, he could explain what he'd meant. 

Her eyes were as frozen as the park around him, but then she tilted her 
head to the side. "Is this about Cain?" 

Hearing her speak the name made him clench his jaw, but he managed a 
nod. 

The ice in her eyes melted completely. He hated the sympathy in her face, 
the understanding. 

He was the Captain of the Guard--he was bound to have killed someone 
at some point. He'd already seen and done enough in the name of the king; 
he'd fought men, hurt them. So he shouldn't even be having these feelings, 
and especially shouldn't be telling Her. There was a line between them, 
somewhere, and he was fairly certain that he'd been toeing it more and more 
these days. 

"PIIL never forget the people I've killed," she said. Her breath curled in 
the air between them. "Even the ones I killed to survive. I still see their 
faces, still remember the exact blow it took to kill them." She looked to the 
skeletal trees. "Some days, it feels like another person did those things. And 
most of those lives I'm glad I ended. No matter the cause, though, it--it still 
takes away a little piece of you each time. So I don't think P11 ever forget 
them." 

Her gaze found his again, and he nodded. 

"But, Chaol," she said, and tightened her grip on his arm, a grip he hadn't 
realized she'd still been holding, "what happened with Cain--that wasn't an 
assassination, or even a cold-blooded murder." He tried to step back, but she 
held firm. "What you did wasn't dishonorable--and I'm not just saying that 
because it was my life you were saving." She paused for a long moment. 





"You will never forget killing Cain," she said at last, and when her eyes met 
his, his heart pounded so hard he could feel it across his whole body. "But I 
will never forget what you did to save me, either." 

The urge to lean into her warmth was staggering. He made himself step 
back, away from the grip of her hand, made himself nod again. There was a 
line between them. The king might not think twice about their friendship, but 
crossing that final line could be deadly for both of them; it could make the 
king question his loyalty, his position, everything. 

And if it ever came down to having to choose between his king and 
Celaena ... He prayed to the Wyrd that he'd never be faced with that 
decision. Staying firmly on this side of the line was the logical choice. The 
honorable one, too, since Dorian ... He'd seen the way Dorian still looked at 
her. He wouldn't betray his friend like that. 

"Well," Chaol said with forced lightness, "I suppose having Adarlan's 
Assassin in my debt could be useful." 

She gave hima bow. "At your service." 

His smile was genuine this time. 

"Come on, Captain," she said, starting into a slow jog. "I'm hungry, and I 
don't feel like freezing my ass off out here." 

He chuckled under his breath, and they ran on through the park. 


When they finished their run, Celaena's legs were wobbling, and her lungs 
were so raw from the cold and exertion that she thought they might be 
bleeding. They slowed to a brisk walk as they headed back to the toasty 
interior of the palace--and the giant breakfast that she was very much 
looking forward to devouring before going shopping. 

They entered the castle gardens, weaving their way through the gravel 
paths and towering hedges. She kept her hands tucked under her arms. Even 
with the gloves, her fingers were frozen stiff. And her ears positively ached. 
Perhaps she'd start wearing a scarf over her head--even if Chaol would 
tease her mercilessly about it. 

She glanced sideways at her companion, who had peeled off his outer 
layers of clothing to reveal the sweat-drenched shirt clinging to his body. 
They rounded a hedge, and Celaena rolled her eyes when she saw what 
waited on the path ahead. 


Every morning, more and more ladies found excuses to be walking 
through the gardens just after dawn. At first, it had just been a few young 
women who'd taken one look at Chaol and his sweaty, clingy clothes and 
halted their walk. Celaena could have sworn their eyes had bulged out of 
their heads and their tongues had rolled onto the ground. 

Then the next morning, they'd appeared along the path again--wearing 
even nicer dresses. The day after that, more girls showed up. And then 
several more. And now every direct route from the game park to the castle 
had at least one set of young women patrolling, waiting for him to walk by. 

"Oh, please," Celaena hissed as they passed two women, who looked up 
from their fur muffs to bat their eyelashes at him. They must have awoken 
before dawn to be dressed so finely. 

"What?" Chaol asked, his brows rising. 

She didn't know whether he simply didn't notice, or he didn't want to say 
anything, but ... "The gardens are rather busy for a winter morning," she said 
carefully. 

He shrugged. "Some people go a little stir-crazy being cooped up inside 
all winter." 

Or they just enjoy the sight of the Captain of the Guard and his muscles. 

But all she said was, "Right," and then shut her mouth. No need to point it 
out if he was that oblivious. Especially when some of the ladies were 
exceptionally pretty. 

"Are you going into Rifthold to spy on Archer today?" Chaol asked softly, 
when the path was mercifully clear of giggling, blushing girls. 

She nodded. "I want to get a sense of his schedule, so Pll probably trail 

"Why don't I help you?" 

"Because I don't need your help." She knew he'd probably interpret it as 
arrogance--and it partially was--but ... if he did get involved, then it would 
complicate things when it came time to smuggle Archer to safety. That is, 
after she got the truth out of him--and learned what plans the king had in 
mind. 

"I know you don't need my help. I just thought you might want ..." He 
trailed off, then shook his head, as if reprimanding himself. She found herself 
wanting to know what he'd been about to say, but it was best to let the topic 
drop. 


They rounded another hedge, the castle interior so close she almost 
groaned at the thought of that delicious warmth, but then-- 

"Chaol." Dorian's voice cut through the crisp morning. 

She did groan then, a barely audible sound. Chaol shot her a puzzled look 
before they turned to find Dorian striding toward them, a blond young man in 
tow. She'd never seen the youth, who was finely dressed and looked about 
Dorian's age, but Chaol stiffened. 

The young man didn't seem like a threat, though she knew better than to 
underestimate anyone in a court like this. He wore only a dagger at his waist, 
and his pale face seemed rather jovial, despite the winter morning chill. 

She found Dorian watching her with a half smile, an amused gleam in his 
eye that made her want to slap him. The prince then glanced at Chaol and 
chuckled. "And here I was, thinking that all the ladies were out so early for 
Roland and me. When all of them catch a vicious cold, P11 let their fathers 
know that you're to blame." 

Chaol's cheeks colored ever so slightly. So he wasn't as ignorant of their 
morning audience as he'd led her to believe. "Lord Roland," he said tightly 
to Dorian's friend, and bowed. 

The blond young man bowed back to Chaol. "Captain Westfall." His 
voice was pleasant enough, but something in it made her pause. It wasn't 
amusement or arrogance or anger ... She couldn't put her finger on it. 

"Allow me to introduce my cousin," Dorian said to her, clapping Roland 
on the shoulder. "Lord Roland Havilliard of Meah." He extended a hand to 
Celaena. "Roland, this is Lillian. She works for my father." 

They still used her alias whenever she couldn't avoid running into 
members of the court, though most everyone knew to some degree that she 
was not in the palace for administrative nonsense or politics. 

"My pleasure," Roland said, bowing at the waist. "Are you newly arrived 
to court? I don't think I've seen you in years past." 

Just the way he spoke told her enough about his history with women. "I 
arrived this autumn," she said a bit too quietly. 

Roland gave her a courtier's smile. "And what sort of work do you do for 
my uncle?" 

Dorian shifted on his feet and Chaol went very still, but Celaena returned 
Roland's smile and said, "I bury the king's opponents where nobody will 
ever find them." 


Roland, to her surprise, actually chuckled. She didn't dare look at Chaol, 
whom she was certain would give her a tongue-lashing for it later. "I'd heard 
about the King's Champion. I didn't think it would be someone so ... lovely." 

"What brings you to the castle, Roland?" the captain demanded. When 
Chaol looked at her like that, she usually found herself running in the other 
direction. 

Roland smiled again. He smiled too much--and too smoothly. "His 
Majesty has offered me a position on his council." Chaol's eyes snapped to 
Dorian, who gave a shrug of confirmation. "I arrived last mght, and I'm to 
start today." 

Chaol smiled--if you could call it that. It was more a flash of teeth. Yes, 
she'd most definitely be running if Chaol looked at her like that. 

Dorian understood the look, too, and gave a deliberate chuckle. But 
before the prince could speak, Roland studied Celaena further, a tad too 
intently. "Perhaps you and I shall get to work with each other, Lillian. Your 
position intrigues me." 

She wouldn't mind working with him--but not in the way Roland meant. 
Her way would include a dagger, a shovel, and an unmarked grave. 

As if he could read her thoughts, Chaol put a guiding hand on her back. 
"We're late for breakfast," he said, bowing his head to Dorian and Roland. 
"Congratulations on your appointment." He sounded like he'd swallowed 
rancid milk. 

As she let Chaol lead her inside the castle, she realized she was in 
desperate need of a bath. But it had nothing to do with her sweaty clothes, 
and everything to do with the oily grin and roaming eyes of Roland 
Havilliard. 


Dorian watched Celaena and Chaol disappear behind the hedges, the 
captain's hand still on the middle of her back. She did nothing to shake it off. 
"An unexpected choice for your father to make, even with that 
competition," Roland mused beside him. 
Dorian checked his irritation before replying. He'd never particularly 
liked his cousin, whom he'd seen at least twice a year while growing up. 
Chaol positively hated Roland, and whenever he came up in conversation, 
it was usually accompanied by phrases like "conniving wretch' and 


"sniveling, spoiled ass." At least, that's what Chaol had been roaring three 
years ago, after the captain had punched Roland so hard in the face that the 
youth blacked out. 

But Roland had deserved it. Deserved it enough that it hadn't interfered 
with Chaol's sterling reputation and later appointment to Captain of the 
Guard. If anything, it had improved Chaol's standing among the other guards 
and lesser nobles. 

If Dorian worked up the nerve, he'd ask his father what he'd been thinking 
when he appointed Roland to the council. Meah was a small yet prosperous 
coastal city in Adarlan, but it held no real political power. It didn't even 
have a standing army, save for the city's sentries. Roland was his father's 
cousin's son; perhaps the king felt that they needed more Havilliard blood in 
the council room. Still--Roland was untried, and had always seemed more 
interested in girls than politics. 

"Where did your father's Champion come from?" Roland asked, drawing 
Dorian's attention back to the present. 

Dorian turned toward the castle, heading for a different entrance than the 
one Chaol and Celaena had used. He still remembered the way they'd looked 
when he'd walked in on them embracing in her rooms after the duel, two 
months ago. 

"Lillian's story is hers to tell,' Dorian lied. He just didn't feel like 
explaining the competition to his cousin. It was bad enough that his father had 
ordered him to take Roland on a walk this morning. The only bright spot had 
been seeing Celaena so obviously contemplate ways to bury the young lord. 

"Is she for your father's personal use, or do the other councilmen also 
employ her?" 

"You've been here for less than a day, and you already have enemies to 
dispatch, cousin?" 

"We're Havilliards, cousin. We'll always have enemies that need 
dispatching." 

Dorian frowned. It was true, though. "Her contract is exclusively with my 
father. But if you feel threatened, then I can have Captain Westfall assign a 

"Oh, of course not. I was merely curious." 

Roland was a pain in the ass, and too aware of the effect his looks and his 
Havilliard name had on women, but he was harmless. Wasn't he? 


Dorian didn't know the answer--and he wasn't sure if he wanted to. 


Her salary as King's Champion was considerable, and Celaena spent every 
last copper of it. Shoes, hats, tunics, dresses, jewelry, weapons, baubles for 
her hair, and books. Books and books and books. So many books that 
Philippa had to bring up another bookcase for her room. 

When Celaena returned to her rooms that afternoon, lugging hat boxes, 
colorful bags full of perfume and sweets, and brown paper parcels with the 
books she absolutely had to read immediately, she nearly dropped it all at the 
sight of Dorian Havilliard sitting in her foyer. 

"Gods above," he said, taking in all of her purchases. 

He didn't know the half of it. This was just what she could carry. More 
had been ordered, and more would be delivered soon. 

"Well," he said as she dumped the bags on the table, nearly toppling into a 
heap of tissue paper and ribbons, "at least you're not wearing that dreadful 
black today." 

She shot him a glare over her shoulder as she straightened. Today she was 
wearing a lilac and ivory gown--a little bright for the end of winter, but 
worn in the hope that spring would soon come. Plus, dressing nicely 
guaranteed her the best service in whatever stores she visited. To her 
surprise, many of the shopkeepers remembered her from years ago--and had 
bought her lie about a long journey to the southern continent. 

"And to what do I owe this pleasure?" She untied her white fur cloak-- 
another gift to herself--and tossed it onto one of the chairs around the foyer 
table. "Didn't I already see you this morning in the garden?" 

Dorian remained seated, that familiar, boyish grin on his face. "Aren't 
friends allowed to visit each other more than once a day?" 

She stared down at him. Being friends with Dorian wasn't something she 
was certain she could actually do. Not when he would always have that 
gleam in his sapphire eyes--and not when he was the son of the man who 
gripped her fate in his hands. But in the two months since she'd ended 
whatever had been between them, she'd often found herself missing him. Not 
the kissing and flirting, but just him. 

"What do you want, Dorian?" 


A glimmer of ire flashed across his face, and he stood. She had to tip her 
head back to look at him. "You said you still wanted to be friends with me." 
His voice was low. 

She closed her eyes for a moment. "I meant it." 

"So be my friend," he said, his tone lifting. "Dine with me, play billiards 
with me. Tell me what books you're reading--or buying," he added with a 
wink in the direction of her parcels. 

"Oh?" she asked, forcing herself to give him a half smile. "And you have 
so much time on your hands these days that you can spend hours with me 
again?" 

"Well, I have my usual flock of ladies to attend to, but I can always make 
time for you." 

She batted her eyelashes at him. "I'm truly honored." Actually, the thought 
of Dorian with other women made her want to shatter a window, but it 
wouldn't be fair to let him know that. She glanced at the clock on the small 
table beside a wall. "I actually need to go back into Rifthold right now," she 
said. It wasn't a lie. She still had a few hours of daylight left--enough time 
to survey Archer's elegant townhouse and start trailing him to get a sense of 
his usual whereabouts. 

Dorian nodded, his smile fading. 

Silence fell, interrupted only by the ticking of the clock on the table. She 
crossed her arms, remembering how he'd smelled, how his lips had tasted. 
But this distance between them, this horrible gap that spread every day ... it 
was for the best. 

Dorian took a step closer, exposing his palms to her. "Do you want me to 
fight for you? Is that it?" 

"No," she said quietly. "I just want you to leave me alone." 

His eyes flickered with the words left unsaid. Celaena stared at him, 
unmoving, until he silently left. 

Alone in the foyer, Celaena clenched and unclenched her fists, suddenly 
disgusted with all of the pretty packages on the table. 


Chapter 5 


On a rooftop in a very fashionable and respectable part of Rifthold, Celaena 
crouched in the shadow of a chimney and frowned into the chill wind gusting 
off the Avery. She checked her pocket watch for the third time. Archer Finn's 
previous two appointments had only been an hour each. He'd been in the 
house across the street for almost two. 

There was nothing interesting about the elegant, green-roofed townhouse, 
and she hadn't learned anything about who lived there, other than the client's 
name--some Lady Balanchine. She had used the same trick she'd employed 
at the other two houses to gain that bit of information: she pretended to be a 
courier with a package for Lord So-and-So. And when the butler or 
housekeeper said that this was not Lord So-and-So's house, she'd feigned 
embarrassment, asked whose house it was, chatted up the servant a bit, and 
then went on her way. 

Celaena adjusted the position of her legs and rolled her neck. The sun had 
nearly set, the temperature dropping with each passing minute. Unless she 
could get into the houses themselves, she wasn't going to learn much else. 
And given the likelihood that Archer might actually be doing what he was 
paid to do, she was in no rush to go inside. Better to learn where he went, 
who he saw, and then take the next step. 

It had been so long since she'd done something like this in Rifthold-- 
since she'd crouched on the emerald rooftops and learned what she could 
about her prey. It was different than when the king had sent her off to 
Bellhaven or to some lord's estate. Here, now, in Rifthold, it felt like ... 

It felt like she'd never left. As if she might look over her shoulder and find 
Sam Cortland crouching behind her. As if she might return at the end of the 
night not to the glass castle, but to the Assassins' Keep on the other side of 
the city. 

Celaena sighed, tucking her hands under her arms to keep her fingers 
warm and agile. 

It had been over a year and a half since the night she'd lost her freedom; a 
year and a half since she'd lost Sam. And somewhere, in this city, were the 


answers to how it all had happened. If she dared to look, she knew she'd find 
them. And she knew it would destroy her again. 

The front door of the townhouse opened, and Archer swaggered down the 
steps, right into his waiting carriage. She barely caught a glimpse of his 
golden-brown hair and fine clothes before he was whisked away. 

Groaning, Celaena straightened from her crouch and hurried off the roof. 
Some harrowing climbing and a few jumps soon had her back on the cobbled 
Streets. 

She trailed Archer's carriage, slipping in and out of shadows as they 
made their way across the city, a slow journey thanks to traffic. While she 
might be in no hurry to seek out the truth behind her own capture and Sam's 
death, and while she was fairly certain the king had to be wrong about 
Archer, part of her wondered whether whatever truth she uncovered about 
this rebel movement and the king's plans would destroy her, too. 

And not just destroy her--but also everything she'd grown to care about. 


Savoring the warmth of the crackling fire, Celaena leaned her head against 
the back of the small couch and dangled her legs over the cushioned arm. The 
lines on the paper she held before her were beginning to blur, which was no 
surprise, given that it was well past eleven, and she'd been up before dawn. 

Sprawled on the well-worn red carpet in front of her, Chaol's glass pen 
flickered with firelight as he scanned through documents and signed things 
and scribbled notes. Giving a little sigh through her nose, Celaena lowered 
the paper in her hands. 

Unlike her spacious suite, Chaol's bedroom was one large chamber, 
furnished only with a table by the solitary window and the old couch set 
before the stone fireplace. A few tapestries hung on the gray stone walls, a 
towering oak armoire stood in one corner, and his four-poster bed was 
decorated with a rather old and faded crimson duvet. There was a bathing 
room attached--not as large as her own, but still spacious enough to 
accommodate its own pool and privy. He had only one small bookcase, filled 
and neatly arranged. In alphabetical order, if she knew Chaol at all. And it 
probably contained only his most beloved books--unlike Celaena's, which 
housed every title she got her hands on, whether she liked the book or not. 


Regardless of his unnaturally organized bookshelf, she liked it here; it was 
cozy. 

She'd started coming here a few weeks ago, when thoughts of Elena and 
Cain and the secret passageways made her itch to get out of her own rooms. 
And even though he'd grumbled about her imposing on his privacy, Chaol 
hadn't turned her away or objected to her frequent after-dinner visits. 

The scratching of Chaol's pen stopped. "Remind me again what you're 
working on." 

She flopped onto her back as she waved the paper in the air above her. 
"Just information about Archer. Clients, favored haunts, his daily schedule." 

Chaol's golden-brown eyes were molten in the firelight. "Why go to so 
much trouble to track him when you could just shoot him and be done with it? 
You said he was well-guarded, yet it seems like you tracked him easily 
today." 

She scowled. Chaol was too smart for his own good. "Because, if the king 
actually has a group of people conspiring against him, then I should get as 
much information about them as I can before I kill Archer. Perhaps following 
Archer will reveal more conspirators--or at least clues to their 
whereabouts." It was the truth--and she'd followed Archer's ornate carriage 
through the streets of the capital today for that very reason. 

But in the hours she'd spent trailing him, he'd gone only to a few 
appointments before returning to his townhouse. 

"Right," Chaol said. "So you're just ... memorizing that information 
now?" 

"If youre suggesting that I have no reason to be here and should leave, 
then tell me to go." 

"Tm just trying to figure out what's so boring that you dozed off ten 
minutes ago." 

She propped herself on her elbows. "I did not!" 

His brows rose. "I heard you snoring." 

"You're a liar, Chaol Westfall." She threw her paper at him and plopped 
back on the couch. "I only closed my eyes for a minute." 

He shook his head again and went back to work. 

Celaena blushed. "I didn't really snore, did I?" 

His face was utterly serious as he said, "Like a bear." 


She thumped a fist on the couch cushion. He grinned. She huffed, then 
draped her arm off the sofa, picking at the threads of the ancient rug as she 
stared up at the stone ceiling. "Tell me why you hate Roland." 

Chaol looked up. "I never said I hated him." 

She just waited. 

Chaol sighed. "I think it's fairly easy for you to see why I hate him." 

"But was there any incident that--" 

"There were many incidents, and I don't particularly feel like talking 
about any of them." 

She swung her legs off the arm of the couch and sat up straight. "Testy, 
aren't you?" 

She picked up another one of her documents, a map of the city that she'd 
marked up with the locations of Archer's clients. Most of them seemed to be 
in the posh district where the majority of Rifthold's elite lived. Archer's own 
townhouse was in that neighborhood, tucked into a quiet, respectable side 
street. She traced a nail along it, but paused when her eyes fell upon a street 
just a few blocks over. 

She knew that street--and knew the house that sat on its corner. Whenever 
she ventured into Rifthold, she took care to never pass too close to it. Today 
had been no different; she'd even gone a few blocks out of her way to avoid 
walking by. 

Not daring to look at Chaol, she asked, "Do you know who Rourke Farran 
is?" 

The name made her sick with long-suppressed rage and grief, but she 
managed to say it. Because even if she didn't want the entire truth ... there 
were some things she did need to know about her capture. Still needed to 
know, even after all this time. 

She felt Chaol's attention on her. "The crime lord?" 

She nodded, her eyes still on that street where so many things had gone so 
horribly wrong. "Have you ever dealt with him?" 

"No," Chaol said. "But ... that's because Farran is dead." 

She lowered the paper. "Farran's dead?" 

"Nine months ago. He and his three top men were all found murdered by 
... Chaol chewed on his lip, searching for the name. "Wesley. A man named 
Wesley took them all out. He was ..." Chaol cocked his head to the side. "He 


was Arobynn Hamel's personal guard." Her breath was tight in her chest. 
"Did you know him?" 

"I thought I did," she said softly. For the years she'd spent with Arobynn, 
Wesley had been a silent, deadly presence, a man who had barely tolerated 
her, and had always made it clear that if she ever became a threat to his 
master, he'd kill her. But on the night that she'd been betrayed and captured, 
Wesley had tried to stop her. She'd thought that it was because Arobynn had 
ordered her locked in her rooms, that it had been a way to keep her from 
seeking retribution for Sam's death at Farran's hands; but ... 

"What happened to Wesley?" she asked. "Did Farran's men catch him?" 

Chaol ran a hand through his hair, glancing down at the rug. "No. We 
found Wesley a day later--courtesy of Arobynn Hamel." 

She felt the blood drain from her face, but dared to ask, "How?" 

Chaol studied her closely, warily. "Wesley's body was impaled on the 
iron fence outside Rourke's house. There was ... enough blood to suggest 
that Wesley was alive when they did it. They never confessed, but we got the 
sense that the servants in the household had also been instructed to /et him 
stay there until he died. 

"We thought it was an attempt to balance the blood feud--so that when the 
next crime lord ascended, they wouldn't view Arobynn and his assassins as 
enemies." 

She stared at the carpet again. The might she'd broken out of the 
Assassins' Keep to hunt down Farran, Wesley had tried to stop her. He'd 
tried to tell her it was a trap. 

Celaena shut down the thought before it reached its conclusion. That was 
a truth she'd have to take out and examine at another time, when she was 
alone, when she didn't have Archer and the rebel movement and all that 
nonsense to worry about. When she could try to understand why Arobynn 
Hamel might have betrayed her--and what she was going to do with that 
horrible knowledge. How much she'd make him suffer--and bleed for it. 

After a few moments of silence, Chaol asked, "We never learned why 
Wesley went after Rourke Farran, though. Wesley was just a personal 
bodyguard. What did he have against Farran?" 

Her eyes were burning, and she looked to the window, where the night sky 
was bathed in moonlight. "It was an act of revenge." She could still see 
Sam's twisted corpse, lying on that table in the room beneath the Assassins' 


Keep; still see Farran crouched in front of her, his hands roaming over her 
paralyzed body. She swallowed down the tightness in her throat. "Farran 
captured, tortured, and then murdered one of ... one of my ... companions. 
And then the next night, I went out to repay the favor. It didn't end so well for 
me." 

A log shifted in the fire, breaking open and filling the room with a flash of 
light. 

"That was the night you were captured?" Chaol asked. "But I thought you 
didn't know who had betrayed you." 

"I still don't. Someone hired me and my companion to kill Farran, but it 
was all just a trap, and Farran was the bait." 

Silence; then--'What was his name?" 

She pushed her lips together, shoving away the memory of how he'd 
looked the last time she'd seen him, broken on that table. "Sam," she got out. 
"His name was Sam." She took an uneven breath. "I don't even know where 
they buried him. I don't even know who I would ask about it." 

Chaol didn't reply, and she didn't know why she bothered talking, but the 
words just tumbled out. "I failed him," she said. "In every way that counted, I 
failed him." 

Another long silence, then a sigh. "Not in one way," Chaol said. "I bet he 
would have wanted you to survive--to live. So you didn't fail him, not in that 
regard." 

She had to look away in order to force her eyes to stop burning as she 
nodded. 

After a moment, Chaol spoke again. "Her name was Lithaen. Three years 
ago, she worked for one of the ladies of the court. And Roland somehow 
found out and thought it would be amusing for me to discover him in bed with 
her. I know it's nothing like what you went through ..." 

She'd never known that he'd ever been interested in anyone, but ... "Why 
did she do it?" 

He shrugged, though his face was still bleak with the memory. "Because 
Roland is a Havilliard, and I'm just the Captain of the Guard. He even 
convinced her to go back to Meah with him--though I never learned what 
became of her." 

"You loved her." 


"I thought I did. And I thought she loved me." He shook his head, as if 
silently chiding himself. "Did Sam love you?" 

Yes. More than anyone had ever loved her. He'd loved her enough to risk 
everything--to give up everything. He'd loved her so much that she still felt 
the echoes of it, even now. "Very much," she breathed. 

The clock chimed eleven thirty, and Chaol shook his head, the tension 
falling from him. "I'm exhausted." 

She stood, somehow having no clue how they'd wound up talking about 
the people who had meant so much to them. "Then I should go." 

He got to his feet, his eyes so bright. "P11 walk you back to your room." 

She lifted her chin. "I thought I didn't need to be escorted everywhere 
now." 

"You don't," he said, walking to the door. "But it is something that friends 
tend to do." 

"Would you walk Dorian back to his room?" She batted her eyelashes at 
him, striding through the door as he opened it for her. "Or is this a privilege 
that only your lady-friends receive?" 

"Tf I had any lady-friends, I'd certainly extend the offer. 'm not sure you 
qualify as a lady, though." 

"So chivalrous. No wonder those girls find excuses to be in the gardens 
every morning." 

He snorted, and they fell silent as they walked through the quiet, dim halls 
of the castle, making their way back to her rooms on the other side. It was a 
trek, and often a cold one, since many of the halls were lined with windows 
that didn't keep out the winter chill. 

When they reached the door to her rooms, he bid her a quick good night 
and began to walk away. Her fingers were around the brass door handle 
when she turned to him. 

"For what it's worth, Chaol," she said. He faced her, his hands in his 
pockets. She gave him a slight smile. "If she picked Roland over you, that 
makes her the greatest fool who ever lived." 

He stared at her for a long moment before he quietly said, "Thank you," 
and walked back to his room. 

Celaena watched him go, watched those powerful muscles shifting in his 
back, visible even through his dark tunic, suddenly grateful that this Lithaen 
had long ago left the castle. 


The midnight hour chimed through the castle, the off-kilter ringing of the 
wretched clock tower in the garden echoing through the dark, silent halls. 
Though Chaol had escorted her to her door, five minutes of pacing in her 
bedroom had sent her wandering again, heading for the library. She had 
mountains of unread books sitting in her rooms but didn't feel like reading 
any of them. She needed something to do. Something to take her mind off her 
discussion with Chaol and the memories she'd dragged into the open tonight. 

Celaena wrapped her cloak tightly around her, glaring at the fierce winds 
whipping the snow outside the drafty windows. Hopefully there would be a 
few hearths lit in the library. If not, she'd grab a book that did interest her, 
run back to her room, and curl up with Fleetfoot in her toasty bed. 

Celaena turned a corner, entering the dark, window-lined hallway that ran 
past the towering doors of the library, and froze. 

With the chill tonight, it was no surprise to see someone completely 
concealed by a black cloak, hood drawn far over the face. But something 
about the figure standing between the open library doors made some ancient, 
primal part of her send a warning pulse so strong that she didn't take another 
step. 

The person swiveled its head toward her, pausing as well. 

Outside the hall windows, snow swirled, pressing against the glass. 

It was just a person, she told herself as the figure now turned to face her 
fully. A person wearing a cloak darker than might, a hood so heavy it 
concealed every feature of the face inside. 

It sniffed at her, a huffing, animal sound. 

She didn't dare move. 

It sniffed again, and took a step toward her. The way it moved, like smoke 
and shadow ... 

A faint warmth bloomed against her chest, then a pulsing blue light-- 

The Eye of Elena was glowing. 

The thing halted, and Celaena stopped breathing. 

It hissed, and then slithered a step back into the shadows beyond the 
library doors. The tiny blue gem in the center of her amulet glowed brighter, 
and Celaena blinked against the light. 

When she opened her eyes, the amulet was dark, and the hooded creature 
was gone. 


Not a trace, not even a sound of footsteps. 

Celaena didn't go into the library. Oh, no. She just walked quickly back to 
her rooms with as much dignity as she could muster. Though she kept telling 
herself that she'd imagined it all, that it was some hallucination from too 
many hours awake, Celaena couldn't stop hearing that cursed word again and 
again. 

Plans. 


Chapter 6 


The person outside the library probably had nothing to do with the king, 
Celaena told herself as she walked--still not sprinting--down the hall to her 
room. There were plenty of strange people in a castle this large, and even 
though she rarely saw another soul in the library, perhaps some people just 

. wished to go to the library alone. And unidentified. In a court where 
reading was so out of fashion, perhaps it was merely some courtier trying to 
hide a passionate love of books from his or her sneering friends. 

Some animalistic, eerie courtier. Who had caused her amulet to glow. 

Celaena entered her bedroom just as the lunar eclipse was beginning, and 
groaned. "Of course there's an eclipse," she grumbled, turning from the 
balcony doors and approaching the tapestry along the wall. 

And even though she didn't want to, even though she'd hoped to never see 
Elena again ... she needed answers. 

Maybe the dead queen would laugh at her and tell her it was nothing. 
Gods above, she hoped Elena would say that. Because if she didn't ... 

Celaena shook her head and glanced at Fleetfoot. "Care to join me?" The 
dog, as if sensing what she was about to do, made a good show of turning 
circles on the bed and curling up with a huff. "I thought so." 

In a matter of moments, Celaena shoved the large chest of drawers from 
its spot in front of the tapestry that hid the secret door, grabbed a candle, and 
began walking down, down, down the forgotten stairs to the landing far 
below. 

The three stone archways greeted her. The one on the far left led to a 
passage that allowed for spying on the Great Hall. The one in the center led 
to the sewers and the concealed exit that might someday save her life. And 
the one on the right ... that one led down to the ancient queen's forgotten 
tomb. 

As she walked to the tomb, she didn't dare look at the landing where 
she'd discovered Cain summoning the ridderak from another world, even 
though the debris of the door the creature had shattered still littered the stairs. 
There were gouges in the stone wall where the ridderak had come crashing 


through, chasing her down to the tomb, until she'd just barely reached 
Damaris, sword of the long-dead King Gavin, in time to slay the monster. 

Celaena glanced at her hand, where a ring of white scars punctured her 
palm and encircled her thumb. If Nehemia hadn't found her that night, the 
poison from the ridderak's bite would have killed her. 

At last, she reached the door at the bottom of the spiral staircase and 
found herself staring at the skull-shaped bronze knocker in its center. 

Perhaps this hadn't been a good idea. Perhaps the answers weren't worth 
it. 

She should go back upstairs. Come to think of it, this could only be bad. 

Elena had seemed satisfied that Celaena had obeyed her command to 
become the King's Champion, but if she showed up, then it would seem like 
she was willing to do another one of Elena's tasks. And the Wyrd knew that 
she had enough on her hands right now. 

Even if that--that thing in the hall just now hadn't seemed friendly. 

The skull knocker seemed to smile at her, its hollow eyes boring into hers. 

Gods above, she should just leave. 

But her fingers were somehow reaching for the door handle, as if an 
invisible hand were guiding her. 

"Aren't you going to knock?" 

Celaena leapt back, a dagger already in her hand and angled to spill blood 
as she pressed herself into the wall. It was impossible--she had to have 
imagined it. 

The skill knocker had spoken. Its mouth had moved up and down. 

Yes, this was certainly, absolutely, undeniably impossible. Far more 
unlikely and incomprehensible than anything Elena had ever said or done. 

Staring at her with gleaming metal eyes, the bronze skull clicked its 
tongue. It had a tongue. 

Maybe she'd slipped on the stairs and smacked her head into the stones. 
That would make more sense than this. An endless, filthy stream of curses 
began flowing through her head, each more vulgar than the next, as she gaped 
at the knocker. 

"Oh, don't be so pathetic," the skull huffed, its eyes narrowing. "I'm 
attached to this door. I cannot harm you." 

"But you' re"--she swallowed hard--"magic." 





It was impossible--it should be impossible. Magic was gone, vanished 
from the land ten years ago, before it had even been outlawed by the king. 

"Everything in this world is magic. Thank you ever so kindly for stating 
the obvious." 

She calmed her reeling mind long enough to say, "But magic doesn't work 
anymore." 

"New magic doesn't. But the king cannot erase old spells made with older 
powers--like the Wyrdmarks. Those ancient spells still hold; especially 
ones that imbue life." 

"You're ... alive?" 

The knocker chuckled. "Alive? I'm made of bronze. I do not breathe, nor 
do I eat or drink. So, no, I am not alive. Nor am I dead, for that matter. I 
simply exist." 

She stared at the small knocker. It was no larger than her fist. 

"You should apologize," it said. "You have no idea how loud and 
tiresome you' ve been these past few months, with all your running down here 
and slaying foul beasties. I kept quiet until I thought you'd witnessed enough 
strange things that you could accept my existence. But apparently, I am to be 
disappointed." 

Hands trembling, she sheathed her dagger and set down her candle. "I'm 
so glad you finally found me worth speaking to." 

The bronze skull closed its eyes. The skull had eyelids. How had she not 
noticed it before? "Why should I speak to someone who doesn't have the 
courtesy to greet me, or even to knock?" 

Celaena took a calming breath and looked at the door. The stones of the 
threshold still bore gouges from where the ridderak had passed through. "Is 
she in there?" 

"Is who in there?" the skull said coyly. 

""Elena--the queen." 

"Of course she is. She's been in there for a thousand years." The skull's 
eyes seemed to glow. 

"Don't mock me, or P11 peel you off this door and melt you down." 

"Not even the strongest man in the world could peel me from this door. 
King Brannon himself put me here to watch over her tomb." 

"You're that old?" 

The skull huffed. "How insensitive of you to insult me about my age." 


Celaena crossed her arms. Nonsense--magic always led to nonsense like 
this. "What's your name?" 

"What is your name?" 

"Celaena Sardothien," she ground out. 

The skull barked a laugh. "Oh, that is too funny! The funniest thing lve 
heard in centuries!" 

"Be quiet." 

"My name is Mort, if you must know." 

She picked up the candle. "Can I expect all of our encounters to be this 
pleasant?" She reached for the door handle. 

"Aren't you even going to knock, after all that? You truly have no 
manners." 

She used all of her self-control to avoid banging on his little face as she 
made three unnecessarily loud knocks on the wooden door. 

Mort smirked as the door silently swung open. "Celaena Sardothien," he 
said to himself, and began laughing again. Celaena hissed in his direction and 
kicked the door shut. 

The tomb was dim with foggy light, and Celaena approached the grate 
through which it poured, carried down from the surface by a silver-coated 
shaft. It was normally brighter in here, but the eclipse made the tomb 
increasingly murky. 

She paused not too far from the threshold, set the candle on the floor, and 
found herself staring at--nothing. 

Elena wasn't there. 

"Hello?" 

Mort chuckled from the other side of the door. 

Celaena rolled her eyes and yanked the door back open. Of course Elena 
wouldn't actually be here when she had an important question. Of course 
she'd only have something like Mort to talk to. Of course, of course, of 
course. 

"Is she coming tonight?" Celaena demanded. 

"No," Mort said simply, as if she should have known already. "She nearly 
burnt herself out helping you these past few months." 

"What? So she's ... gone?" 

"For the time being--until she regains her strength." 


Celaena crossed her arms, taking yet another long, long breath. The 
chamber seemed the same as it had been the last time she was here. Two 
stone sarcophagi lay in the center, one depicting Gavin, Elena's husband and 
the first King of Adarlan, and the other Elena, both with eerily lifelike 
quality. Elena's silver hair spilled over the side of the coffin, disrupted only 
by the crown atop her head and the delicately pointed ears that marked her as 
half human, half Fae. Celaena's attention lingered on the words etched at 
Elena's feet: Ah! Time's Rift! 

Brannon, Elena's Fae father--not to mention the first King of Terrasen-- 
had carved the words into the sarcophagus himself. 

The whole tomb was strange, actually. Stars had been carved into the 
floor, and trees and flowers adorned the arched ceiling. The walls were all 
etched with Wyrdmarks, the ancient symbols that could be used to access a 
power that still worked--a power that Nehemia and her family had long kept 
secret until Cain had somehow mastered it. If the king ever learned of their 
power, if he knew it could summon creatures as Cain had done, he could 
unleash endless evil upon Erilea. And his plans would become even more 
deadly. 

"But Elena did tell me that if you deigned to come here again," Mort said, 
"she had a message for you." 

Celaena had a feeling of standing in front of a cresting wave, waiting- 
waiting-waiting for it to break. It could wait--the message could wait, the 
oncoming burden could wait--for another moment or two of freedom. She 
walked to the back of the tomb, which had been piled with jewels and gold 
and trunks overflowing with treasure. 

Before it all was displayed a suit of armor and Damaris, the legendary 
sword of Gavin. Its hilt was silvery gold and had little ornamentation save 
for a pommel in the shape of an eye. No jewel lay in the socket; it was only 
an empty ring of gold. Some legends claimed that when Galavin wielded 
Damaris, he would see only the truth, and that was why he had been crowned 
king. Or some nonsense like that. 

Damaris's scabbard was decorated by a few Wyrdmarks. Everything 
seemed connected to those blasted symbols. Celaena scowled and examined 
the king's armor. It still bore scratches and indentations upon its golden front. 
From battles, no doubt. Perhaps even the fight with Erawan, the dark lord 
who had led an army of demons and the dead against the continent when the 
kingdoms had been little more than warring territories. 


Elena had said that she was a warrior, too. But her armor was nowhere to 
be seen. Where had it gone? It was probably lying forgotten in a castle 
somewhere in the kingdoms. 

Forgotten. The same way legend had reduced the fierce warrior-princess 
to nothing more than a damsel in a tower, whom Gavin had rescued. 

"It's not over, is it?" Celaena asked Mort at last. 

"No," Mort said, quieter than he'd been before. This was what Celaena 
had been dreading for weeks--for months. 

The moonlight in the tomb was fading. Soon the eclipse would be 
complete, and the tomb would be dark, save for the candle. 

"Let's hear her message," Celaena said, sighing. 

Mort cleared his throat, and then said in a voice that sounded eerily like 
the queen's, ""If I could leave you in peace, I would. But you have lived your 
life aware that you will never escape certain burdens. Whether you like it or 
not, you are bound to the fate of this world. As the King's Champion, you are 
now in a position of power, and you can make a difference in the lives of 
many.' Celaena's stomach turned over. 

"Cain and the ridderak were just the beginning of the threat to Erilea," 
Mort said, the words echoing around the tomb. "There is a far deadlier 
power poised to devour the world." 

"And I have to find it, I suppose?" 

"Yes. There will be clues to lead you to it. Signs you must follow. 
Refusing to kill the king's targets is only the first and smallest step." 

Celaena looked toward the ceiling, as if she could see through the tree- 
carved surface to the library far, far above. "I saw someone in the castle 
hallway tonight. Something. It made the amulet glow." 

"Human?" Mort asked, sounding reluctantly intrigued. 

"I don't know," Celaena admitted. "It didn't feel like it." She closed her 
eyes, taking a steadying breath. She'd been waiting for this for months. "It's 
all connected to the king, isn't it? All of these awful things? Even Elena's 
command--that's about finding whatever power he has, the threat he poses." 

"You already know the answer to that." 

Her heart thundered--with fear, with anger, she didn't know. "If she's so 
damn powerful and knows so much, then she can go find the king's source of 
power herself." 

"Itis your fate, and your responsibility." 


"There is no such thing as fate," Celaena hissed. 

"Says the girl who was saved from the ridderak because some force 
compelled her down here on Samhuinn, to see Damaris and learn it was 
here." 

Celaena took a step closer to the door. "Says the girl who spent a year in 
Endovier. Says the girl who knows that the gods care no more for our lives 
than we care for an insect beneath our feet." She glared into Mort's gleaming 
face. "Come to think of it, I can't quite recall why I should bother helping 
Erilea, when the gods so clearly don't bother to help us, either." 

"You don't mean that," he said. 

Celaena gripped the hilt of her dagger. "I do. So tell Elena to find some 
other fool to impose upon." 

"You must discover where the king's power comes from and what he 
plans to do--before it's too late." 

Celaena snorted. "Don't you understand? It's already too late. It's been 
too late for years now. Where was Elena ten years ago, when there was a 
whole host of heroes that she could have had her pick of? Where were she 
and her ridiculous quests when the world truly needed them--when 
Terrasen's heroes were cut down or hunted and executed by Adarlan's 
armies? Where was she when the kingdoms fell, one by one, to the king?" 
Her eyes burned, but she shoved the pain down to that dark place where it 
dwelled inside of her. "The world is already in ruin, and I won't be set on 
some fool's errand." 

Mort's eyes narrowed. Inside the tomb, the light had faded; the moon was 
almost fully covered now. "I am sorry for what you have lost," he said in a 
voice that was not quite his. "And I am sorry about your parents' deaths that 
night. It was--" 

"Don't you ever talk about my parents," Celaena snarled, pointing a finger 
at his face. "I don't give a damn if you're magic or if you're Elena's lackey 
or if you're just some figment of my imagination. You talk about my parents 
again, and III hack this door to pieces. Understand?" 

Mort just glowered at her. "You're that selfish? That cowardly? Why did 
you come down here tonight, Celaena? To help us all? Or just to help 
yourself? Elena told me about you--about your past." 

"Shut your rutting face," she snapped, and stormed up the stairs. 


Chapter 7 


Celaena awoke before dawn with a pounding headache. It took one look at 
the mostly melted candle on her nightstand to know that her encounter in the 
tomb hadn't been some awful dream. Which meant that far beneath her room, 
there was a talking door knocker imbued with an ancient animation spell. 
And that Elena had yet again found a way to make her life infinitely more 
complicated. 

Celaena groaned and buried her face in her pillow. She'd meant what she 
said last night. The world was beyond helping. Even if ... even if she'd seen 
firsthand just how dangerous things could become--how much worse it 
could be. And that person in the hall ... 

She flipped onto her back, and Fleetfoot poked her cheek with a wet nose. 
Idly stroking the dog's head, Celaena stared up at the ceiling and the pale 
gray light seeping through the curtains. 

She didn't want to admit it, but Mort was right. She'd gone to the tomb 
just to have Elena deal with the creature in the hallway--to be reassured that 
she wouldn't have to do anything. 

My plans, the king had said. And if Elena was warning her to uncover 
them, to find the source of his power ... then they had to be bad. Worse than 
the slaves in Calaculla and Endovier, worse than putting down more rebels. 

She watched the ceiling for another few moments, until two things became 
clear. 

The first was that if she didn't uncover this threat, it might be a fatal 
mistake. Elena had just said she had to find it. She hadn't said anything about 
destroying it. Nothing about facing the king. Which was a relief, Celaena 
supposed. 

And the second was that she needed to speak with Archer--to get closer 
and start figuring out a way to fake his death. Because if he truly was a part 
of this movement that knew what the king was up to, then perhaps he could 
save her the trouble of spying on the king and piecing together whatever clues 
she could find. But once she took that step toward approaching Archer ... 
Well, then everything would certainly become a lethal game. 


So Celaena quickly bathed and then dressed in her finest, warmest clothes 
before calling for Chaol. 
It was time for her to conveniently run into Archer Finn. 


Thanks to the snow from the night before, some poor souls had been 
conscripted into shoveling Rifthold's most fashionable districts. Businesses 
stayed open year-round, and despite the slick sidewalks and slushy 
cobblestone streets, the capital city was just as vibrant that afternoon as it 
was at the height of summer. 

Still, Celaena wished it were summer, since the wet streets soaked the 
hem of her ice-blue gown, and it was so cold that not even her white fur 
cloak could keep out the chill. As they walked down the crowded main 
avenue, she kept close to Chaol. He had been pestering her again to let him 
help with Archer, and inviting him along today was the most harmless thing 
she could do to get him off her back about it. She'd insisted he wear normal 
clothes instead of his captain's uniform. 

To him, that meant showing up in a black tunic. 

Thankfully, no one paid them much heed--not when there were so many 
people, and so many stores. Oh, how she adored this avenue, where all the 
fine things in the world were sold and bartered! Jewelers, hatters, clothiers, 
confectioneries, cobblers ... Unsurprisingly, Chaol stomped right past every 
shop window, not even glancing at the delights displayed inside. 

As usual, there was a crowd outside the Willows--the tea court where 
she knew Archer was having his lunch. He seemed to dine here every day 
with a few other male courtesans. Of course, it had nothing to do with the 
fact that most of Rifthold's elite patronesses also dined here. 

She grabbed Chaol's arm as they drew near the tea court. "If you walk up 
looking like you're going to pummel someone," she crooned, linking her 
elbow through his, "then he'll certainly know something is amiss. And, again, 
do not say anything to him. Leave the talking and the charming to me." 

Chaol raised his brows. "So I'm just here for decoration?" 

"Be grateful I consider you a worthy accessory." 

He grumbled something under his breath that she was fairly certain she 
would not want to hear, but still slowed his pace to a rather elegant walk. 


Outside the arched stone-and-glass entrance to the tea court, fine carriages 
loitered in the street, people hopping in and out of them. They could have 
taken a carriage--should have taken a carriage, given how cold it was and 
the fact of her now-sodden gown. But she'd foolishly wanted to walk, to see 
the city on the arm of the Captain of the Guard, even if he spent the entire 
time looking like a threat was lurking around every corner and down every 
alley. Come to think of it, a carriage probably would have made a better 
entrance, too. 

Entry to the Willows required a hard-to-attain membership; Celaena had 
taken her tea there several times while growing up, thanks to Arobynn 
Hamel's name. She could still recall the clink of porcelain, the hushed 
gossip, the mint-and-cream painted room, and the floor-to-ceiling windows 
that overlooked an exquisite garden. 

"We're not going in there," Chaol said, and it wasn't exactly a question. 

She gave him a feline grin. "You aren't afraid of a bunch of stuffy old 
ladies and giggling young women, are you?" He glared at her, and she patted 
his arm. "Weren't you listening when I explained my plan? We're just going 
to pretend that we're waiting for our table. So don't fret: you won't have to 
fight off all the mean little ladies clawing at you." 

"The next time we train," he said as they eased through the throng of 
beautifully dressed women, "remind me to wallop you." 

An elderly woman turned to glare at him, and Celaena gave her an 
apologetic and exasperated look, as if to say, Men! She then promptly dug 
her nails into Chaol's thick winter tunic and hissed, "This is the part where 
you shut your mouth and pretend to be a woolly-headed bit of decoration. 
Shouldn't be too hard for you." 

His returning pinch told her that he was really going to make her sweat the 
next time they were in the training room. She grinned. 

After finding a spot just below the steps that led up to the double doors, 
Celaena glanced at her pocket watch. Archer had begun dining at two, and 
usually the meal was over within ninety minutes, which meant he'd be 
leaving any second now. She made a good show of pretending to rummage 
through her small coin purse, and Chaol, mercifully, kept quiet, observing the 
crowd around them, as if these fancy women might attack them at any 
moment. 


A few minutes passed, and her gloved hands grew numb as people 
continued walking into and out of the tea court, so often that no one bothered 
to notice that they were the only ones who weren t about to go in. But then the 
front doors opened, and Celaena caught a glimpse of bronze hair and a 
dazzling smile, and she moved. 

Chaol played along with expert skill, escorting her up the steps, up, up, 
until-- 

"Oomph!" she cried, slamming into a broad, muscled shoulder. Chaol 
even pulled her to him, a supporting hand on her back to keep her from 
toppling down the stairs. She looked up through her lashes, and then-- 

A blink, two blinks. 

The exquisite face gaping at her broke into a grin. "Laena?"' 

She'd planned to smile anyway, but when she heard his old pet name for 
her ... "Archer!" 

She felt Chaol stiffen slightly, but she didn't bother to glance at him. It 
was hard to look away from Archer, who had been and still was the most 
beautiful man she'd ever seen. Not handsome--beautiful. His skin glowed 
golden even in the height of winter, and his green eyes ... 

Gods above and Wyrd save me. 

His mouth was a work of art, too, all sensual lines and softness that 
begged to be explored. 

As if emerging from a daze, Archer suddenly shook his head. "We should 
get off the steps," he said, extending a broad hand to gesture to the street 
below them. "Unless you and your companion have a reservation--" 

"Oh, we're a few minutes early, anyway," she said, letting go of Chaol's 
arm to walk back onto the street. Archer followed beside her, giving her a 
glance at his clothes--expertly tailored tunic and pants, knee-high boots, a 
heavy cloak. None of it screamed wealth, but she could tell it was all 
expensive. Unlike some of the flashier and softer male courtesans, Archer's 
appeal had always been more ruggedly masculine. 

The broad, muscled shoulders and powerful frame; the knowing smile; 
even his beautiful face radiated a sense of maleness that had her struggling to 
remember what she'd planned to say. 

Even Archer seemed to be searching for words as they faced each other 
on the street, a few steps away from the busy crowd. 


"It's been a while," she began, smiling again. Chaol remained a step 
away, utterly silent. And unsmiling. 

Archer stuffed his hands into his pockets. "I almost didn't recognize you. 
You were just a girl when I saw you last. You were ... Gods above, you 
were thirteen, I think." 

She couldn't help herself--she looked up at him from beneath lowered 
lashes and purred, "I'm not thirteen anymore." 

Archer gave her a slow, sensual smile as he took her in from head to toe 
before saying, "It would certainly seem that way." 

"You filled out a bit more, too," she said, returning the favor of surveying 
him. 

Archer grinned. "Comes with the profession." He angled his head to the 
side, then flicked his magnificent eyes to Chaol, who now stood with his 
arms crossed. She still remembered how adept Archer had been at taking in 
details. It was probably part of the reason he'd become the top male 
courtesan in Rifthold. And a formidable opponent when Celaena was training 
at the Assassins' Keep. 

She glanced at Chaol, who was too busy staring down Archer to notice 
her attention. "He knows everything," she told Archer. Some tension flowed 
out of Archer's shoulders, but the surprise and amusement were also wearing 
off, replaced by hesitant pity. 

"How'd you get out?" Archer asked carefully--still not mentioning 
anything about her profession or Endovier, despite her reassurance that Chaol 
knew. 

"I was let out. By the king. I work for him now." 

Archer eyed Chaol again, and she took a step toward the courtesan. "He's 
a friend," she said softly. Was it suspicion or fear in his eyes? And was it 
merely because she worked for a tyrant that the world feared, or because 
he'd actually turned rebel and had something to hide? She kept herself as 
casual as possible, as unthreatening and relaxed as anyone might be upon 
encountering an old friend. 

Archer asked, "Does Arobynn know you're back?" 

That was not a question she'd prepared for, or wanted to hear. She 
shrugged. "He has eyes everywhere; ld be surprised if he didn't know." 

Archer nodded solemnly. "I'm sorry. I heard about Sam--and about what 
happened at Farran's house that night." He shook his head, closing his eyes. 


"Tm just--sorry." 

Even though her heart twisted at his words, she nodded. "Thank you." 

She put a hand on Chaol's arm, suddenly needing just to touch him, to 
make sure he was still there. Needing to stop talking about this, too, she 
sighed and pretended to look interested in the glass doors at the top of the 
Steps. 

"We should go inside," she lied. She gave Archer a smile. "I know I was 
a miserable little brat when you trained at the Keep, but ... do you want to 
have dinner with me tomorrow? I have the night off." 

"You certainly had your moments back then." Archer returned her smile 
and sketched a bow. "Ill have to move some appointments around, but I'd be 
delighted." He reached into his cloak and pulled out a cream-colored card, 
engraved with his name and address. "Just send word about where and when, 
and P' Il be there." 


Celaena had been quiet since Archer left, and Chaol hadn't tried to initiate 
conversation with her, though he was near bursting to say something. 

He didn't even know where to start. 

During the whole exchange, all he'd really been able to think about was 
how much he wanted to slam Archer's pretty face against the stone building. 

Chaol wasn't a fool. He knew some of her smiles and blushing hadn't 
been acted. And though he had no claim on her--though making a claim 
would be the stupidest thing he could ever do--the thought of her being 
susceptible to Archer's charms made him want to have a little chat with the 
courtesan. 

Rather than head back to the castle, she began walking through the wealthy 
district in the heart of the city, her steps unhurried. After nearly thirty minutes 
of silence, Chaol figured he'd cooled his temper enough to be civil. 
"Laena?" he demanded. 

Slightly civil, at least. 

The gold streaks in her turquoise eyes were bright in the afternoon sun. 
"Of all the things we said back there, that is what bothered you most?" 

It did. Wyrd keep him, it bothered the hell out of him. 

"When you said you knew him, I didn't realize you meant that well." He 
fought the strange, sudden temper that was honing itself again. Even if she'd 


been charmed by his looks, she was going to kill Archer, he had to remind 
himself: 

"My history with Archer will allow me to get him to provide information 
about whatever this rebel movement is," she said, looking up at the fine 
houses they passed. The residential streets were tranquil despite the bustling 
city center only a few blocks down. "He's one of the few people who 
actually /ikes me, you know. Or he did years ago. It shouldn't be too hard to 
get some inkling of what this group might be planning against the king--or 
who the other members might be." 

Part of him, he knew, should be ashamed for finding some relief in the fact 
that she was going to kill him. He was a better man than that--and he 
certainly wasn't the territorial type. 

And the gods knew he had no claim on her. He'd seen the look on her face 
when Archer had mentioned Sam. 

He'd heard of Sam Cortland's death in passing. He'd never known that 
Celaena and Sam had crossed paths, that Celaena had ever ... ever loved that 
fiercely. On the night she was captured, she hadn't been out to collect cold 
coin for a contract--no, she'd gone into that house to get revenge for the sort 
of loss he couldn't begin to imagine. 

They walked down the street, her side nearly pressed against his. He 
fought against the urge to lean into her, to tuck her in closer. 

"Chaol?" she said after a few minutes. 

"Hmm?" 

"You know I absolutely hate it when he calls me Laena, don't you?" 

A smile tugged at his lips, along with a flicker of relief. "So the next time 
I want to piss you off ..." 

"Don't you even think about it." 

His smile spread, and the flicker of relief turned to something that 
punched him in the gut when she smiled back. 


Chapter 8 


She had planned to spend the rest of the day following Archer from a 
distance, but as they walked from the tea court, Chaol informed her that the 
king had ordered her to assist with guard duty at a state dinner that mght. And 
though she could think of a thousand excuses to get out of it, any suspicious 
behavior on her part could draw the wrong sort of attention. If she was 
actually going to listen to Elena this time, she needed the king--she needed 
his entire empire--to think she was his obedient servant. 

The state dinner was in the Great Hall, and it took all of Celaena's self- 
control to keep from sprinting to the long table in the center of the room and 
horking down the food right off the plates of the gathered councilmen and 
preening nobility. Roasted lamb rubbed with thyme and lavender, duck 
glazed with orange sauce, pheasant swimming in green-onion gravy ... Truly, 
it wasn't fair. 

Chaol had stationed her by a pillar near the glass patio doors. Though she 
wasn't wearing the royal guards' black uniform with the gold embroidered 
wyvern across the chest, she blended in well enough in her dark clothes. At 
least she was so far away from it all that no one could hear her stomach 
grumbling. 

Other tables had been set up, too--full of lesser nobility who had been 
invited to join, all impeccably dressed for the occasion. Most of the attention 
--of the guards, of the nobility--remained on the center table, where the king 
and queen sat with their innermost court. Duke Perrington, the hulking brute, 
also sat there, and Dorian and Roland were nearby, chatting with the 
precious, pampered men who made up the king's council. Men who had bled 
other kingdoms dry to pay for the clothes and jewels and gold in this room. 
Not that she was much better, in some regards. 

Though she tried to avoid looking at the king, every time she did steal a 
glance at him, she wondered why he bothered attending these events when he 
could do away with this nonsense altogether. She gleaned nothing, though. 
And she didn't think for a moment that he'd be stupid enough to reveal 
anything about his true agenda in front of all these people. 

Chaol stood at attention at the column nearest the king's chair, his eyes 
darting everywhere, always alert. He had his best men here tonight--all 


handpicked by him that afternoon. He didn't seem to realize that no one 
would be so suicidal as to attack the king and his court at such a public event. 
She'd tried explaining that, but Chaol had just glared at her and told her not 
to cause trouble. 

As if she'd be that suicidal. 

The meal ended with the king standing up and bidding his guests farewell, 
the auburn-haired Queen Georgina dutifully and silently following him out of 
the Great Hall. The other guests remained, but now milled about from table 
to table, chatting with far more ease than they had while the king was present. 

Dorian was on his feet, Roland still beside him as they spoke to three 
remarkably pretty young courtiers. Roland said something that set the girls 
giggling and blushing behind their lace fans, and Dorian's lips stretched 
toward a smile. 

He couldnt like Roland. She had nothing more than gut feeling and 
Chaol's story to go by, but ... there was something about Roland's emerald 
eyes that made her want to pull Dorian as far away from him as possible. 
Dorian was playing a dangerous game, too, she realized. As Crown Prince, 
he had to walk a careful line with certain people. Perhaps she'd speak to 
Chaol about it. 

Celaena frowned. Telling Chaol could lead to tedious explanations. 
Maybe she'd just warn Dorian herself once this dinner was over. She had 
ended things with him romantically, but she still cared about him. Despite his 
history with women, he was everything that a prince should be: intelligent, 
kind, charming. Why hadn't Elena approached him for her tasks? 

Dorian couldn't possibly know what his father was up to--no, he couldn't 
act the way he did if he knew that his father had such sinister intent. And 
maybe he shouldn't ever know. 

No matter what she felt for him, Dorian would rule. And maybe his father 
would someday reveal his power and force Dorian to make a choice about 
what sort of ruler he wanted to become. But she was in no hurry to have 
Dorian make that choice; not yet. When he did, she could only pray that he 
would be a better king than his father. 


Dorian knew Celaena was watching him. She'd been stealing glances at him 
throughout the whole insufferable dinner. But she'd also been looking at 


Chaol, and when she did, he could have sworn that her whole face changed 
--became softer, more contemplative. 

She lounged against a pillar by the patio doors, cleaning her nails with a 
dagger. Thank the Wyrd his father had left, because he was fairly certain the 
king would have flayed her for it. 

Roland said something else to the three ladies in front of them--girls 
whose names Dorian had heard and immediately forgotten--and they giggled 
again. Roland certainly rivaled him for charm. And it seemed that Roland's 
mother had come with him to find the young lord a bride--a girl with land 
and money that would add to Meah's importance. Dorian didn't have to ask 
Roland to know that until his wedding night, his cousin would enjoy all of the 
benefits of living in the castle as a young lord. 

Listening to him flirt, watching him grin at these girls, Dorian didn't know 
whether he wanted to punch Roland or walk away. But years of living in this 
festering court kept Dorian from doing anything but looking gloriously bored. 

He glanced at Celaena again, only to see her watching Chaol, whose eyes 
were in turn fixed on Roland. Sensing Dorian's attention, Celaena met his 
gaze. 

Nothing. Not a hint of emotion. Dorian's temper flared, so fast that he 
found himself struggling for control. Especially as she looked away again-- 
and her focus returned to the captain. And stayed there. Enough. 

Not bothering to say good-bye to Roland or the girls, he strode out of the 
Great Hall. He had better, more important things to worry about than what 
Celaena felt for his friend. He was the Crown Prince of the largest empire in 
the world. His entire existence was bound to the crown and the glass throne 
that would someday be his. She'd ended things because of that crown and 
throne--because she wanted a freedom he could never give her. 

"Dorian," someone called as he entered the hallway. He didn't have to 
turn around to know it was Celaena. She caught up to him, easily matching 
the brisk pace he hadn't realized he'd set. He didn't even know where he 
was going, only that he needed to get out of the Great Hall. She touched his 
elbow, and he hated himself for savoring the touch. 

"What do you want?" he asked. 

They passed beyond the busy halls and she tugged on his arm, slowing him 
down. "What's wrong?" 

"Why would anything be wrong?" 


How long have you been yearning for him? was what he really wanted to 
ask. Damn him for caring. Damn him for every moment he'd spent with her. 

"You look like you could splatter someone against a wall." 

He raised an eyebrow. He hadn't been making a face. 

"When you get angry," she explained, "your eyes get this ... cold look. 
Glazed." 

"Tm fine." 

They kept walking, and she kept following him to ... to wherever he was 
going. The library, he decided, turning down a passageway. He'd go to the 
royal library. 

"If you have something to say," he drawled, putting his temper on a tight 
leash, "then just say it." 

"I don't trust your cousin." 

He paused, the shining hallway around them empty. "You don't even know 

"Call it instinct." 

"Roland is harmless." 

"Maybe. But maybe not. Maybe he has his own agenda in being here. And 
you're too smart to be a pawn in anyone's game, Dorian. He's from Meah." 

"And?" 

"And Meah is a small, insignificant port city. It means he's got little to 
lose and a Zot to gain. That makes people dangerous. Ruthless. He'Il use you, 
if he can." 

"The same way an assassin from Endovier used me to become King's 
Champion?" 

Her lips thinned. "Is that what you think I did?" 

"I don't know what to think." He turned away. 

She snarled--actually snarled--at him. "Well, let me tell you what 7 
think, Dorian. I think you're used to getting what you want--who you want. 
And just because you couldn't get who you wanted this one time--" 

He whirled toward her. "You know nothing about what I wanted. You 
didn't even give me the chance to tell you." 

She rolled her eyes. "I'm not having this conversation right now. I came to 
warn you about your cousin, but you clearly don't care. So don't expect me to 


care when you find yourself nothing more than a puppet. If you aren't one 
already." 

He opened his mouth, so close to exploding he could have punched the 
nearest wall, but Celaena was already striding off. 


Celaena stood in front of the bars to Kaltain Rompier's cell. 

The once-beautiful lady was curled against the wall, her dress soiled and 
her dark hair unbound and matted. She had buried her face in her arms, but 
Celaena could still see that her skin gleamed with sweat and had a slightly 
grayish hue. And the smell ... 

She hadn't seen her since the duel; since the day Kaltain had drugged 
Celaena's water with bloodbane so she would die at Cain's hands. Once 
she'd defeated Cain, Celaena had left without witnessing the screaming fit 
that Kaltain had thrown. So she'd missed the moment where Kaltain had 
accidentally confessed to poisoning her, claiming to have been manipulated 
by her former beau, Duke Perrington. The duke had denied her accusations, 
and Kaltain had been sent down here to await her punishment. 

Two months later, it seemed that they still didn't know what to do with her 
--or didn't care. 

"Hello, Kaltain," Celaena said quietly. 

Kaltain lifted her head, her black eyes gleaming in recognition. "Hello, 
Celaena." 


Chapter 9 


Celaena took a step closer to the bars. A bucket for relieving herself, a 
bucket of water, the crumbs of her last meal, and moldy hay that formed a 
rough pallet; that was all Kaltain had been given. 

All she deserves. 

"Come to laugh?" Kaltain said. Her voice, which had once been rich and 
cultured, was little more than a hoarse whisper. It was freezing down here-- 
it was a wonder Kaltain hadn't fallen ill already. 

"I have some questions for you," Celaena said, keeping her words soft. 
Though the guards hadn't challenged her right to enter the dungeons, she 
didn't want them eavesdropping. 

"T'm busy today." Kaltain smiled, leaning her head against the stone wall. 
"Come back tomorrow." She looked so much younger with her ebony hair 
unbound. She couldn't be much older than Celaena herself. 

Celaena dropped into a crouch, one hand braced against the bars for 
balance. The metal was bitingly cold. "What do you know about Roland 
Havilliard?" 

Kaltain looked toward the stone ceiling. "He's visiting?" 

"He's been appointed to the king's council." 

Kaltain's night-dark eyes met Celaena's. There was a hint of madness 
there--but also wariness and exhaustion. "Why ask me about him?" 

"Because I want to know if he can be trusted." 

Kaltain wheezed a laugh. "None of us can be trusted. Especially not 
Roland. The things I've heard about him are enough to turn even your 
stomach, I bet." 

"Like what?" 

Kaltain smirked. "Get me out of this cell and I might tell you." 

Celaena returned the smirk. "How about I walk inside that cell and find 
another way to get you to talk?" 

"Don t," she whispered, shifting enough so that Celaena could see the 
bruises circling her wrists. They looked unnervingly like handprints. 

Kaltain tucked her arms into the folds of her skirts. "The night watch looks 
the other way when Perrington visits." 


Celaena bit the inside of her lip. "I'm sorry," she said, and meant it. And 
she would mention it to Chaol when she saw him next; make sure he had a 
word with the night watch. 

Kaltain rested her cheek on her knee. "He's ruined everything. And I don't 
even know why. Why not just send me home instead?" Her voice had taken 
on a faraway quality that Celaena recognized too well from her time in 
Endovier. Once the memories and the pain and the fear took over, there 
would be no chance of talking to her. 

She asked quietly, "You were close to Perrington. Did you ever overhear 
anything about his plans?" A dangerous question, but if anyone might tell her, 
it would be Kaltain. 

But the girl was staring at nothing and didn't reply. 

Celaena stood. "Good luck." 

Kaltain just shivered, tucking her hands under her arms. 

She should let Kaltain freeze to death for what she'd tried to do to her. 
She should walk out of the dungeons smiling, because for once the right 
person was locked away. 

"They encourage the crows to fly past here," Kaltain murmured, more to 
herself than to Celaena. "And my headaches are worse every day. Worse and 
worse, and full of all of those flapping wings." 

Celaena kept her face blank. She couldn't hear anything--no caws, and 
certainly no flapping wings. Even if there were crows, the dungeon was so 
far underground that there was no way of hearing them here. "What do you 
mean?" 

But Kaltain had already curled in on herself again, conserving as much 
warmth as she could. Celaena didn't want to think about how frigid the cell 
must be at night; she knew what it felt like to curl up like that, desperate for 
any kernel of warmth, wondering whether you'd wake up in the morning, or if 
the cold would claim you before then. 

Not giving herself the time to reconsider, Celaena unfastened her black 
cloak. She threw it through the bars, aiming carefully to avoid the long-dried 
vomit that was caked onto the stones. She'd also heard about the girl's opium 
addiction--being locked away without a fix had to have driven her close to 
insanity, if she wasn't mad to begin with. 

Kaltain stared at the cloak that landed in her lap, and Celaena pivoted to 
return down the narrow, icy corridor and up to the warmer levels above. 


"Sometimes," Kaltain said softly, and Celaena paused. "Sometimes I think 
they brought me here. Not to marry Perrington, but for another purpose. They 
want to use me." 

"Use you for what?" 

"They never say. When they come down here, they never tell me what they 
want. I don't even remember. It's all just ... fragments. Shards of a broken 
mirror, each gleaming with its own individual image." 

She was mad. Celaena clamped down the urge to make a cutting remark, 
the memory of Kaltain's bruises staying her tongue. "Thank you for your 
help." 

Kaltain wrapped Celaena's cloak around herself. "Something is coming," 
she whispered. "And I am to greet it." 

Celaena loosed the breath she hadn't realized she'd been holding. This 
conversation was pointless. "Good-bye, Kaltain." 

The girl only laughed softly, and the sound followed Celaena long after 
she'd left the freezing dungeons behind. 


"Those bastards," Nehemia spat, clenching her teacup so hard Celaena 
thought the princess would shatter it. They sat together in her bed, a large 
breakfast tray spread between them. Fleetfoot watched their every bite, ready 
to devour any stray crumbs. "How could the guards just turn their backs like 
that? How can they keep her in such conditions? Kaltain is a member of the 
court--and if they treat her like that, then I can't begin to imagine how they 
treat criminals from the other classes." Nehemia paused, glancing 
apologetically at Celaena. 

Celaena shrugged and shook her head. After seeing Kaltain, she'd gone 
out to stalk Archer, but a snowstorm had struck, so fierce that visibility was 
nearly impossible. After an hour of trying to track him through the snow- 
swept city, she'd given up and come back to the castle. 

The storm had continued all night, leaving a blanket of snow too deep for 
Celaena to take her usual morning run with Chaol. So she'd invited Nehemia 
to join her for breakfast in bed, and the princess--who was now thoroughly 
sick of snow--was more than happy to dash to Celaena's rooms and hop 
under the warm covers. 


Nehemia set down her tea. "You have to tell Captain Westfall about how 
she's being treated." 

Celaena finished her scone and leaned back in her fluffed-up pillows. "I 
already did. He dealt with it." No need to mention that after Chaol had 
returned to his bedroom, where Celaena had been reading, his tunic was 
rumpled, his knuckles were raw, and there was a deadly sort of gleam in his 
chestnut eyes that told Celaena the dungeon guard was going to have some 
serious changes--and new members. 

"You know," Nehemia mused, using her foot to gently shove Fleetfoot 
away as the dog tried to snatch some food off their tray, "the courts weren't 
always like this. There was a time when people valued honor and loyalty-- 
when serving a ruler wasn't about obedience and fear." She shook her head, 
her gold-tipped braids tinkling. In the early morning sun, her hazelnut skin 
was smooth and lovely. Honestly, it was a tad unfair that Nehemia naturally 
looked so beautiful--especially at the crack of dawn. 

Nehemia went on. "I think such honor faded from Adarlan generations 
ago, but before Terrasen fell, its royal court was the one that set the example. 
My father used to tell me stories of Terrasen's court--of the warriors and 
lords who served King Orlon in his inner circle, of the unrivaled power and 
bravery and loyalty of his court. That was why the King of Adarlan targeted 
Terrasen first. Because it was the strongest, and because if Terrasen had been 
given the chance to raise an army against him, Adarlan would have been 
annihilated. My father still says that if Terrasen were to rise again, it might 
stand a chance; it would be a genuine threat to Adarlan." 

Celaena looked toward the hearth. "I know," she managed to get out. 

Nehemia turned to look at her. "Do you think another court like that could 
ever rise again? Not just in Terrasen, but anywhere? I've heard the court in 
Wendlyn still follows the old ways, but they're across the ocean, and do us 
no good. They looked in the other direction while the king enslaved our 
lands, and they still refuse all calls for aid." 

Celaena forced herself to snort, to wave her hand in dismissal. "This is an 
awfully heavy discussion for breakfast." She filled her mouth with toast. 
When she dared a glance at the princess, Nehemia's expression remained 
contemplative. "Any news about the king?" 

Nehemia clicked her tongue. "Only that he's added that little grub, Roland, 
to his council, and Roland seems to have been given the task of handling me. 


Apparently, Pve been too pushy with Minister Mullison, the councilman 
responsible for dealing with Calaculla's labor camp. Roland is supposed to 
placate me." 

"T can't tell who I feel worse for: you or Roland." 

Nehemia jabbed her in the side, and Celaena chuckled, batting her hand 
away. Fleetfoot used their temporary distraction to swipe a piece of bacon 
right off the platter, and Celaena squawked. "You brazen thief!" 

But Fleetfoot leapt off the bed, scuttled to the hearth, and stared right at 
Celaena as she gobbled down the rest of the bacon. 

Nehemia laughed, and Celaena found herself joining in before she tossed 
Fleetfoot another piece of bacon. "Let's just stay in bed all day," Celaena 
said, throwing herself back onto the pillows and nestling into the blankets. 

"I certainly wish I could," Nehemia said, sighing loudly. "Alas, I have 
things to do." 

And so did she, Celaena realized. Like preparing for her dinner that 
evening with Archer. 


Chapter 10 


Dorian shivered as he entered the kennels that afternoon, brushing snow from 
his red cloak. Beside him, Chaol puffed air into his cupped hands, and the 
two young men hurried farther inside, the straw-coated floors crunching 
underfoot. Dorian hated winter--the intolerable cold and the way his boots 
never seemed completely dry. 

They had chosen to enter the castle through the kennels because it was the 
easiest way to avoid Hollin, Dorian's ten-year-old brother, who had returned 
from school that morning and was already shrieking demands at anyone 
unfortunate enough to cross his path. Hollin would never look for them here. 
He hated animals. 

They strode through the chorus of barking and whining, Dorian pausing 
every now and then to greet a favorite hound. He could have spent the rest of 
the day here--if only to avoid the court dinner in honor of Hollin. "I can't 
believe my mother pulled him out of school," he muttered. 

"She missed her son," Chaol said, still rubbing his hands together, though 
the kennels were deliciously warm compared to outside. "And now that 
there's this movement growing against your father, he wants Hollin where we 
can keep an eye on him until it gets sorted out." 

Until Celaena kills all the traitors, was what Chaol didn't need to say. 

Dorian sighed. "I don't even want to imagine what sort of absurd gift my 
mother bought him. Do you remember the last one?" 

Chaol grinned. It was hard not to remember the last gift Georgina had 
bought her younger son: four white ponies with a tiny golden carriage for 
Hollin to drive about himself. He'd trampled half of the queen's favorite 
garden. 

Chaol led them toward the doors at the far end of the kennels. "You can't 
avoid him forever." Even as the captain spoke, Dorian could see him 
scanning, as he always did, for any sign of danger, any threat. After so many 
years, Dorian was used to it, but it still rankled his pride a little. 

They passed through the glass doors and into the castle. To Dorian, the 
hall was warm and glowing; wreaths and garlands of evergreen still 


decorated archways and tabletops. To Chaol, he supposed, an enemy could 
be waiting anywhere. 

"Maybe he's changed in the past few months--amatured a little," Chaol 
said. 

"You said that last summer, and I almost punched his teeth out." 

Chaol shook his head. "Thank the Wyrd my brother was always too afraid 
of me to talk back." 

Dorian tried not to look surprised. Since Chaol had abdicated his title as 
heir of Anielle, he hadn't seen his family in years, and rarely spoke about 
them. 

Dorian could have gleefully killed Chaol's father for disowning him, 
refusing even to see Chaol when he brought his family to Rifthold for an 
important meeting with the king. Even though Chaol had never said it, Dorian 
knew the scars went deep. 

Dorian sighed loudly. "Remind me again why I'm going to this dinner 
tonight?" 

"Because your father will kill you and me if you don't show up and 
formally greet your brother." 

"Maybe he'd hire Celaena to do it." 

"She has dinner plans tonight. With Archer Finn." 

"Isn't she supposed to kill him?" 

"She wants information, apparently." A heavy pause. "I don't like him." 

Dorian stiffened. They had managed, at least for the afternoon, to not talk 
about her--and for those few hours, it had been like nothing had ever 
changed between them. But things had changed. "I don't think you need to 
worry about Archer stealing her away--especially if he's going to be dead 
by the end of the month." It came out sharper and colder than he intended. 

Chaol cut a glance at him. "You think that's what Pm worried about?" 

Yes. And its obvious to everyone except the two of you. 

But he didn't want to have this conversation with Chaol, and Chaol sure 
as hell didn't want to have this conversation with him, so Dorian just 
shrugged. "She'll be fine, and you'll laugh at yourself for worrying. Even if 
he's as well-guarded as she claims, she's the Champion for a reason, right?" 

Chaol nodded, though Dorian could still see the worry in his eyes. 


Celaena knew the scarlet dress was a little scandalous. And she knew that it 
was definitely not appropriate for winter, given how low the front dipped, 
and how much lower the back went. Low enough to reveal through the black 
lace mesh that she wasn't wearing a corset beneath it. 

But Archer Finn had always liked women who were daring with their 
clothes, who were ahead of the trend. And this dress, with its close-fitting 
bodice, long, tight sleeves, and gently flowing skirt, was about as new and 
different as it came. 

Which was why, when she ran into Chaol on her way out of her rooms, 
she wasn't very surprised when he stopped dead and blinked. Then blinked 
again. 

Celaena smiled at him. "Hello to you, too." 

Chaol stood in the hallway, his bronze eyes traveling down the front of her 
dress, then up again. "You're not wearing that." 

She snorted and walked past him, deliberately giving him a view of the 
far more provocative back. "Oh, yes. I am." 

Chaol fell into step beside her as she made her way down to the front gate 
and the waiting carriage. "You're going to catch your death." 

She slung her ermine cloak around her. "Not with this, I won't." 

"Do you even have any weapons with you?" 

She stomped down the main staircase that led to the entrance hall. "Yes, 
Chaol, I have weapons. And I'm wearing this dress because I want Archer to 
ask the same thing. To think I don't have any on me." 

There were indeed knives strapped to her legs, and the pins sweeping her 
hair into a curling cascade down one shoulder were long and razor-sharp-- 
commissioned, to her delight, by Philippa, so she didn't need to "go traipsing 
around with cold metal jammed between your breasts." 

"Oh," was all Chaol said. They reached the main entrance in silence, and 
Celaena slipped on her kid gloves as they neared the towering double doors 
that opened onto the courtyard. She was just about to walk down the front 
steps when Chaol touched her shoulder. 

"Be careful," he said, examining the carriage, the driver, the footman. 
They seemed to pass inspection. "Don't put yourself at risk." 

"I do this for a living, you know." She never should have told him about 
her capture, never should have let him see her as vulnerable, because now 
he'd just worry about her and doubt her and irritate her to no end. She didn't 


know why she did it, but she shook off his touch and hissed, "Ill see you 
tomorrow." 

He stiffened as if he'd been struck, his teeth flashing. "What do you mean, 
tomorrow?" 

Again, that stupid, bright anger took over, and she gave hima slow smile. 
"Youre a smart boy," she said, stalking down the steps to the carriage. 
"Figure it out yourself." 

Chaol kept staring as though he didn't know her, his body so very still. 
She wouldn't have him thinking her vulnerable, or foolish, or inexperienced 
--not when she'd worked so hard and sacrificed so much to get to this point. 
Maybe it had been a mistake to let him in; because the idea of him thinking 
that she was weak, that she needed to be protected, made her want to shatter 
someone's bones. 

"Good night," she said, and before she could reconsider all that she'd just 
implied, she got into the carriage and drove away. 

She'd worry about Chaol later. Tonight, her focus was on Archer--and on 
getting the truth out of him. 


Archer was waiting inside an exclusive dining room, frequented by the elite 
of Rifthold. Most of the tables were already occupied, the patrons' fine 
clothes and jewels glimmering in the dim light. 

As the servant at the front helped her out of her cloak, she made sure that 
she was angled away from Archer--so he could get an eyeful of the exquisite 
black lace that covered the open back (and mostly concealed her scars from 
Endovier). She felt the eyes of the servant on her, too, but pretended not to 
notice. 

Archer let out a breath, and she turned to find him grinning, slowly 
shaking his head. 

"I think 'stunning,' 'beautiful,' and 'dazzling' are the words you're 
looking for," she said. She took his arm as they were escorted to a table 
tucked into an alcove of the ornate room. 

Archer ran a finger along the red velvet sleeve of her gown. "I'm glad to 
see your taste matured along with the rest of you. And with your arrogance, it 
seems." 

She would have smiled anyway, she told herself: 


Once they were seated, had the menu recited to them, and ordered the 
wine, Celaena found herself staring into that exquisite face. "So," she said, 
leaning back in her seat, "how many ladies want to kill me tonight for 
monopolizing your time?" 

He gave a laugh like a tickle of breath. "If I told you, you'd be bolting 
back to the castle." 

"Youre still that popular?" 

Archer waved a hand, taking a sip from his wine. "I still have my debts to 
Clarisse," he said, naming the most influential and prosperous madam in the 
capital. "But ... yes." A twinkle gleamed in his eye. "And what of your surly 
friend? Should I watch my back tonight, too?" 

This was all a dance, a prelude to what would come later. She winked at 
him. "He knows better than to try to keep me locked up." 

"Wyrd help the man who does. I still remember what a hellion you were." 

"And here I was thinking you found me charming." 

"Tn the way a mountain cat's cub is charming, I suppose." 

She laughed and drank a small sip of her wine. She had to keep her head 
as clear as possible. When she set her glass on the table, she found Archer 
giving her that contemplative, sad look he'd given her yesterday. "Can I ask 
how you came to work for him?" She knew he meant the king--and also 
knew he was aware they weren't the only people in the dining room. He 
would have made a good assassin. 

Perhaps the king's suspicions weren't so far-fetched. 

But she'd prepared for this question and countless others, so she gave him 
a wicked smile and said, "Turns out my skills are better suited to aiding the 
empire than they are to mining. Working for him and working for Arobynn are 
nearly the same." That wasn't a lie, actually. 

Archer gave a slow, considering nod. "Our professions have always been 
similar, yours and mine. I can't tell which is worse: training us for the 
bedroom, or the battlefield." 

If she recalled correctly, he'd been twelve when Clarisse had discovered 
him as an orphan running wild in the capital's streets and invited him to train 
with her. 

And when he turned seventeen and had the Bidding Party for his virginity, 
there had been rumors of actual brawls breaking out among would-be 
patronesses. 


"I can't tell, either. They're equally horrible, I suppose." She lifted her 
wine glass in a toast. "To our esteemed owners." 

His eyes lingered on her for a moment before he lifted his glass and 
murmured, "To us." The sound of his voice was enough to make her skin 
heat, but the look in his eyes as he said it, the curve of that divine mouth ... 
He was a weapon, too. A beautiful, deadly weapon. 

He leaned over the edge of the table, pinning her to the spot with his stare. 
A challenge--and an intimate invitation. 

Gods above and Wyrd save me. 

She actually needed to take a long sip from her wine this time. "It's going 
to take more than a few sultry glances to make me your willing slave, Archer. 
You should know better than to try the tricks of your trade on me." 

He let out a low, rumbling laugh that she felt in her core. "And I think you 
know well enough to realize when I'm not actually using them. If I were, then 
we would have left the restaurant already." 

"That's a bold, bold claim. I don't think you'd want to go head-to-head 
with me when it comes to tricks of the trade." 

"Oh, I want to do a lot of things with you." 

She'd never been so grateful to see a servant in her life, and never 
realized that a bowl of soup could be so immensely interesting. 


Since she'd dismissed her carriage just to spite Chaol and back up her 
insinuation, Celaena wound up in Archer's carriage after dinner. The meal 
itself had been pleasant enough--talk of old acquaintances, the theater, 
books, the miserable weather. All comfortable, safe topics, though he'd kept 
looking at her like she was his prey and this was one long hunt. 

They sat beside each other on the bench of the carriage, close enough that 
she could smell whatever fine cologne he wore--an elegant, tantalizing 
blend that made her think of silk sheets and candlelight. So she turned her 
mind to what she was about to do. 

The carriage rolled to a stop, and Celaena glanced out the small window 
to see a familiar, beautiful townhouse. Archer looked at her and gently 
twined her fingers with his before raising her hand to his lips. It was a soft, 
slow kiss that burned through her. He murmured onto her skin. "Do you want 
to come inside?" 


She swallowed hard. "Don't you want a night off?" This was not what 
she'd expected. And ... and this was not what she wanted, flirting aside. 

He lifted his head but still held her hand, his thumb caressing small 
circles into her flame-hot skin. "It's immensely different when it's my choice, 
you know." 

Someone else might have missed it, but she'd also grown up without 
choices, and recognized the glimmer of bitterness. She eased her hand out of 
his. "Do you hate your life?" Her words were barely more than a whisper. 

He looked at her--truly looked at her, as though he somehow hadn't seen 
her until just now. "Sometimes," he said, and then his eyes shifted to the 
window behind her and the townhouse beyond it. "But someday," he went on, 
"someday, P11 have enough money to pay off Clarisse forever--to really be 
free--and live on my own." 

"You'd leave behind being a courtesan?" 

He gave her a half smile that was more real than any expression she'd 
seen him give tonight. "By that point, P' 11 either be rich enough that I won't 
ever have to work, or old enough that no one will want to hire me." 

She had a flicker of memory from a time when, just for a moment, she'd 
been free; when the world had been wide open and she'd been about to enter 
it with Sam at her side. It was a freedom that she was still working for, 
because even though she'd tasted it only for a heartbeat, it had been the most 
exquisite heartbeat she'd ever experienced. 

She took a steadying breath and looked him in the eye. It was time. 

"The king sent me to kill you." 








Chapter 11 


His training with the assassins must have paid off, because Archer was 
across the carriage and brandishing a hidden dagger between them before she 
could blink. "Please," he breathed, his chest rising and falling in uneven 
patterns. "Please, Laena." She opened her mouth, ready to explain 
everything, but he was gasping down breaths, his eyes wide. "I can pay you." 

A small, wretched part of her was fairly smug at the sight of him 
cowering. But she held up her hands, showing him she was unarmed--at 
least as far as he could see. "The king thinks you're part of a rebel movement 
that's interrupting his agenda." 

A harsh, barked laugh--so raw that none of the smooth, lovely man was 
even recognizable in the sound. "I'm not part of any movement! Wyrd damn 
me, I might be a whore, but I'm not a traitor!" She kept her hands where he 
could see them, and opened her mouth to tell him to shut up, sit down, and 
listen. But he went on. "I don't know anything about a movement like that--I 
haven't even heard of anyone who'd dare try to get in the way of the king. 
But--but ..." His panting evened out. "If you spare me, I can feed you 
information about a group that I know is starting to gather power in Rifthold." 

"The king is targeting the wrong people?" 

"T don't know," he said quickly, "but this group ... this one, he'd probably 
want to know more about. It seems like they recently learned that the king 
might be planning some new horror for us all--and they want to try to stop 

If she were a nice, decent person, she'd tell him to take the time to calm 
himself, to right his mind. But she wasn't a nice, decent person, and his panic 
was giving his tongue free rein, so she let him go on. 

"Pve only heard my clients whispering about it, every now and then. But 
there's a group that's formed, right here in Rifthold, and they want to put 
Aelin Galathynius back on Terrasen's throne." 

Her heart stopped beating. Aelin Galathynius, the lost heir of Terrasen. 

"Aelin Galathynius is dead," she breathed. 

Archer shook his head. "They don't think so. They say she's alive, and 
that she's raising an army against the king. She's looking to reestablish her 


court, to find what's left of King Orlon's inner circle." 

She just stared at him, willing her fingers to unclench, willing air into her 
lungs. If it were true ... No, it wasn't true. If these people actually claimed to 
have met the heir to the throne, then she had to be an imposter. 

Was it mere coincidence that Nehemia had mentioned Terrasen's court that 
morning? That Terrasen was the one force capable of standing against the 
king--if it could get to its feet again, with or without the true heir? But 
Nehemia had sworn to never lie to her; if she'd known anything, she would 
have said it. 

Celaena closed her eyes, though she was aware of Archer's every 
movement. In the darkness, she pulled herself together, shoved down that 
desperate, foolish hope until nothing but an ageless fear blanketed it again. 

She opened her eyes. Archer was gaping at her, his face white as death. 

"I have no intention of killing you, Archer," she said. He sagged against 
the bench, releasing his grip on the dagger. "I'm going to give you a choice. 
You can fake your own death right now and flee the city before dawn. Or I 
can give you until the end of the month--four weeks. Four weeks to 
discreetly get your affairs in order; I assume you have money tied up in 
Rifthold. But the time comes at a cost: P11 keep you alive only if you can get 
me information about whatever this Terrasen rebel movement is--and 
whatever they know about the king's plans. At the end of the month, you will 
fake your death, and you will leave this city, go someplace far away, and 
never use the name Archer Finn again." 

He stared carefully, warily, at her. "P1 need the rest of the month to 
untangle my money." He loosed a breath, then rubbed his face with his hands. 
After a long moment, he said, "Perhaps this is a blessing in disguise. I'll get 
to be free of Clarisse and start my life anew elsewhere." Though he gave her 
a wobbly smile, his eyes were still haunted. "Why did the king even suspect 
me?" 

She hated herself for feeling such pity for him. "I don't know. He just 
handed me a piece of paper with your name on it, and said you were a part of 
some movement to upset his plans--whatever those may be." 

Archer snorted. "I only wish I could be that sort of man." 

She studied him: the strong jaw, the broad frame, all suggested strength. 
But what she'd seen just now--that was not strength. Chaol had known right 
away what sort of man Archer was. Chaol had seen through the illusion of 


strength--and she hadn't. Shame heated her cheeks, but she made herself 
speak again. "You truly think you can uncover information about this--this 
movement from Terrasen?" Even though the heir had to be an imposter, the 
movement itself was worth looking into. Elena had said to look for clues; she 
might find some here. 

Archer nodded. "There's a ball tomorrow night at a client's house; I've 
heard him and his friends murmuring about the movement. If I sneak you into 
the party, it might give you a chance to look around his office. Maybe you'll 
even find real traitors at the party--not just suspects." 

And some ideas about what the king might be up to. Oh, this information 
could be very useful. 

"Send along the details to the castle tomorrow morning, care of Lillian 
Gordaina," she told him. "But if this party turns out to be a load of nonsense, 
Pll reconsider my offer. Don't make me look the fool, Archer." 

"Youre Arobynn's protegee," he said quietly, opening the carriage door 
and keeping his distance as best he could while he exited. "I wouldn't dare." 

"Good," she said. "And Archer?" He paused, a hand on the carriage door. 
She leaned forward, letting a bit of that wicked darkness shine through her 
eyes. "If I find out that you aren't being discreet--if you draw too much 
attention to yourself or attempt to flee--I will end you. Is that clear?" 

He gave her a low bow. "I am your eternal servant, milady." And then he 
gave her a smile that made her wonder whether she'd regret her decision to 
let him live. Leaning into the carriage bench, she thumped on the ceiling, and 
the driver headed to the castle. Though she was exhausted, she had one last 
thing to do before bed. 


She knocked once, then opened the door to Chaol's bedroom just wide 
enough to peer in. He was standing frozen before the fireplace, as if he'd 
been in the middle of pacing. 

"I thought you'd be asleep," she said, slipping inside. "It's past twelve." 

He folded his arms across his chest, his captain's uniform rumpled and 
unbuttoned at the collar. "Then why bother stopping by? I thought you weren't 
coming home tonight, anyway." 

She pulled her cloak tighter around her, her fingers digging into the soft 
fur. She lifted her chin. "Turns out Archer wasn't as dashing as I 


remembered. Funny how a year in Endovier can change the way you see 
people." 

His lips tugged upward, but his face remained solemn. "Did you get the 
information you wanted?" 

"Yes, and then some," she said. She explained what Archer had told her 
(pretending that he'd accidentally given her the information, of course). She 
explained the rumors surrounding the lost heir of Terrasen, but left out the 
bits about Aelin Galathynius seeking to reestablish her court and raise an 
army. And about Archer not really being in the movement. Oh, and about 
wanting to uncover the king's true plans. 

When she finished telling Chaol about the upcoming ball, he walked up to 
the mantel and braced his hands against it, staring at the tapestry hanging on 
the wall above. Though it was faded and worn, she instantly recognized the 
ancient city nestled into the side of a mountain above a silver lake: Anielle, 
Chaol's home. 

"When are you going to tell the king?" he asked, turning his head to look at 
her. 

"Not until I know if this is actually real 
much information as I can before I kill him." 

He nodded, pushing off the mantel. "Just be careful." 

"You keep saying that." 

"Is there something wrong with saying it?" 

"Yes, there is! I'm not some silly fool who can't protect herself or use her 
head!" 

"Did I ever imply that?" 

"No, but you keep saying 'be careful' and telling me how you worry, and 
insisting you help me with things, and--" 

"Because I do worry!" 

"Well, you shouldn't! Pm just as capable of looking after myself as you 
are!" 

He took a step toward her, but she held her ground. "Believe me, 
Celaena," he snarled, his eyes flashing, "I know you can look after yourself. 
But I worry because I care. Gods help me, I know I shouldn't, but I do. So I 
will always tell you to be careful, because I will always care what happens." 

She blinked. "Oh," was all she managed. 





or until I use Archer to get as 


He pinched the bridge of his nose and squeezed his eyes shut, then took a 
long, deep breath. 
Celaena gave hima sheepish smile. 


Chapter 12 


The masque was held in a riverfront estate along the Avery, and was so 
packed that Celaena had no trouble slipping in with Archer. Philippa had 
managed to find her a delicate white gown, made up of layers of chiffon and 
silk patterned like overlapping feathers. A matching mask obscured the upper 
half of her face, and ivory feathers and pearls had been woven into her hair. 

It was fortunate it was a masquerade and not a normal party, since she 
certainly recognized a few faces in the crowd. They were mostly other 
courtesans she'd once known, along with Madame Clarisse. During the 
carriage ride here, Archer had promised that Arobynn Hamel wasn't 
attending, and neither was Lysandra--a courtesan with whom Celaena had a 
long, violent history, and someone she was fairly certain she'd kill if she 
ever saw again. As it was, just seeing Clarisse floating through the party, 
arranging liaisons between her courtesans and the guests, was enough to set 
Celaena on edge. 

While she had come as a swan, Archer had dressed as a wolf--his tunic 
pewter, his slender pants dove gray, and his boots shining black. His wolf 
mask covered all but his sensual lips, which were currently parted in a rather 
wolfish smile as he squeezed the hand she had on his arm. 

"Not the grandest party we've ever been to," he said, "but Davis has the 
best pastry chef in Rifthold." 

Indeed, throughout the room, tables were overflowing with the most 
beautiful, decadent-looking pastries she'd ever seen. Pastries stuffed with 
cream, cookies dusted with sugar, and chocolate, chocolate, chocolate 
beckoning to her everywhere. Perhaps she'd swipe a few before she left. It 
was an effort to return her gaze to Archer. "How long has he been your 
client?" 

That wolfish smile flickered. "A few years now. Which is how I noticed 
the change in his behavior." His voice dropped to a whisper, the words 
tickling her ear as he leaned in. "He's more paranoid, eats less, and holes up 
in his office any chance he gets." 

At the other end of the domed ballroom, massive windows faced a patio 
overlooking a glittering stretch of the Avery. She could imagine those doors 


thrown wide in summer, and how lovely it would be to dance alongside the 
riverbank under the stars and city lights. 

"I have about five minutes before I need to make my rounds," Archer said, 
his eyes following Clarisse as she patrolled the room. "She'll expect an 
auction for me on a night like this." Celaena's stomach turned over, and she 
found herself reaching for his hand. But he just gave her a bemused smile. 
"Just a few more weeks, right?" There was still enough bitterness that she 
squeezed his fingers reassuringly. 

"Right," she swore. 

Archer jerked his chin toward a stocky, middle-aged man holding court 
with a group of well-dressed people. "That's Davis," he said under his 
breath. "I haven't seen much during my visits, but I think he might be a key 
leader in this group." 

"You're assuming that based on glimpsing some papers in the house?" 

Archer slid his hands into his pockets. "One night about two months ago, I 
was here when three of his friends came over--all of them clients of mine, 
too. It was urgent, they said, and when Davis slipped out of the bedroom..." 

She gave him a half smile. "You somehow accidentally overheard 
everything?" 

Archer smiled back, but it faded as he again looked at Davis, who was 
pouring wine for the people assembled around him, including some young 
women who looked a year or two shy of sixteen. Celaena's own smile 
vanished as well. This was a side of Rifthold that she hadn't missed in the 
least. 

"They spent more time ranting about the king than making plans. And 
regardless of what they might claim, I don't think they truly care about Aelin 
Galathynius. I think they just want to find a ruler who best serves their 
interests--and maybe they only want her to raise an army so their businesses 
can thrive during the war that would ensue. If they aid her, give her badly 
needed supplies ..." 

"Then she'd owe them. They want a puppet queen, not a true ruler." Of 
course--of course they would want something like that. "Are they even from 
Terrasen?" 

"No. Davis's family was, years ago, but he's spent his whole life in 
Rifthold. If he claims loyalty to Terrasen, it's only a half truth." 

She ground her teeth. "Self-serving bastards." 


Archer shrugged. "That may be true. But they've also rescued a good 
number of would-be victims from the king's gallows, apparently. The night 
his friends burst into the house, it was because they'd managed to save one of 
their informants from being interrogated by the king. They smuggled him out 
of Rifthold before dawn broke the next day." 

Did Chaol know about this? Given how he'd reacted to killing Cain, she 
didn't think torturing and hanging traitors were a part of his duties--or were 
even mentioned to him. Or Dorian, for that matter. 

But if Chaol wasn't in charge of interrogating possible traitors, then who 
was? Was this person the source who had given the king his latest list of 
traitors to the crown? Oh, there were too many things to consider, too many 
secrets and tangled webs. 

Celaena asked, "Do you think you can get me into Davis's office right 
now? I want to look around." 

Archer smirked. "My darling, why do you think I brought you over here?" 
He smoothly led her to a nearby side door--a servants' entrance. No one 
noticed as they slipped through, and if they had, Archer's hands roaming over 
her bodice, her arms, her shoulders, her neck, would suggest that they were 
going through the door for some privacy. 

A seductive smile on his face, Archer tugged her down the small hallway, 
then up the stairs, always taking care to keep his hands moving on her lest 
anyone see them. But all the servants were preoccupied, and the upstairs hall 
was clear and quiet, its wood-paneled walls and red carpeting immaculate. 
The paintings here--several from artists she recognized--were worth a 
small fortune. Archer moved with a stealth that probably came from years of 
slipping in and out of bedrooms. He led her to a set of locked double doors. 

Before she could pull one of Philippa's pins from her hair to unlock it, a 
pick appeared in Archer's hand. He gave her a conspirator's grin. A 
heartbeat after that, the office door swung open, revealing a room lined with 
bookshelves over an ornate blue carpet, with potted ferns scattered 
throughout. A large desk sat in the center, two armchairs before it, and a 
chaise sprawled near a darkened fireplace. Celaena paused in the doorway, 
pressing on her bodice just to feel the slender dagger tucked inside. She 
brushed her legs together, checking the two daggers strapped to her thighs. 

"I should go downstairs," Archer said, glancing at the hallway behind 
them. The sounds of a waltz floated up from the ballroom. "Try to be quick." 


She raised an eyebrow, even though the mask covered her features. "Are 
you telling me how to do my job?" 

He leaned in, brushing his lips against her neck. "I wouldn't dream of it," 
he said onto her skin. Then he turned and was gone. 

Celaena quickly shut the door, then strode to the windows at the other side 
of the room and closed the curtains. The dim light shining beneath the door 
was enough to see by as she moved to the ironwood desk and lit a candle. 
The evening papers, a stack of response cards from tonight's masque, a 
personal expenses ledger ... 

Normal. Completely normal. She searched the rest of the desk, rifling 
through the drawers and knocking on every surface to check for trick 
compartments. When that yielded nothing, she walked to one of the 
bookcases, tapping the books to see whether any were hollowed out. She 
was about to turn away when a title caught her eye. 

A book with a single Wyrdmark written on the spine in bloodred ink. 

She pulled it out and rushed to the desk, setting down the candle as she 
opened the book. 

It was full of Wyrdmarks--every page covered with them, and with words 
in a language she didn't recognize. Nehemia had said it was secret 
knowledge--that the Wyrdmarks were so old they'd been forgotten for 
centuries. Titles like this had been burned with the rest of the books on 
magic. She had found one in the palace library--The Walking Dead--but that 
had been a fluke. The art of using the Wyrdmarks was lost; only Nehemia's 
family knew how to properly use their power. But here, in her hands ... She 
flipped through the book. 

Someone had written a sentence on the inside of the back cover, and 
Celaena brought the candle closer as she peered at what had been scribbled. 

It was a riddle--or some strange turn of phrase: 


It is only with the eye that one can see rightly. 


But what in hell did it mean? And what was Davis, some half-corrupt 
businessman, doing with a book on Wyrdmarks, of all things? If he was trying 
to interfere with the king's plans ... For the sake of Erilea, she prayed the 
king had never even heard of Wyrdmarks. 


She memorized the riddle. She would write it down when she returned to 
the castle--maybe ask Nehemia if she knew what it meant. Or if she'd heard 
of Davis. Archer might have given her vital information, but he obviously 
didn't know everything. 

Fortunes had been broken upon the loss of magic; people who had made 
their living for years by harnessing its power were suddenly left with 
nothing. It seemed natural for them to seek out another source of power, even 
though the king had outlawed it. But what-- 

Footsteps sounded down the hall. Celaena swiftly put the book back on 
the shelf, then looked to the window. Her dress was too big, and the window 
too small and high, for her to easily make it out that way. And with no other 
exit ... 

The lock in the double doors clicked. 

Celaena leaned against the desk, whipping out her handkerchief, bowing 
her shoulders, and starting a miserable sniffle-sob as Davis entered his study. 

The short, solid man paused at the sight of her, the smile that had been on 
his face fading. Thankfully, he was alone. She popped up, doing her best to 
look embarrassed. "Oh!" she said, dabbing at her eyes with her kerchief 
through the holes in her mask. "Oh, I'm sorry, II needed a place to be alone 
for a moment and they s-s-said I could come in here." 

Davis's eyes narrowed, then shifted to the key in the lock. "How did you 
get in?" A smooth, slippery voice, dripping with calculation--and a hint of 
fear. 

She let out a shuddering sniffle. "The housekeeper." Hopefully, the poor 
woman wouldn't be flayed alive after this. Celaena hitched her voice, 
stumbling and rushing through the words. "My-my betrothed |-l-left m-me." 

Honestly, she sometimes wondered if there was something a bit wrong 
with her for being able to cry so easily. 

Davis took her in again, his lip curling--not out of sympathy, she realized, 
but from disgust at this silly, weepy woman sniffling about her fiance. As if it 
would be a colossal waste of his precious time to comfort a person in pain. 

The thought of Archer having to serve these people who looked at him 
like he was a toy to be used until he was broken ... She focused on her 
breathing. She just had to get out of here without raising Davis's suspicions. 
One word to the guards down the hall, and she'd be in more trouble than she 
wanted--and might possibly drag Archer down with her. 


She let out another shudder-sniffle. 

"There is a ladies' powder room on the first floor," Davis said, stepping 
toward her--to escort her out. Perfect. 

As he approached he pulled off the bird mask he wore, revealing a face 
that had probably been handsome in its youth. Age and too much drinking had 
pummeled it into saggy cheeks, thinning straw-blond hair, and a dull 
complexion. Capillaries had burst on the tip of his nose, staining it a 
purplish-red that offset his watery gray eyes. 

He stopped close enough to touch her and held out a hand. She dabbed at 
her eyes one more time, then slipped her handkerchief back into her dress 
pocket. "Thank you," she whispered, looking at the floor as she took his 
hand. "I--I am sorry for intruding." 

She heard his sudden intake of breath before she caught the flash of metal. 

She had him disabled and on the floor in a heartbeat--but not fast enough 
to avoid the sting of Davis's dagger slicing into her forearm. The yards of 
fabric that made up her dress were cumbersome as she pinned him to the 
carpet, a thin line of blood welling up and trickling down her bare arm. 

"No one has the keys to this study,' Davis hissed, despite his prone 
position. Brave, or foolish? "Not even my housekeeper." 

Celaena shifted her hand, going for the points in his neck that would 
render him unconscious. If she could hide her forearm, then she could still 
slip out of here unnoticed. 

"What were you looking for?" Davis demanded, his breath reeking of 
wine as he wriggled against her hold. She didn't bother to answer, and he 
surged up, trying to dislodge her. She slammed her weight into him, lifting 
her hand to deliver the blow. 

Then he chuckled softly. "Don't you want to know what was on that 
blade?" 

She could have ripped his face off with her fingernails for the silken smile 
he gave her. In a smooth, swift movement, she snatched up his dagger and 
sniffed. 

She'd never forget that musky smell, not in a thousand lifetimes: gloriella, 
a mild poison that caused hours of paralysis. It had been used the night she 
was captured to knock her down, to make her helpless to fight back as she 
was handed over to the king's men and thrown into the royal dungeons. 


Davis's smile turned triumphant. "Just enough to knock you out until my 
guards arrive--and bring you to a more private location." Where she'd be 
tortured, he didn't need to add. 

Bastard. 

How much had she been exposed to? The cut was shallow and short. But 
she knew the gloriella was already racing through her, just as it had on the 
days after she'd lain beside Sam's broken corpse, smelling the musky smoke 
still clinging to him. She had to go. Now. 

She shifted her free hand to knock him out, but her fingers felt brittle, 
disconnected; and despite being short, he was strong. Someone must have 
trained him, because in a too-fast movement he grabbed her wrists, twisting 
her to the ground. She slammed into the carpet so hard the air was knocked 
from her lungs, her head spun, and she lost her grip on the dagger. The 
gloriella was acting fast--too fast. She had to get out. 

A bolt of panic went through her, pure and undiluted. Her confounded 
dress got in the way, but she focused what little control remained on bringing 
up her legs and kicking--so hard he let go for a moment. 

"Bitch!" He lunged for her again, but she'd already grabbed his poisoned 
dagger. A heartbeat later, he was clutching his neck as his blood sprayed on 
her, on her dress, on her hands. 

He collapsed to the side, grasping at his throat as though he could hold it 
together, keep his life's blood from spewing. He was making a familiar 
gurgling noise, but Celaena didn't give him the mercy of ending it as she 
staggered to her feet. No, she didn't even give him a parting glance as she 
took the dagger and ripped the skirts of her gown up to her knees. A moment 
after that she was at his office window, studying the guards and parked 
carriages below, each thought fuzzier than the last as she climbed onto the 
ledge. 

She didn't know how she made it, or how long it took, but suddenly she 
was on the ground and sprinting toward the open front gate. 

The guards or footmen or servants started shouting. She was running-- 
running as fast as she could, losing control of her body with each heartbeat 
that pumped the gloriella through her. 

They were in the wealthy part of the city--near the Royal Theater--and 
she scanned the skyline, searching, searching for the glass castle. There! The 


glowing towers had never seemed more beautiful, more welcoming. She had 
to get back. 
Her vision blurring, Celaena gritted her teeth and ran. 


She had enough awareness to snatch a cloak off a drunk dozing on a corner 
and wipe the blood from her face, even though it took several tries to keep 
her hands steady as she ran. Once the cloak concealed her ruined dress, she 
made for the main gates of the castle grounds--where the guards recognized 
her, though the lights were too dim for them to look closely. The wound had 
been short and shallow; she could make it. She just had to get inside, get to 
safety ... 

But she stumbled on the winding road leading up to the castle, and her run 
turned into a staggering walk before she even got to the castle itself. She 
couldn't go in the front like this, not unless she wanted everyone to see--not 
unless she wanted everyone to know who was responsible for Davis's death. 

She swayed with every step as she made for a side entrance, where 
studded iron doors were left partially open to the night--the barracks. Not 
the best place to enter, but good enough. Maybe the guards would be discreet. 

One foot in front of the other. Just a little farther ... 

She didn't remember getting to the barracks doors, only the bite of the 
metal studs as she pushed them open. The light of the hall burned her eyes, 
but at least she was inside ... 

The door to the mess hall was open, and the sounds of laughter and 
clinking mugs floated toward her. Was she numb from the cold, or was it the 
gloriella taking over? 

She had to tell someone what antidote to give her--just tell someone ... 

One hand braced against the wall, the other holding her cloak tightly 
around her, she slipped past the mess hall, every breath lasting a lifetime. No 
one stopped her; no one even looked her way. 

There was one door down this hall that she had to reach--one room 
where she'd be safe. She kept her hand on the stone wall, counting the doors 
she passed. So close. Her cloak caught on the handle of a door as she passed 
by and ripped away. 

But she made it to that door, to the room where she'd be safe. Her fingers 
didn't quite feel the grain of the wood as she pushed against the door and 


swayed on the threshold. 

Bright light, a blur of wood and stone and paper ... and through the haze, a 
face she knew, gaping at her from behind a desk. 

A choked noise came out of her throat, and she looked down at herself 
long enough to see the blood covering her white dress, her arms, her hands. 
In the blood, she could see Davis, and the open gash across his throat. 
"Chaol," she moaned, seeking that familiar face again. 

But he was already running, smashing through his office. He bellowed her 
name as her knees buckled and she fell. She saw only the golden brown of 


his eyes and held on long enough to whisper, "Gloriella," before everything 
tilted and went black. 


Chapter 13 


It was one of the longest nights of Chaol's life. 

Every second had passed by with horrific clarity--every agonizing 
second as Celaena lay there on the floor of his office, her bodice covered in 
so much blood that he couldn't tell where she was bleeding. And with all the 
stupid layers of frills and pleats, he couldn't see the entry wounds. 

So he'd lost it. Utterly lost it. There was no thought in his head beyond a 
roaring panic as he shut the door, took out his hunting knife, and ripped open 
her dress right there. 

But there were no wounds, only a sheathed stiletto that clattered to the 
floor and a scratch on her forearm. With the dress ripped away, there was 
hardly any blood on her. And that's when the panic cleared enough for him to 
remember what she'd whispered: gloriella. 

A poison used to temporarily paralyze victims. 

Everything from then on became a series of steps: quietly summoning 
Ress; telling the young, talented guard to keep his mouth shut and to find 
whatever healers were closest; wrapping her in his cloak so no one could 
see the blood on her skin; scooping her up and carrying her to her rooms; 
barking orders at the healers; and finally pinning her down on the bed as they 
forced the antidote down her throat until she choked on it. Then the long, long 
hours spent holding her as she vomited, twisting her hair back, snarling at 
anyone who entered the room. 

When she was sleeping soundly at last, he sat by her, still watching over 
her as he sent Ress and his most trustworthy men into the city and warned 
them not to come back without answers. When they did return and told him 
about the businessman apparently murdered by his own poisoned dagger, 
Chaol pieced together enough of what had happened to be sure of one thing: 

He was glad Davis was dead. Because if Davis had survived, Chaol 
would have gone back to finish the job himself. 


Celaena awoke. 


Her mouth was bone dry and her head pounded, but she could move. She 
could wiggle her toes and her fingers, and she recognized the smell of the 
sheets well enough to know that she was in her bed, in her room, and that she 
was Safe. 

Her eyelids were heavy as she opened them, blinking away the blurriness 
that still lingered. Her stomach ached, but the gloriella had worn off. She 
looked to her left, as if she'd somehow known, even in sleep, where he was. 

Chaol dozed in the chair, his arms and legs sprawled out, his head tipped 
back, exposing the unbuttoned collar of his tunic and the strong column of his 
throat. From the angle of the sunlight, it was probably around dawn. 

"Chaol," she rasped. 

He was instantly awake and alert, leaning toward her as if he, too, always 
knew where she was. When he saw her, the hand that had lurched toward his 
sword relaxed. "You're awake," he said, his voice a dark rumble, laced with 
temper. "How are you feeling?" 

She looked at herself; someone had washed away the blood and put her in 
a nightgown. Just moving her head made everything spin. "Horrible," she 
admitted. 

He put his head in his hands, bracing his elbows on his knees. "Before 
you say anything else, just tell me this: did you kill Davis because you were 
snooping in his office, he caught you, and then cut you with a drugged 
blade?" A flash of teeth, a flicker of rage in those golden-brown eyes. 

Her insides twisted up at the memory, but she nodded. 

"Very well," he said, standing up. 

"Are you going to tell the king?" 

He crossed his arms, coming to the edge of the bed and staring down at 
her. "No." Again, that volatile temper burned in his eyes. "Because I don't 
feel like having to argue that you're still capable of spying without getting 
caught. My men will keep their mouths shut, too. But the next time you do 
anything like this, I am going to throw you in the dungeons." 

"For killing him?" 

"For scaring the hell out of me!" He ran his hands through his hair, pacing 
for a moment, then whirled, pointing at her. "Do you know what you looked 
like when you showed up?" 

"PII hazard a guess and say ... bad?" 


A flat stare. "If I hadn't burned your dress, Pd make you look at it right 
now." 

"You burned my dress?" 

He splayed his arms. "You want proof of what you did lying around?" 

"You could get in trouble for covering for me like this." 

"PII deal with it if it comes to that." 

"Oh? You'll deal with it?" 

He leaned over the bed, bracing his hands on the mattress as he snarled in 
her face. "Yes. PI deal with it." 

She gulped, but her mouth was so dry she had nothing to swallow. Beyond 
his anger, there was enough lingering fear in his eyes that she winced. "It was 
that bad?" 

He slumped onto the edge of the mattress. "You were sick. Really sick. 
We didn't know how much gloriella was in the wound, so the healers erred 
on the safe side and gave you a strong dose of the antidote--which caused 
you to spend a few hours with your head in a bucket." 

"I don't remember any of that. I barely remember getting back to the 
castle." 

He shook his head and stared at the wall. Dark smudges lay under his 
eyes, stubble coated his jaw, and utter exhaustion lined every inch of his 
body. He probably hadn't fallen asleep until a little while ago. 

She'd hardly known where she was going while the gloriella tore through 
her; all she'd known was that she had to get someplace safe. 

And somehow, she had wound up exactly where she knew she'd be safest. 


Chapter 14 


Celaena absolutely hated that it took a fair amount of courage to enter the 
royal library after coming upon that ... thing a few nights ago. And more than 
that, she hated that the encounter had turned her favorite place in the castle 
into something unknown and possibly deadly. 

She felt a little foolish as she shoved open the towering oak doors to the 
library, armed to the teeth--most of her weapons concealed from sight. No 
need to have someone start asking why the King's Champion was going into 
the library looking like she was walking onto a killing field. 

Not feeling at all inclined to go into Rifthold after last mght, she'd opted 
to spend the day digesting what she'd learned in Davis's office and searching 
for any connection between that book of Wyrdmarks and the king's plans. 
And since she'd only seen one hint of something being amiss in the castle ... 
Well, she'd steeled her nerve to try to learn what that thing had been looking 
for in the library. Or if there was any hint of where it had gone. 

The library looked as it had always had: dim, cavernous, achingly 
beautiful in its ancient stone architecture and endless corridors lined with 
books. And totally silent. 

She knew there were a few scholars and librarians about, but they mostly 
kept to their private studies. The size of the place was overwhelming; it was 
a castle in itself. 

What had that thing been doing here? 

She craned her head back to take in the two upper levels, both bordered 
with ornate railings. Iron chandeliers cast light and shadow throughout the 
main chamber in which she stood. She loved this room--loved the scattering 
of heavy tables and red velvet chairs, and the worn couches sprawled before 
massive hearths. 

Celaena paused beside the table she had always used when researching 
the Wyrdmarks--a table at which she'd spent hours with Chaol. 

Three levels that she could see. Plenty of places to hide on all of them-- 
rooms and alcoves and half-crumbling staircases. 

What about beneath this level? The library was probably too far away to 
connect to the tunnels attached to her rooms, but there could be more 


forgotten places beneath the castle. The polished marble floor gleamed under 
her feet. 

Chaol had said something once about a legend regarding a second library 
underground--in catacombs and tunnels. If she were doing something that she 
didn't want others to find out about, if she were some foul creature who 
needed a place to hide ... 

Maybe she was a fool for looking into it, but she had to know. Maybe this 
thing would be able to give her some clues as to what was going on in this 
castle. 

She headed for the nearest wall and was soon swallowed up in the gloom 
of the stacks. It took her a few minutes to reach the perimeter wall, which 
was interspersed with bookcases and chipped writing desks. She pulled a 
piece of chalk from her pocket and drew an 'X' on one of the desks. Most of 
the library would probably look the same after a while; it would be helpful 
to know when she'd made a full sweep of the perimeter. Even if it took her 
hours to cover it all. 

She passed stack after stack of books, some of the cases plain, some of 
them ornately carved. Sconces were few and far enough apart that she often 
had to take several steps in near darkness. The floor had turned from 
gleaming marble to ancient gray blocks, and the scrape of her boots against 
stone was the only sound. It felt as if it'd been the only sound for a thousand 
years. 

But someone must have come down this passageway to light the sconces. 
So if she became lost, she might not stay that way forever. 

Not that getting lost was a possibility, she reassured herself as the silence 
of the library became a living thing. She'd been trained to mark and 
remember pathways and exits and turns. She'd be fine. 

Odds were that she had to go as far back into the library as possible--to a 
place where even the scholars didn't bother going. 

There had been a day, she recalled--a day when she'd been poring over 
The Walking Dead, and she' d felt something under her boots. Chaol had later 
revealed that he'd been dragging his dagger along the floor to spook her, but 
the initial vibration had been ... different. 

Like someone drawing a claw along stone. 

Stop it, she told herself. Stop it now. Your imagination is absurd. It was 
just Chaol teasing you. 


She didn't know how long she'd been walking when she finally hit 
another wall: a corner. The bookcases here were all carved from ancient 
wood, their ends shaped into sentries--guards forever protecting the books 
held between them. It was here that the sconces ran out--and a glance down 
the back wall of the library revealed utter darkness. 

Thankfully, one of the scholars had left a torch beside the last sconce. It 
was small enough that it wouldn't burn the whole damn library down, but 
also too small to last long. 

She could end it now, and go back to her rooms to contemplate ways to 
pry information from Archer's clients. One wall had been explored--one 
wall that revealed nothing. She could do the back wall tomorrow. 

But she was here already. 

Celaena picked up the torch. 


Dorian jerked awake at the sound of a clock chiming, and found himself 
sweating despite the fierce cold in his bedroom. 

It was odd enough that he'd fallen asleep, but the frigid temperature was 
what struck him as most unusual. His windows were all sealed, his door 
shut. 

And yet his shallow breaths clouded in front of him. 

He sat up, his head aching. 

A mghtmare--of teeth and shadows and glinting daggers. Just a nightmare. 

Dorian shook his head, the temperature in the room already increasing. 
Perhaps it had only been a rogue draft. The nap was just the product of 
staying up too late last night; the nightmare probably triggered by hearing 
from Chaol about Celaena's encounter. 

He gritted his teeth. Her job wasn't without risk--and though he was 
furious about what had happened, he had a feeling she'd only push him away 
further if he yelled at her about it. 

Dorian shook off the last bit of the cold and walked to his dressing room 
to change his wrinkled tunic. As he turned, he could have sworn he caught a 
glimpse of a faint ring of frost around where his body had lain on the couch. 

But when he looked back to see it more fully, there was nothing there. 





Celaena heard a distant clock chime somewhere--and didn't quite believe it 
when she heard the time. She'd been here for three hours. Three hours. The 
back wall wasn't like the side wall; it dipped and curved and had closets and 
alcoves and little study rooms full of mice and dust. And just when she'd 
been about to draw an X on the wall and call it a day, she noticed the 
tapestry. 

She saw it only because it was the sole bit of decoration she'd 
encountered along the wall. Considering how the last six months of her life 
had gone, part of her just knew that it had to mean something. 

There was no depiction of Elena, or a stag, or anything lovely and green. 

No; this tapestry, woven from red thread so dark it looked black, depicted 
... nothing. 

She touched the ancient strands, marveling at the hue, so deep that it 
seemed to swallow her fingers in its darkness. The hair on the back of her 
neck rose, and Celaena put a hand on her dagger as she pulled the tapestry 
aside. She swore. And swore again. 

Another secret door greeted her. 

Glancing around the stacks, listening for any footsteps or rustle of 
clothing, Celaena pushed it open. 

A breeze, musty and thick, floated past her from the depths of the spiral 
stairwell revealed by the open door. The light of her torch reached only a 
few feet inside, illuminating ornately carved walls depicting a battle. 

There was a thin groove in the marble wall, a channel barely three inches 
deep. It curved along the entire length of the wall, extending beyond the 
limits of her sight. She swiped her finger in the groove; it was smooth as 
glass and held a faint residue of something slimy. 

A small silver lamp hung from the wall, and she put her torch in its place 
as she took down the lamp, liquid splashing inside. "Clever," she murmured. 

Smiling to herself, making sure her torch was far enough away, Celaena 
placed the slender nozzle of the lamp into the groove and tipped. Oil poured 
out and traveled down the chute. Celaena grabbed her torch and touched it to 
the wall. Instantly, the groove glowed with fire, providing a thin line of light 
all the way down the dark and cobwebbed stairwell. A hand on her hip, she 
stared down, admiring the engraved surface of the walls. 

She doubted anyone would come looking for her, but she still put the 
tapestry back into its original position and took out one of her long daggers. 


As she descended, the images of battle shifted and moved in the firelight, and 
she could have sworn that the stone faces turned to watch her go. She stopped 
looking at the walls. 

A breath of cold air brushed her face, and she at last spied the bottom of 
the stair. It was a dark corridor that smelled of aged and rotting things. A 
torch lay discarded at the bottom of the step, covered with enough cobwebs 
to reveal that no one had been down here in a long, long time. 

Unless that thing can see in the dark. 

She shoved away that thought, too, and picked up the torch, igniting it on 
the illuminated wall of the stairwell. 

Cobwebs hung from the arched ceiling, grazing over the cobblestone 
floor. Rickety bookcases lined the halfway, the shelves crammed full of 
books so worn that Celaena couldn't read the titles. Scrolls and pieces of 
parchment were stuffed into every nook and cranny or lay unrolled on the 
sagging wood, as if someone had just walked away from reading them. 
Somehow, it was more of a tomb than Elena's resting place. 

She walked down the corridor, stopping occasionally to examine the 
scrolls. They were maps and receipts from kings long since turned to dust. 

Castle records. All this walking and fretting, and all you've discovered 
is useless castle records. That's probably what that creature was after: an 
ancient kings grocery bill. 

Beginning a chant of truly despicable curses, Celaena waved her torch 
before her and walked on until a hallway appeared on the left. 

It had to lead even lower than Elena's tomb--but how deep? There was a 
lantern and a groove in the wall, so Celaena once again lit the spiraling 
passage. This time, the gray stone depicted a forest. A forest, and-- 

Fae. It was impossible to miss those delicately pointed ears and 
elongated canines. The Fae lounged and danced and played music, content to 
bask in their immortality and ethereal beauty. 

No, the king and his cronies couldn t know about this place, because they 
certainly would have defaced these carvings by now. Celaena didn't need a 
historian to know that this stairwell was old--far older than the one through 
which she had just descended, perhaps even older than the castle itself. 

Why had Gavin picked this site to build his castle? Had there been 
something here before? 

Or something beneath it worth hiding? 


A cold sweat slithered down her spine as she peered into the stairwell. 
Against all odds, another breeze wafted up from below. Iron. It smelled like 
iron. 

The images on the walls flickered as she descended the spiral staircase. 
When she at last reached the bottom, she took a shallow breath and ignited a 
torch from a nearby bracket. She was in a long hallway paved in gray stones. 
There was only one door in the center of the left-hand wall, and no exit save 
for the stairs behind her. 

She scanned the hall. Nothing. Not even a mouse. After observing for 
another moment, she stepped down it, igniting the few torches on the wall as 
she went. 

The iron door was unremarkable, though undeniably impenetrable. Its 
studded surface was like a slab of starless sky. 

Celaena stretched out a hand, but stopped before her fingers could graze 
the metal. 

Why was it made entirely of iron? 

Iron was the one element immune to magic; she remembered that much. 
There had been so many kinds of magic-wielders ten years ago--people 
whose power was believed by some to have long ago originated from the 
gods themselves, despite the King of Adarlan's claim that magic was an 
affront to the divine. Wherever it came from, magic had countless variations: 
abilities to heal, to shape-shift, to summon flame or water or storm, to 
encourage the growth of crops and plants, to glimpse the future, and on and 
on. Most of those gifts had been watered down over the millennia, but for 
some rare strong ones, when they held on to their power too long, the iron in 
their blood caused fainting spells. Or worse. 

She had seen hundreds of doors in the castle--doors of wood, of bronze, 
of glass--but never one of solid iron. This one was ancient, from a time 
when an iron door meant something. So was this supposed to keep someone 
out--or to keep something in? 

Celaena touched the Eye of Elena, scanning the door again. It yielded no 
answers about what might be behind it, so she clamped a hand around the 
handle and pulled. 

It was locked. There was no keyhole in sight. She ran a hand along the 
grooves. Perhaps it had rusted shut? 

She frowned. No sign of rust, either. 


Celaena stepped back, studying the door. Why put a handle on it if there 
was no way of opening it? And why use a lock unless there was something 
worthwhile hidden behind it? 

She turned away, but the amulet warmed against her skin, and a flicker of 
light shone through her tunic. Celaena paused. 

It could have been the flicker of the torch, but ... Celaena studied the 
slender gap between the door and the stone. A shadow--darker than the 
blackness beyond--lingered on the other side. 

Slowly, drawing out her thinnest and flattest dagger with her free hand, 
she set the torch down and lay on her stomach, as close to the door as she 
dared. Just shadows--it was just shadows. Or rats. 

Either way, she had to know. 

With absolute silence, she slid the shining dagger under the door. The 
reflection along the blade revealed nothing but darkness--darkness and 
torchlight. 

She shifted the dagger, pushing it just a bit farther beneath. 

Two gleaming, green-gold orbs flashed in the shadows beyond. 

She lunged back, swiping the dagger with her, biting down on her lip to 
keep from cursing aloud. Eyes. Eyes gleaming in the dark--eyes like an ... 
an... 

She sighed through her nose, relaxing slightly. Eyes like an animal. Like a 
rat. Or a mouse. Or some feral cat. 

Still, she crept forward again, holding her breath as she angled the blade 
under the door to scan the darkness. 

Nothing. Absolutely nothing. 

She watched the dagger's blade for a full minute, waiting for those eyes to 
reappear. 

But whatever it was had scuttled off. 

A rat. It was probably a rat. 

Still, Celaena couldn't shake the chill that had wrapped around her, or 
ignore the warmth of the amulet at her neck. Even if there wasn't a creature 
behind that door, answers lay behind it. And she'd find them--yust not today. 
Not until she was ready. 

Because there might be ways to get through that door. And considering 
how old this place was, she had a feeling that the power that had sealed it 
was connected to the Wyrdmarks. 


But if there was something behind the door ... She shifted the fingers of 
her right hand as she picked up her torch, studying the arc of scars left by the 
ridderak's bite. 

It was just a rat. And she had no interest--none--in being proven wrong 
right now. 


Chapter 15 


The Great Hall was packed at dinner that night. Though Celaena usually 
preferred to eat in her rooms, when she heard that Rena Goldsmith would be 
performing during the meal to honor Prince Hollin's return, she crammed 
herself into one of the long tables in the back. It was the only place where the 
lesser nobility, some of Chaol's higher-born men, and any others who wanted 
to brave the viper's nest of the court were allowed to sit. 

The royal family dined at their table atop the dais in the front of the hall 
with Perrington, Roland, and a woman who looked like she might be 
Roland's mother. From the other side of the room, Celaena could hardly see 
little Prince Hollin, but he seemed to be pale, rotund, and blessed with a 
head full of ebony curls. It seemed rather unfair to put Hollin next to Dorian 
--where comparisons could easily be made--and though she'd heard every 
nasty rumor about Hollin, she couldn't help but feel a shred of pity for the 
boy. 

Chaol, to her surprise, opted to sit beside her, five of his men joining them 
at the table. Though there were several guards posted around the room, she 
had no doubt that the ones at her table were just as alert and watchful as 
those stationed by the doors and dais. Her tablemates were all polite to her 
--wary, but polite. They didn't mention what had happened last night, but 
they did quietly ask how she was feeling. Ress, who had guarded her during 
the competition, seemed genuinely relieved that she was better, and was the 
chattiest of them all, gossiping as much as any old court hen. 

"And then," Ress was saying, his boyish face set with fiendish delight, 
"just as he got into her bed, stark naked as the day he was born, her father 
walked in'--winces and groans came from the guards, even Chaol himself 
--"and he dragged him out of bed by his feet, took him down the hall, and 
dumped him down the stairs. He was shrieking like a pig the whole time." 

Chaol leaned back in his seat, crossing his arms. "You would be, too, if 
someone were dragging your naked carcass across the ice-cold floor." He 
smirked as Ress tried to deny it. Chaol seemed so comfortable with the men, 
his body relaxed, eyes alight. And they respected him, too--always glancing 
at him for approval, for confirmation, for support. As Celaena's chuckle 


faded, Chaol looked at her, his brows high. "You're one to laugh. You moan 
about the cold floors more than anyone I know." 

She straightened as the guards gave hesitant smiles. "If I recall correctly, 
you complain about them every time I wipe the floor with you when we 
spar." 

"Oho!" Ress cried, and Chaol's brows rose higher. Celaena gave him a 
grin. 

"Dangerous words," Chaol said. "Do we need to go to the training hall to 
see if you can back them up?" 

"Well, as long as your men don't object to seeing you knocked on your 
ass." 

"We certainly do not object to that," Ress crowed. Chaol shot him a look, 
more amused than warning. Ress quickly added, "Captain." 

Chaol opened his mouth to reply, but then a tall, slim woman walked onto 
the small stage erected along one side of the room. 

Celaena craned her neck as Rena Goldsmith floated across the wooden 
platform to where a massive harp and a man with a violin waited. She'd seen 
Rena perform only once before--years ago, at the Royal Theater, on a cold 
winter night like this. For two hours, the theater was so still that it seemed as 
if everyone had stopped breathing. Rena's voice had floated through 
Celaena's head for days afterward. 

From their table, Celaena could hardly see Rena--just enough to tell that 
she wore a long green dress (no petticoats, no corset, no ornamentation save 
for the woven leather belt circling her narrow hips), and that her red-gold 
hair was unbound. Silence rippled through the hall, and Rena curtsied to the 
dais. When she took her seat before the green-and-gold harp, the spectators 
were waiting. But how long would the court's interest hold? 

Rena nodded to the reedy violinist, and her long, white fingers began 
plucking out a melody on the harp. After a few notes the rhythm established 
itself, followed by the slow, sad sweep of the violin. They wove together, 
blending, lifting up, up, up, until Rena opened her mouth. 

And when she sang, the whole world faded. 

Her voice was soft, ethereal, the sound of a lullaby half-remembered. The 
songs she sang, one by one, held Celaena in place. Songs of distant lands, of 
forgotten legends, of lovers forever waiting to be reunited. 


Not a single soul stirred in the hall. Even the servants remained along the 
walls and in doorways and alcoves. Rena paused between songs only long 
enough to allow a heartbeat of applause before the harp and the violin began 
anew, and she hypnotized them all once more. 

And then Rena looked toward the dais. "This song," she said softly, "is in 
honor of the esteemed royal family who invited me here tonight." 

This song was an ancient legend--an old poem, actually. One Celaena 
hadn't heard since childhood, and never set to music. 

She heard it now as if for the first time: the story of a Fae woman blessed 
with a horrible, profound power that was sought by kings and lords in every 
kingdom. While they used her to win wars and conquer nations, they all 
feared her--and kept their distance. 

It was a bold song to sing; dedicating it to the king's family was even 
bolder. But the royals made no outcry. Even the king just stared blankly at 
Rena as though she weren't singing about the very power he'd outlawed ten 
years ago. Perhaps her voice could conquer even a tyrant's heart. Perhaps 
there was an unstoppable magic inherent in music and art. 

Rena went on, spinning the ageless story of the years that the Fae woman 
served those kings and lords, and the loneliness that consumed her bit by bit. 
And then, one day, a knight came, seeking her power on behalf of his king. As 
they traveled to his kingdom, his fear turned to love--and he saw her not for 
the power she wielded, but for the woman beneath. Of all the kings and 
emperors who had come courting her with promises of wealth beyond 
imagining, it was the knight's gift, of seeing her for who she was--not what 
she was--that won her heart. 

Celaena didn't know when she began crying. Somehow she skipped a 
breath, and it set her lips wobbling. She shouldn't cry, not here, not with 
these people around her. But then a warm, calloused hand grasped hers 
beneath the table, and she turned her head to find Chaol looking at her. He 
smiled slightly--and she knew he understood. 

So Celaena looked at her Captain of the Guard and smiled back. 


Hollin was squirming beside him, hissing and grousing about how bored he 
was and what a stupid performance this was, but Dorian's attention was on 
the long table in the back of the hall. 


Rena Goldsmith's unearthly music wove through the cavernous space, 
wrapping them in a spell that he would have called magic had he not known 
better. But Celaena and Chaol just sat there, staring at each other. 

And not just staring, but something more than that. Dorian stopped hearing 
the music. 

She had never looked at him like that. Not once. Not even for a heartbeat. 

Rena was finishing her song, and Dorian tore his eyes away from them. 
He didn't think anything had happened between them, not yet. Chaol was 
stubborn and loyal enough to never make his move--or to even realize that 
he looked at Celaena the same way she looked at him. 

Hollin's complaining grew louder, and Dorian took a long, long breath. 

He would move on. Because he would not be like the ancient kings in the 
song and keep her for himself. She deserved a loyal, brave knight who saw 
her for what she was and did not fear her. And he deserved someone who 
would look at him like that, even if the love wouldn't be the same, even if the 
girl wouldn't be her. 

So Dorian closed his eyes, and took another long breath. And when he 
opened his eyes, he let her go. 


Hours later, the King of Adarlan stood at the back of the dungeon chamber as 
his secret guards dragged Rena Goldsmith forward. The butcher's block at 
the center of the room was already soaked with blood. Her companion's 
headless corpse lay a few feet away, his blood trickling toward the drain in 
the floor. 

Perrington and Roland stood silent beside the king, watching, waiting. 

The guards shoved the singer to her knees before the stained stone. One of 
them grabbed a fistful of her red-gold hair and yanked, forcing her to look at 
the king as he stepped forward. 

"Tt is punishable by death to speak of or to encourage magic. It is an 
affront to the gods, and an affront to me that you sang such a song in my hall." 

Rena Goldsmith just stared at him, her eyes bright. She hadn't struggled 
when his men grabbed her after the performance or even screamed when 
they'd beheaded her companion. As if she'd been expecting this. 

"Any last words?" 


A queer, calm rage settled over her lined face, and she lifted her chin. "I 
have worked for ten years to become famous enough to gain an invitation to 
this castle. Ten years, so I could come here to sing the songs of magic that 
you tried to wipe out. So I could sing those songs, and you would know that 
we are still here--that you may outlaw magic, that you may slaughter 
thousands, but we who keep the old ways still remember." 

Behind him, Roland snorted. 

"Enough," the king said, and snapped his fingers. 

The guards shoved her head down on the block. 

"My daughter was sixteen," she went on. Tears ran over the bridge of her 
nose and onto the block, but her voice remained strong and loud. "Sixteen, 
when you burned her. Her name was Kaleen, and she had eyes like 
thunderclouds. I still hear her voice in my dreams." 

The king jerked his chin to the executioner, who stepped forward. 

"My sister was thirty-six. Her name was Liessa, and she had two boys 
who were her joy." 

The executioner raised his ax. 

"My neighbor and his wife were seventy. Their names were Jon and 
Estrel. They were killed because they dared try to protect my daughter when 
your men came for her." 

Rena Goldsmith was still reciting her list of the dead when the ax fell. 


Chapter 16 


Celaena dipped her spoon into her porridge, tasted it, then dumped in a 
mountain of sugar. "I much prefer eating breakfast together than going out in 
the freezing cold." Fleetfoot, her head on Celaena's lap, huffed loudly. "I 
think she does, too," she added with a grin. 

Nehemia laughed softly before taking a bite of her bread. "It seems like 
this is the only time of day either of us get to see you," she said in Eyllwe. 

"T've been busy." 

"Busy hunting down the conspirators on the king's list?" A pointed glance 
in her direction; another bite of toast. 

"What do you want me to say?" Celaena stirred the sugar into her 
porridge, focusing on that instead of the look on her friend's face. 

"I want you to look me in the eye and tell me that you think your freedom 
is worth this price." 

"Is this why you've been so on edge lately?" 

Nehemia set down her toast. "How can I tell my parents about you? What 
excuses can I make that will convince them that my friendship with the King s 
Champion"'--she used the common-tongue language for the two words, 
spitting them out like poison--"is in any way an honorable thing? How can I 
convince them that your soul isn't rotted?" 

"I didn't realize that I needed parental approval." 

"You are in a position of power--and knowledge--and yet you just obey. 
You obey and you do not question, and you work only toward one goal: your 
freedom." 

Celaena shook her head and looked away." 

"You turn from me because you know it's true. 

"And what is so wrong with wanting my freedom? Haven't I suffered 
enough to deserve it? So what if the means are unpleasant?" 

"I won't deny that you have suffered, Elentiya, but there are thousands 
more who have also suffered--and suffered more. And they do not sell 
themselves to the king to get what they, too, deserve. With each person you 
kill, I am finding fewer and fewer excuses for remaining your friend." 


Celaena flung her spoon down on the table and stalked to the fireplace. 
She wanted to rip down the tapestries and the paintings and smash all the 
silly little baubles and ornaments she'd bought to decorate her room. Mostly 
she just wanted to make Nehemia stop looking at her like that--like she was 
just as bad as the monster who sat on that glass throne. She took a breath, 
then another, listening for signs of anyone else in her chambers, then turned. 

"I haven't killed anyone," she said softly. 

Nehemia went still. "What?" 

"I haven't killed anyone." She remained where she was standing, needing 
the distance between them to get the words out right. "I faked all of their 
deaths and helped them flee." 

Nehemia ran her hands over her face, smearing the powdered gold she'd 
dusted on her eyelids. After a moment, she lowered her fingers. Her dark, 
lovely eyes were wide. "You haven't killed a single person he's ordered you 
to kill?" 

"Not a single one." 

"What about Archer Finn?" 

"I offered Archer a bargain: I give him until the end of the month to get his 
affairs in order before he fakes his death and flees, and he gives me 
information about the actual enemies of the king." She could tell Nehemia the 
rest of it later--the king's plans, the library catacombs--but mentioning those 
things now would only bring up too many questions. 

Nehemia took a sip of her tea, the liquid inside the cup sloshing as her 
hands shook. "He'll kill you if he finds out." 

Celaena looked to the balcony doors, where a beautiful day was dawning 
in the wide-open world beyond. "I know." 

"And this information that Archer is giving you--what will you do with 
it? What sort of information is it?" 

Celaena briefly explained what he'd told her about the people involved in 
putting Terrasen's lost heir back on the throne, even telling her what had 
happened with Davis. Nehemia's face paled. When Celaena finished, 
Nehemia took another trembling sip of tea. "And you trust Archer?" 

"I think he values his life more than he values anything else." 

"He's a courtesan; how can you be sure you can trust him?" 

Celaena slipped back into her chair, Fleetfoot curling between her feet. 
"Well, you trust me, and I'm an assassin." 


"Tt's not the same." 

Celaena looked to the tapestry along the wall to her left, and the chest of 
drawers in front of it. "While I'm telling you all the things that could get me 
executed, there's something else that I should bring up." 

Nehemia followed her line of sight to the tapestry. After a moment, she let 
out a gasp. "Is that--that's Elena in the tapestry, isn't 1t?" 

Celaena smiled crookedly and crossed her arms. "That's not even the 
worst of it." 


As they walked down to the tomb, Celaena told Nehemia about everything 
that had occurred between her and Elena since Samhuinn--and all the 
adventures that had befallen her. She showed her the room where Cain had 
summoned the ridderak, and as they approached the tomb, Celaena winced as 
she remembered one miserable new detail. 

"Brought a friend?" 

Nehemia yelped. Celaena greeted the bronze, skull-shaped door knocker. 
"Hello, Mort." 

Nehemia squinted at the skull. "How is this--" She looked over her 
shoulder at Celaena. "How is this possible?" 

"Ancient spells and nonsense," Celaena said, cutting off Mort as he began 
recite the story of how King Brannon created him. "Someone used a spell 
with the Wyrdmarks." 

"Someone!" Mort sputtered. "That someone is--" 

"Shut it," Celaena said, and flung open the tomb door, letting Nehemia 
inside. "Save it for someone who cares." 

Mort huffed what sounded like a violent stream of curses, and Nehemia's 
eyes twinkled as they entered the tomb. "It's incredible," the princess 
whispered, gazing at the walls where the Wyrdmarks had been written. 

"What does it say?" 

"Death, Eternity, Rulers," Nehemia recited. "Standard tomb posturing." 
She continued moving through the room. As Nehemia strode about, Celaena 
leaned against a wall and slumped to the ground. Sighing, she rubbed her 
heel against one of the raised stars on the floor, examining the curve that they 
made across the room. 

Do they make a constellation? 


Celaena rose to her feet and stared down. Nine of the stars made up a 
familiar pattern--the Dragonfly. Her brows rose. She'd never realized it 
before. A few feet away another constellation lay on the floor--the Wyvern. 
It sat at the head of Gavin's sarcophagus. 

A symbol of Adarlan's house, as well as the second constellation in the 
sky. 

Celaena followed the line that the shapes made, weaving through the 
tomb. The night sky passed beneath her feet, and by the time she reached the 
final constellation, she would have collided with the wall had Nehemia not 
grabbed her by the arm. 

"What is it?" 

Celaena was staring down at the last constellation--the Stag, Lord of the 
North. The symbol of Terrasen, Elena's home country. The constellation 
faced the wall, and its head seemed to be pointed upward, as though it were 
looking at something ... 

Celaena followed the stag's stare, up through the dozens of Wyrdmarks 
that covered the wall, until-- 

"By the Wyrd. Look at this," she said, pointing. 

An eye, no larger than her palm, was etched into the wall. A hole was 
bored in its center, a perfectly crafted puncture that had been carefully 
concealed within the eye. The Wyrdmark itself made a face, and while the 
other eye was filled in and smooth, this one held a hollowed-out iris. 

It is only with the eye that one can see rightly. There was no way she 
was that lucky--it was surely no more than coincidence. Calming her 
growing excitement, she lifted onto her toes to see into the eye. 

How had she not noticed this before? She took a step back, and the 
Wyrdmark faded into the wall. She stepped back onto the constellation, and it 
appeared again. 

"You can only see the face when you stand on the stag," Nehemia 
whispered. 

Celaena ran her hands over the face, feeling for any cracks or slight 
breezes that might suggest a door into another room. Nothing. With a deep 
breath, she rose onto her toes and faced the eye, her dagger held aloft in case 
anything leapt out at her. Nehemia chuckled softly. And Celaena conceded a 
smile as she put her eye against the stone and peered into the gloom. 


There was nothing. Just a distant wall, illuminated by a small shaft of 
moonlight. 

"Its just--just a blank wall. Does that make any sort of sense?" She'd 
been jumping to conclusions--trying to see things and make connections that 
weren't there. Celaena stepped away so Nehemia could see for herself. 
"Mort!" she hollered while the princess looked. "What the hell is that wall? 
Does it make any sense to you why it would be here?" 

"No," Mort said dully. 

"Don't lie to me." 

"Lie to you? To you? Oh, I couldn't lie to you. You asked me whether it 
makes sense, and I said no. You must learn to ask the right questions before 
you can receive the right answers." 

Celaena growled. "What sort of question might I ask to receive the right 
answer?" 

Mort clicked his tongue. "Ill have none of that. Come back when you 
have some proper questions." 

"You promise yov' ll tell me then?" 

"T'ma door knocker; it's not in my nature to make promises." 

Nehemia stepped away from the wall and rolled her eyes. "Don't listen to 
his teasing. I can't see anything, either. Perhaps it is just a prank. Old castles 
are full of nonsense intended only to confuse and bother later generations. 
But--all these Wyrdmarks ..." 

Celaena took a too-short breath, and then made the request that she'd been 
contemplating for some time now. "Could you--could you teach me how to 
read them?" 

"Oho!" cackled Mort from the hall. "Are you sure you're not too dim to 
understand?" 

Celaena ignored him. She hadn't told Nehemia about Elena's latest 
demand to uncover the king's source of power, because she knew what 
Nehemia's response would be: listen to the dead queen. But the Wyrdmarks 
seemed so connected to everything, somehow--even to that eye riddle and 
this stupid trick wall. And perhaps if she learned how to use them, then she 
could unlock the iron door in the library and find some answers beyond it. 
"Maybe ... maybe just the basics?" 

Nehemia smiled. "The basics are the hardest part." 


Usefulness aside, it was a forgotten secret language, a system for 
accessing a strange power. Who wouldn't want to learn about it? "Morning 
lessons instead of our walk, then?" 

Nehemia beamed, and Celaena felt a twinge of guilt for not telling her 
about the catacombs as the princess said, "Of course." 

When they left, Nehemia spent a few minutes studying Mort--mostly 
asking him questions about his creation spell, which he claimed to have 
forgotten, then claimed was too private, then claimed she had no business 
hearing. 

After Nehemia's near-infinite patience wore thin, they cursed Mort 
soundly and stormed back upstairs, where Fleetfoot was anxiously waiting in 
the bedroom. The dog refused to set foot in the secret passage--probably 
because of some foul stench left over from Cain and his creature. Even 
Nehemia hadn't been able to coax her downstairs with them. 

Once the door was closed and hidden, Celaena leaned against her desk. 
The eye in the tomb hadn't been the solution to the riddle. Now she 
wondered if Nehemia might have a better sense of what it was about. 

"I found a book on Wyrdmarks in Davis's office," she told Nehemia. "I 
can't tell if it's a riddle or a proverb, but someone wrote this on the inside 
back cover: It is only with the eye that one can see rightly." 

Nehemia frowned. "Sounds like an idle lord's nonsense to me." 

"But do you think it's just coincidence that he was a part of this movement 
against the king and had a book on Wyrdmarks? What if this is some sort of 
riddle about them?" 

Nehemia snorted. "What if Davis wasn't even in this group? Perhaps 
Archer had his information wrong. I bet that book had been there for years-- 
and I bet Davis didn't even know it existed. Or maybe he saw it in a 
bookshop and bought it to look daring." 

But maybe he didn't--and maybe Archer was on to something. She would 
question him when she saw him next. Celaena fiddled with the chain of her 
amulet--then went rod-straight. The Eye. "Do you think it could be this 
Eye?" 

"No," Nehemia said. "It wouldn't be that easy." 

"But--" Celaena pushed off the desk. 

"Trust me," Nehemia said. "It's a coincidence--just like that eye in the 
wall. 'The eye' could refer to anything--anything at all. Having eyes 


plastered all over things used to be quite popular centuries ago as a ward 
against evil. Youll drive yourself mad, Elentiya. I can do some research on 
the subject, but it might take a while before I find anything." 

Celaena's face warmed. Fine; maybe she was wrong. She didn't want to 
believe Nehemia, didn't want to think that the riddle could be that 
impossible to solve, but ... the princess knew far more about ancient lore 
than she did. So Celaena sat down at her breakfast table again. Her porridge 
had gone cold, but she ate it anyway. "Thank you," she said in between 
mouthfuls as Nehemia sat down again, too. "For not exploding on me." 

Nehemia laughed. "Elentiya, I'm honestly surprised you told me." 

An opening and closing door, then footsteps, then Philippa knocked and 
bustled in, carrying a letter for Celaena. "Good morning, beautiful ladies," 
she clucked, making Nehemia grin. "A letter for our most esteemed 
Champion." 

Celaena beamed at Philippa and took it, and her smile grew as she read 
the contents once the servant left. "It's from Archer," she told Nehemia. 
"He's given me some names of people who might be involved in this 
movement--people associated with Davis." She was a little shocked he'd 
risk putting it all in a letter. Perhaps she needed to teach him a thing or two 
about code-writing. 

Nehemia had stopped smiling, though. "What sort of man just hands out 
this information like it's nothing more than morning gossip?" 

"A man who wants his freedom and has had enough of serving pigs." 
Celaena folded the letter and stood. If the men on this list were anything like 
Davis, then perhaps handing them over to the king and using them as leverage 
wouldn't be so horrible after all. "I should get dressed; I need to go into the 
city." She was halfway to her dressing room when she turned. "We'll have 
our first lesson over breakfast tomorrow?" 

Nehemia nodded, digging into her food again. 


It took her all day to hunt down the men--to learn where they lived, whom 
they spoke to, how well-guarded they were. None of it yielded anything 
useful. 

She was tired and cranky and hungry when she trudged back to the castle 
at sundown, and her mood only took a turn for the worse when she arrived at 


her rooms and found a note from Chaol. The king had commanded her to be 
on guard duty yet again for the royal ball that night. 


Chapter 17 


Chaol knew Celaena was ina foul mood without even having to speak to her. 
Actually, he hadn't dared speak to her since before the ball had started, other 
than to position her outside on the patio, hidden in the shadows of a pillar. A 
few hours in the winter night would cool her down. 

From his spot inside, tucked into an alcove near a servants' entrance, he 
could keep an eye on the glittering ball in front of him, as well as the assassin 
standing watch just outside the towering balcony doors. Not that he didn't 
trust her--but having Celaena in one of these moods always set him on edge, 
too. 

She was currently leaning against the pillar, arms crossed--not hiding in 
the shadows as he'd told her to. He could see the tendrils of her breath 
curling in the mght air, and the moonlight glinting off the hilt of one of the 
daggers she wore at her side. 

The ballroom had been decorated in hues of white and glacier blue, with 
swaths of silk floating from the ceiling and ornate glass baubles hanging 
between. It was something out of a winter dream, and it was in honor of 
Hollin, of all people. A few hours of entertainment and a small fortune spent 
for a boy who was currently sulking on his little glass throne, shoveling 
sweets down his throat as his mother smiled at him. 

He'd never tell Dorian, but Chaol dreaded the day when Hollin would 
grow into a man. A spoiled child was easy enough to deal with, but a 
spoiled, cruel leader would be another matter entirely. He hoped that 
between him and Dorian, they could check whatever corruption was already 
rotting away in Hollin's heart--once Dorian ascended to the throne. 

The heir was on the dance floor, fulfilling his obligation to court and 
crown by dancing with whatever ladies demanded his attention. Which, not 
surprisingly, was almost all of them. Dorian played his role well and smiled 
throughout the waltzes, a graceful and competent partner, never once 
complaining or turning any lady away. The dance finished, Dorian bowed to 
his partner, and before he could take one step, another courtier was curtsying 
in front of him. If Chaol had been in Dorian's shoes, he would have winced, 
but the prince just grinned, took the lady's hand, and swept her around the 
floor. 


Chaol glanced outside again and straightened. Celaena wasn't by the 
pillar. 

He stifled a snarl. Tomorrow, they were going to have a nice, long chat 
about the rules and the consequences of abandoning posts while on guard 
duty. 

A rule that he was also breaking, he realized as he slipped from the 
alcove and out the door that had been left ajar to allow fresh air into the 
toasty ballroom. 

Where in hell had she gone? Perhaps she'd actually seen some sign of 
trouble--not that there'd ever been an attack on the palace, and not that 
anyone would ever be foolish enough to try during a royal ball. 

But he still put a hand on the hilt of his sword as he approached the 
columns at the top of the stairs leading down into the frosted garden. She'd 
been standing right here, and-- 

Chaol spotted her. 

Well, she'd certainly abandoned her post. But not to face some potential 
threat. 

Chaol crossed his arms. Celaena had left her post to dance. 

The music was loud enough that it reached them out here, and at the foot of 
the steps, Celaena waltzed with herself. She even held the edge of her dark 
cloak in one hand as if it were the skirts of a ball gown, her other hand 
poised on the arm of an invisible partner. He didn't know if he should laugh, 
yell, or just go back inside and pretend he'd never seen it. 

She turned, an elegant sweeping motion that brought her to face him, and 
halted. 

Well, the last option was no longer a possibility. Laughter or yelling, then. 
Though neither felt appropriate now. 

Even in the moonlight, he could see her scowl. "I'm bored to tears and 
nearly dead with cold," she said, dropping her cloak. 

He remained atop the stairs, watching her. 

"And it's your fault," she went on, stuffing her hands into her pockets. 
"You made me come out here, and someone left the balcony door open so I 
could hear all that lovely music." The waltz was still playing, filling the 
frozen air around them with sound. "So you should really reconsider who's 
to blame. It was like putting a starving man in front of a feast and telling him 


not to eat. Which, by the way, you actually did when you made me go to that 
state dinner." 

She was babbling, and her face was dark enough for him to know she was 
beyond mortified that he'd caught her. He bit his lip to keep from smiling and 
walked down the four steps to the gravel path of the garden. "You're the 
greatest assassin in Erilea, and yet you can't stand watch for a few hours?" 

"What's there to watch?" she hissed. "Couples sneaking out to fondle each 
other between the hedges? Or His Royal Highness, dancing with every 
eligible maiden?" 

"You're jealous?" 

She barked a laugh. "No! Gods, no. But I can't say it's particularly fun to 
watch him. Or watch any of them enjoying themselves. I think I'm more 
jealous of that giant buffet no one is even touching." 

He chuckled and glanced up the stairs, to the patio and the ballroom doors 
beyond. He should be back inside already. But here he was, toeing that line 
he couldn't stay away from. 

He'd managed to stay on this side of it last night, even though seeing her 
cry during Rena Goldsmith's song had stirred him so bone deep it was like 
he'd found a part of him he hadn't even realized was missing. He'd made 
them run an extra mile this morning, not to punish her for it, but because he 
couldn't stop thinking about the way she'd looked at him. 

She sighed loudly and studied the moon. It was so bright it drowned out 
the stars. "I heard the music and I just wanted to dance for a few minutes. To 
just ... forget everything for one waltz and pretend to be a normal girl. So"-- 
she glared at him now--"go ahead and snarl and snap at me about it. What 
will my punishment be? Three extra miles tomorrow? An hour of drills? The 
rack?" 

There was a sort of bleak bitterness in her words that didn't sit well with 
him. And yes, they would have a conversation about abandoning posts, but 
right now--tight now ... 

Chaol stepped up to the line. 

"Dance with me," he said, and held out his hand to her. 


Celaena stared at Chaol's outstretched hand. "What?" 
The moonlight caught in his golden eyes, setting them shining. 


"What didn't you understand?" 

Nothing. Everything. Because when he'd said it, it hadn't been the way 
Dorian had asked her to dance at the Yulemas ball. That had merely been an 
invitation. But this ... His hand remained reaching toward her. 

"As far as I recall," she said, lifting her chin, "at Yulemas, 7 asked you to 
dance, and you flat-out refused me. You said it was too dangerous for us to 
be seen dancing together." 

"Things are different now." Again, another layered statement she couldn't 
begin to sort through now. 

Her throat tightened, and she looked at his extended hand, flecked with 
callouses and scars. 

"Dance with me, Celaena," he said again, his voice rough. 

When her eyes found his, she forgot about the cold, and the moon, and the 
glass palace looming above them. The secret library and the king's plans and 
Mort and Elena faded into nothing. She took his hand, and there was only the 
music and Chaol. 

His fingers were warm, even through his gloves. He slid his other hand 
around her waist as she braced one of hers on his arm. She looked up at him 
when he began to move--a slow step, then another, and another, easing into 
the steady rhythm of the waltz. 

He stared back at her, neither of them smiling--somehow beyond smiling 
at that moment. The waltz built, louder, faster, and Chaol steered her into it, 
never stumbling. 

Her breathing turned uneven, but she couldn't look away from him, 
couldn't stop dancing. The moonlight and the garden and the golden glow 
from the ballroom blurred together, now miles away. "We'll never be a 
normal boy and girl, will we?" she managed to say. 

"No," he breathed, eyes blazing. "We won't." 

And then the music exploded around them, and Chaol took her with it, 
spinning her so that her cloak fanned out around her. Each step was flawless, 
lethal, like that first time they'd sparred together so many months ago. She 
knew his every move and he knew hers, as though they'd been dancing this 
waltz together all their lives. Faster, never faltering, never breaking her stare. 

The rest of the world quieted into nothing. In that moment, after ten long 
years, Celaena looked at Chaol and realized she was home. 


Dorian Havilliard stood at the ballroom window, watching Celaena and 
Chaol dance in the garden beyond, their dark cloaks flowing around them like 
they were no more than two wraiths spinning through the wind. After hours of 
dancing, he'd finally managed to get free of the ladies demanding his 
attention, and had come to the window to get some much-needed fresh air. 

He'd intended to go outside, but then he'd seen them. That had been 
enough to still his steps--but not enough to make him walk away. He knew he 
should. He should walk away and pretend he hadn't seen it, because even 
though it was just a dance ... 

Someone stepped beside him, and he glanced over in time to see Nehemia 
stop at the window. After months of being scarce around the court due to the 
rebel massacre in Eyllwe, she'd made an appearance tonight. She was 
resplendent in a cobalt gown with gold-thread accents, her hair coiled and 
braided in a coronet atop her head. Her delicate golden earrings glittered in 
the light of the chandelier, drawing his eye to her elegant neck. Nehemia was 
easily the most stunning woman in the ballroom, and he hadn't failed to 
notice how many men--and women--had been watching her all night. 

"Don't cause trouble for them," she said quietly, her accent still thick, but 
much improved since she'd arrived in Rifthold. Dorian raised an eyebrow. 
Nehemia traced an invisible pattern on the glass pane. "You and I... We will 
always stand apart. We will always have ..." She searched for the word. 
"Responsibilities. We will always have burdens that no one else can ever 
understand. That they'--she inclined her head toward Chaol and Celaena 
--'will never understand. And if they did, then they would not want them." 

They would not want us, is what you mean. 

Chaol spun Celaena, and she flowed smoothly through the air before 
snapping back into his arms. 

"T've already decided to move on," Dorian said with equal quiet. It was 
the truth. He'd awoken this morning feeling lighter than he had in weeks. 

Nehemia nodded, the gold and jewels in her hair twinkling. "Then I thank 
you for that." She traced another symbol on the window. "Your cousin, 
Roland, told me that your father has approved Councilman Mullison's plans 
to swell Calaculla's ranks--to expand the labor camp to accommodate more 
... people." 

He kept his face blank. There were far too many eyes on them. "Roland 
told you that?" 


Nehemia lowered her hand from the window. "He wants me to tell my 
father that I support his agenda--to get my father to make the expansion as 
easy as possible. I refused. He says there's a council meeting tomorrow 
where they will vote on Mullison's plans. I'm not allowed to attend." 

Dorian focused on his breathing. "Roland had no right to do that. Any of 
it." 

"Would you stop it, then?" Her dark eyes were fixed on his face. "Speak 
to your father at the council meeting; convince the others to say no." 

No one except for Celaena dared speak to him like that. But her boldness 
had nothing to do with his response as Dorian said, "I can't." 

His face warmed as the words came out, but it was true. He couldn't 
tackle Calaculla, not without causing a lot of trouble for both himself and 
Nehemia. He'd already convinced his father to leave Nehemia alone. 
Demanding he shut down Calaculla could force him to choose sides--and 
make a choice that could destroy everything he had. 

"You can't, or you will not?" Dorian sighed, but she cut him off. "If 
Celaena were shipped to Calaculla, would you free her? Would you put a 
stop to the camp? When you took her from Endovier, did you think twice 
about the thousands you left behind?" He had, but ... but not for as long as he 
should have. "Innocents work and die in Calaculla and Endovier. By the 
thousands. Ask Celaena about the graves they dig there, Prince. Look at the 
scars on her back, and realize that what she went through is a blessing 
compared to what most endure." Perhaps he'd just gotten used to her accent, 
but he could have sworn she was speaking more clearly. Nehemia pointed at 
the garden, at Celaena and Chaol, who had stopped dancing and were talking 
now. "If she was sent back, would you free her?" 

"Of course I would," he said carefully. "But it's complicated." 

"There is nothing complicated. It is the difference between right and 
wrong. The slaves in those camps have people who love them just as much 
as you loved my friend." 

He glanced around them. Ladies were eagerly watching from behind their 
fans, and even his mother had noticed their lengthy conversation. Outside, 
Celaena had resumed her post by the pillar. At the other end of the room, 
Chaol slipped through one of the patio doors and took up his spot in an 
alcove, his face blank, as if the dance had never happened. "This isn't the 
place for this conversation." 


Nehemia stared at him for a long moment before nodding. "You have 
power in you, Prince. More power than you realize." She touched his chest, 
tracing a symbol there, too, and some of the court ladies gasped. But 
Nehemia's eyes were locked on his. "It sleeps," she whispered, tapping his 
heart. "In here. When the time comes, when it awakens, do not be afraid." 
She removed her hand and gave hima sad smile. "When it is time, I will help 
you." 

With that, she walked away, the courtiers parting, then swallowing up her 
wake. He stared after the princess, wondering what her last words had 
meant. 

And why, when she had said them, something ancient and slumbering deep 
inside of him had opened an eye. 


Chapter 18 


Celaena sat in the parlor of Archer's townhouse, frowning at the crackling 
fireplace. She hadn't touched the tea the butler had laid out for her on the 
low-lying marble table, though she'd certainly indulged in two creampuffs 
and one chocolate torte while waiting for Archer to return. She could have 
come back later, but it was freezing outside, and after standing on guard duty 
last mght, she was exhausted. And in need of anything to distract her from 
reliving that dance with Chaol. 

After the waltz had finished, he'd merely told her that if she abandoned 
her post again, he'd break a hole through the ice in the trout pond and toss her 
in. And then, as though he hadn't just danced with her in a way that made her 
knees tremble, he stalked back inside and left her to suffer in the cold. He 
hadn't even mentioned the dance this morning during their run. Maybe she'd 
just imagined the whole thing. Maybe the frigid night air had made her stupid. 

She'd been distracted during her first Wyrdmarks lesson with Nehemia 
that morning and had earned a fair amount of scolding as a result. She blamed 
the complex, near-nonsensical language. She'd learned a few languages 
before--enough to get by in places where Adarlan's language laws hadn't 
taken root--but Wyrdmarks were completely different. Trying to learn them 
while also trying to unravel the labyrinth that was Chaol Westfall was 
impossible. 

Celaena heard the front door open. Muffled words, hurried footsteps, and 
then--Archer's beautiful face popped in. "Just give me a moment to freshen

up. 

She stood. "That won't be necessary. This won't take long." 

Archer's green eyes glimmered, but he slipped into the parlor, shutting the 
mahogany door behind him. 

"Sit," she told him, not particularly caring that this was his house. Archer 
obeyed, taking a seat in the armchair across from the couch. His face was 
flushed from the cold, making his lovely eyes seem even greener. 

She crossed her legs. "If your butler doesn't stop listening at the keyhole, 
I'm going to cut off his ears and shove them down his throat." 


There was a muffled cough, followed by retreating footsteps. Once she 
was sure no one else was listening, she leaned back into the couch cushions. 
"I need more than a list of names. I need to know what, exactly, they're 
planning--and how much they know about the king." 

Archer's face paled. "I need more time, Celaena." 

"You have little more than three weeks left." 

"Give me five." 

"The king only gave me a month to kill you. I already have a hard time 
convincing everyone you're a difficult target. I can't give you more time." 

"But I need it to wrap up things here in Rifthold and to get you more 
information. With Davis dead, they're all being extra careful. No one is 
talking. No one dares whisper anything." 

"Do they know Davis was a mistake?" 

"Mistakes happen often enough in Rifthold for us to know that most of 
them are anything but mistakes." He ran his hands through his hair. "Please. 
Just a little more time." 

"I don't have any to give you. I need more than names, Archer." 

"What about the Crown Prince? And the Captain of the Guard? Perhaps 
they have the information you need. You're close with both of them, aren't 
you?" 

She bared her teeth at him. "What do you know about them?" 

Archer gave her a steady, calculating look. "You think I didn't recognize 
the Captain of the Guard the day you just happened to run into me outside of 
the Willows?" His attention flicked to her side, where her hand currently 
rested on a dagger. "Have you told them about your plan to keep me alive?" 

"No," she said, her grip on the dagger relaxing. "No, I haven't. I don't 
want to involve them." 

"Or is it because you don't actually trust either of them?" 

She shot to her feet. "Don't presume to know anything about me, Archer." 

She stalked to the door and flung it open. The butler was nowhere to be 
seen. She looked over her shoulder at Archer, whose eyes were wide as he 
watched her. "You have until the end of the week--six days--to get me more 
information. If you don't give me anything by then, my next visit won't be 
nearly as pleasant." 

Not giving him the time to reply, she stormed out of the room, grabbed her 
cloak from the front closet, and strode back out onto the icy city streets. 





The maps and figures in front of Dorian had to be wrong. Someone had to be 
playing a joke, because there was no way Calaculla had this many slaves. 
Seated at the long table in his father's council chamber, Dorian glanced at the 
men around him. None looked surprised, none looked upset. Councilman 
Mullison, who had taken a special interest in Calaculla, was practically 
beaming. 

He should have fought to get Nehemia into this council meeting. But there 
was probably nothing she could say right now that would have any impact on 
a decision that had clearly already been made. 

His father was smiling faintly at Roland, his head propped on a fist. The 
black ring on the king's hand glinted in the dim light from the beastly 
fireplace, that mouth-shaped hearth that seemed poised to devour the room. 

From his spot beside Perrington, Roland gestured to the map. Another 
black ring glinted on Roland's hand--the same as the one Perrington wore, 
too. "As you can see, Calaculla can't support the current number of slaves. 
There are too many to even fit in the mines as it is--and though we have them 
digging for new deposits, the work has been stagnant." Roland smiled. "But, 
slightly to the north, right along the southern edge of Oakwald, our men have 
discovered an iron deposit that seems to cover a large area. It's close enough 
to Calaculla that we could erect a few new buildings to house additional 
guards and overseers, bring in even more slaves if we want, and start work 
on it right away." 

Impressed murmurs, and a nod from his father to Roland made Dorian's 
jaw clench. Three matching rings; three black rings to signify--what? That 
they were bound in some way to each other? How had Roland gotten past his 
father's and Perrington's defenses so quickly? Because of his support of a 
place like Calaculla? 

Nehemia's words from the night before kept ringing in his head. He'd seen 
the scars on Celaena's back up close--a brutal mess of flesh that made him 
sick with rage to look at. How many like her were rotting away in these labor 
camps? 

"And where will the slaves sleep?" Dorian suddenly asked. "Will you 
build shelter for them, too?" 

Everyone, including his father, turned to look at him. But Roland just 
shrugged. "They're slaves. Why shelter them, when they can sleep in the 





mines? Then we wouldn't waste time bringing them in and out every day." 

More murmurs and nods. Dorian stared at Roland. "If we have a surplus 
of slaves, then why not let some of them go? Surely they're not all rebels and 
criminals." 

A growl from down the table--his father. "Watch your tongue, Prince." 

Not a father to his son, but a king to his heir. Still, that icy rage was 
growing, and he kept seeing Celaena's scars, her too-thin body the day they'd 
pulled her out of Endovier, her gaunt face and the hope and desperation 
mingling in her eyes. He heard Nehemia's words: What she went through is 
a blessing compared to what most endure. 

Dorian peered down the table at his father, whose face was dark with 
irritation. "Is this the plan? Now that we've conquered the continent, you'll 
throw everyone into Calaculla or Endovier, until there's no one left in the 
kingdoms but people from Adarlan?" 

Silence. 

The rage dragged him down to the place where he'd felt that flicker of 
ancient power when Nehemia had touched his heart. "You keep tightening the 
leash, and it's going to snap," Dorian said to his father, then looked across 
the table to Roland and Mullison. "How about you spend a year in Calaculla, 
and when you're done, you two can sit here and tell me about your plans for 
expansion." 

His father slammed his hands on the table, rattling the glasses and 
pitchers. "You will mind your mouth, Prince, or you will be thrown out of 
this room before the vote." 

Dorian shot out of his seat. Nehemia had been right. He hadn't looked at 
the others in Endovier. He hadn't let himself: "T ve heard enough," he snarled 
at his father, at Roland and Mullison, at Perrington, and at all the lords and 
men in the room. "You want my vote? Then here it is: No. Not in a thousand 
years." 

His father growled, but Dorian was already walking across the red 
marble floor, past that horrible fireplace, out the doors, and into the bright 
halls of the glass castle. 

He didn't know where he was going, only that he felt freezing cold--a 
cold that fueled the calm, glittering rage. He took flight after flight of stairs 
down into the stone castle, then long hallways and narrow staircases until he 


found a forgotten hall where there were no eyes to see him as he drew back 
his fist and punched the wall. 

The stone cracked under his hand. 

Not a small crack, but a spiderweb that kept growing and growing toward 
the window on the right, until-- 

The window exploded, glass showering everywhere as Dorian dropped 
into a crouch and covered his head. Air rushed in, so cold his eyes blurred, 
but he just knelt there, fingers in his hair, breathing, breathing, breathing as 
the anger ebbed out of him. 

It wasn't possible. Maybe he'd just hit the wall in the wrong spot, and the 
damn thing was so ancient that it had only been waiting for something like 
this to happen. He'd never heard of stone cracking that way--spreading out 
like a living thing--and then the window ... 

Heart racing, Dorian lowered his hands from his head and looked at them. 
There wasn't a bruise or a cut, or even a trace of pain. But he'd hit that wall 
as hard as he could. He could have--should have--broken his hand. Yet his 
knuckles were unharmed--only white from gripping his fingers in a tight fist. 

On trembling legs, Dorian rose and surveyed the damage. 

The wall had splintered, but remained intact. The ancient window, 
however, had shattered completely. And around him, around where he had 
crouched ... 

A perfect circle, clean of debris, as if the glass and wood had showered 
everything but him. 

It wasn't possible. Because magic-- 

Magic ... 

Dorian dropped to his knees and was violently sick. 


Curled on the couch beside Chaol, Celaena took a sip of her tea and frowned. 
"Can't you hire a servant like Philippa, so we can have someone bring us 
treats?" 

Chaol raised an eyebrow. "Don't you ever stay in your own rooms 
anymore?" 

No. Not if she could help it. Not with Elena and Mort and all that 
nonsense just a secret door away. Ordinarily, she might have sought sanctuary 
in the library, but not now. Not when the library held so many secrets it made 


her head spin to think about them. For a moment, she wondered if Nehemia 
had discovered anything about the riddle in Davis's office. She'd have to ask 
her tomorrow. 

She kicked Chaol in the ribs with a sock-covered foot. "All I'm saying is 
that I'd like some chocolate cake every now and then." 

He closed his eyes. "And an apple tart, and a loaf of bread, and a pot of 
stew, and a mountain of cookies, and a--" He chuckled as she put her foot 
against his face and pushed. He grabbed her foot and wouldn't let go when 
she tried yanking her leg back. "It's true, and you know it, Laena." 

"So what if it is? Haven't I earned the right to eat as much as I want, 
whenever I want?" She wrenched her foot out of his grasp as the smile faded 
from his face. 

"Yes," he said quietly, his voice barely audible over the crackling fire. 
"You have." After a few moments of silence, he stood up and walked to the 
door. 

She sat up on her elbows. "Where are you going?" 

He opened the door. "To get you chocolate cake." 

When he returned, and after they'd both eaten half of the cake he'd swiped 
from the kitchens, Celaena lay back on the couch, a hand on her full belly. 
Chaol was already sprawled across the cushions, sleeping soundly. Staying 
up until the middle of the night at the ball, then awakening for their sunrise 
run this morning had been exhausting. Why hadn't he just canceled the run? 

You know, the courts weren t always like this, Nehemia had said. There 
was a time when people valued honor and loyalty--when serving a ruler 
wasn't about obedience and fear.... Do you think another court like that 
could ever rise again? 

Celaena hadn't given Nehemia an answer. She hadn't wanted to talk about 
it. But looking at Chaol now, at the man he was, and the man he was still 
becoming ... 

Yes, she thought. Yes, Nehemia. It could rise again, if we could find more 
men like him. 

But not in a world with this king, she realized. He'd crush a court like that 
before Nehemia could muster one. If the king were gone, then the court that 
Nehemia dreamed of could change the world. That court could undo the 
damage of a decade of brutality and terror; it could restore the lands ravaged 


by conquest and renew the hearts of the kingdoms that shattered when 
Adarlan marched in. 

And in that world ... Celaena swallowed hard. She and Chaol would 
never be a normal boy and girl, but perhaps in that world they could make a 
life of their own. She wanted that life. Because even though he'd pretended 
nothing had happened after the dance they'd shared last night, something had. 
And maybe it had taken her this long to realize it, but this man--she wanted 
that life with him. 

The world Nehemia dreamed about, and the world Celaena sometimes 
dared let herself consider, was nothing more than a shred of hope and a 
memory of what the kingdoms had once been. But perhaps the rebel 
movement truly knew about the king's plans and how to ruin them--how to 
destroy him, with or without Aelin Galathynius and whatever army they 
claimed she was raising. 

Celaena sighed and eased off the couch, gently shifting Chaol's legs so she 
didn't disturb him. She turned back, though--just once, leaning down to 
brush her fingers through his short hair, then graze them along his cheek. Then 
she quietly slipped from his room, taking the remnants of the chocolate cake 
with her. 


She was wondering whether eating the rest of the chocolate cake would make 
her severely sick when she turned down her hallway and spotted Dorian 
sitting on the floor outside her rooms. He looked over when he saw her, his 
eyes going to the cake in her hands. Celaena blushed and lifted her chin. They 
hadn't spoken since their argument over Roland. Perhaps he'd come to 
apologize. Served him right. 

But as she neared and Dorian got to his feet, she took one look at the 
expression in his sapphire eyes and knew he wasn't here for an apology. 

"Tt's a bit late for a visit," she said by way of greeting. 

Dorian put his hands in his pockets and leaned against the wall. His face 
was pale, his eyes haunted, but he gave her half a smile. "It's a bit late for 
chocolate cake, too. Been raiding the kitchens?" 

She remained outside her rooms, running an eye over him. He looked fine 
--no bruises, no signs of injury--yet something was off. "What are you doing 
here?" 


He avoided her gaze. "I was looking for Nehemia, but her servants said 
she was out. I thought they meant here; then I thought you two might be out for 
a Stroll." 

"I haven't seen her since this morning. Is there something you want from 
her?" 

Dorian took a ragged breath, and Celaena suddenly realized just how cold 
it was in the hallway. How long had he been sitting here on the freezing 
floor? "No," he said, shaking his head as if convincing himself of something. 
"No, there isn't." 

He began walking away. She started speaking before she knew she'd 
opened her mouth. "Dorian. What's wrong?" 

He turned. For a heartbeat, there was something in his eyes that reminded 
her of a world long since burned--a glimmer of color and power that still 
stalked the edges of her nightmares. But he blinked, and it was gone. 
"Nothing. There's nothing wrong at all." He strode away, hands still in his 
pockets. "Enjoy your cake," he said over his shoulder, and then was gone. 


Chapter 19 


Chaol stood before the king's throne, almost boring himself to tears as he 
gave yesterday's report. He tried not to think about last night--how the brief 
touch of Celaena's fingers through his hair and on his face had sent a pang of 
desire through him so strong he'd wanted to grab her and pin her on the 
couch. It had taken all his self-control to keep his breathing steady, to keep 
pretending that he was asleep. After she'd left, his heart had been pounding 
so hard it took him an hour to calm enough to actually sleep. 

Looking at the king now, Chaol was glad he'd controlled himself. The line 
between him and Celaena was there for a reason. Crossing it could call into 
question his loyalty to the king before him--not to mention the way it would 
impact his friendship with Dorian. The prince had made himself scarce this 
past week; Chaol would have to make a point today to go see him. 

Dorian and the king were where his loyalty lay. Without his loyalty, he 
was no one. Without it, he'd given up his family, his title, for nothing. 

Chaol finished explaining his security plans for the carnival that would 
arrive today, and the king nodded. "Very well, Captain. Make sure your men 
watch the castle grounds, too. I know what sort of filth likes to travel with 
these carnivals, and I don't want them wandering around." 

Chaol bowed his head. "Consider it done." 

Normally, the king would dismiss him with a grunt and a wave, but today, 
the man merely studied him, an elbow propped on the arm of his glass throne. 
After a moment of silence--during which Chaol wondered if a castle spy had 
somehow been looking through the keyhole when Celaena touched him--the 
king spoke. 

"Princess Nehemia needs to be watched." 

Of all the things the king could have said, this was not what Chaol had 
expected. But he kept his face blank and did not question the words that 
implied so much. 

"Her ... influence is starting to be felt in these halls. And I am beginning 
to wonder if perhaps the time has come to remove her back to Eyllwe. I 
know that we already have some men watching her, but I also received word 
that there was an anonymous threat on her life." 


Questions roared through him, along with a rising sense of dread. Who 
had threatened her? What had Nehemia said or done to warrant the threat? 

Chaol stiffened. "I haven't heard anything about that." 

The king smiled. "No one has. Not even the princess herself. It seems 
she's made some enemies outside the palace as well." 

"Tl have extra guards watch her rooms and patrol her wing of the castle. 
PI alert her immediately of--" 

"There is no need to alert her. Or anyone." The king gave him a pointed 
look. "She might try to use the fact that someone wants her dead as a 
bargaining chip--might try to make herself into a martyr of sorts. So tell your 
men to stay quiet." 

He didn't think Nehemia would do that, but Chaol kept his mouth shut. 
He'd tell his men to be discreet. 

And he wouldn't tell the princess--or Celaena. Just because he was 
friendly with Nehemia, just because she was Celaena's friend, it didn't 
change anything. While he knew that Celaena would be furious that he didn't 
tell her, he was the Captain of the Guard. He had fought and sacrificed nearly 
as much as Celaena had to get to this position. He'd let her get too close by 
asking her to dance--he'd let himself get too close. 

"Captain?" 

Chaol blinked, then bowed low. "You have my word, Your Majesty." 





Dorian panted, swinging the sword through the air in a precise parry that sent 
the guard scrambling. His third match, and his third opponent about to go 
down. He hadn't slept last night, nor had he been able to sit still this morning. 
So he'd come to the barracks, hoping to have someone wear him down 
enough for exhaustion to take over. 

He parried and deflected the guard's assault. It had to be a mistake. 
Maybe he'd dreamed it all up. Maybe it had just been a combination of the 
right elements at the wrong time. Magic was gone, and there was no reason 
that he should have that power, when not even his father had been gifted with 
magic. Magic had been dormant in the Havilliard bloodline for generations. 

Dorian got past the guard's defense in an easy maneuver, though when the 
young man raised his hands in defeat, the prince had to wonder if he'd let him 


win. The thought sent a growl rippling through him. He was about to demand 
another match when someone sauntered over to them. "Mind if I join?" 

Dorian stared at Roland, whose rapier looked like it had hardly ever been 
used. The guard took one look at Dorian's face, bowed, and found someplace 
else to be. Dorian watched his cousin, the black ring on Roland's finger. "I 
don't think you want to dance with me today, cousin." 

"Ah," Roland said, frowning. "About yesterday ... I'm sorry for that. Had 
I known the labor camps were such a sensitive matter for you, I never would 
have broached the subject or worked with Councilor Mullison. I called off 
the vote after you left. Mullison was furious." 

Dorian raised his brows. "Oh?" 

Roland shrugged. "You were right. I don't know anything about what it's 
like in those camps. I only took up the cause because Perrington suggested 
that I work with Mullison, who stood to gain a lot from the expansion 
because of his ties to the iron industry." 

"And I'm supposed to believe you?" 

Roland gave him a winning smile. "We are family, after all." 

Family. Dorian had never really considered himself to be in an actual 
family. And certainly not now. If anyone found out about what had happened 
in that hallway yesterday, about the magic he might have, his father would 
kill him. He had a second son, after all. Families weren't exactly supposed to 
think like that, were they? 

Dorian had gone looking for Nehemia last night out of desperation, but in 
the light of morning, he was grateful he hadn't seen her. If the princess had 
that sort of information about him, she could use it to her advantage-- 
blackmail him all she wanted. 

And Roland ... Dorian began walking away. "Why don't you save your 
maneuvering for someone who cares?" 

Roland kept pace beside him. "Ah, but who else is more worthy than my 
own cousin? What greater challenge than winning you over to my schemes?" 
Dorian shot him a warning glare and found the young man grinning. "If only 
you'd seen the chaos that erupted after you left," Roland went on. "As long as 
I live, Pll never forget the look on your father's face when you growled at 
them all." Roland laughed, and, despite himself, Dorian found a smile tugging 
on his lips. "I thought the old bastard would combust right there." 


Dorian shook his head. "He's hanged men for calling him such names, you 
know." 

"Yes, but when you're as handsome as I am, dear cousin, you'd be 
surprised by how much more you can get away with." 

Dorian rolled his eyes, but considered his cousin for a few moments. 
Roland might be close with Perrington and his father, but ... perhaps he'd 
just been pulled into Perrington's schemes and needed someone to steer him 
right. And if his father and the other councilmen thought that they could use 
Roland to win support for their dark dealings, well, then it was time for 
Dorian to play the game, too. He could turn his father's pawn against him. 
Between the two of them, surely they could sway enough of the council to 
oppose more unsavory proposals. 

"You really called off the vote?" 

Roland waved a hand. "I think you're right that we're pushing our luck 
with the other kingdoms. If we want to keep control, we need to find a 
balance. Shoving them into slavery won't help; it might just turn more people 
toward rebellion." 

Dorian nodded slowly, and paused. "I have somewhere to be," he lied, 
sheathing his sword, "but perhaps l' 11 see you in the hall for dinner." 

Roland gave him an easy smile. "T Il try to muster up a few lovely ladies 
to keep us company." 

Dorian waited until Roland was around the corner before heading outside, 
where the chaos of the courtyard sucked him up. The carnival his mother had 
commissioned for Hollin--her belated Yulemas present to him--had finally 
arrived. 

It was not a massive carnival; only a few black tents, a dozen cage 
wagons, and five covered wagons had been set up in the open courtyard. The 
whole thing felt rather somber, despite the fiddler sawing away and the merry 
shouts of the workers scrambling to finish setting up the tents in time to 
surprise Hollin that evening. 

People hardly looked Dorian's way as he meandered through the throng. 
Then again, he was dressed in sweaty, old clothes and had his cloak wrapped 
tightly around him. Only the guards--highly trained and aware of everything 
--noticed him, but they understood his need for anonymity without being 
told. 


A stunningly beautiful woman walked out of one of the tents--blond, 
slender, tall, and dressed in fine riding clothes. A mountain-sized man also 
emerged, carrying long poles of iron that Dorian doubted most men could 
even lift. 

Dorian passed by one of the large covered wagons, pausing at the words 
written in white paint on its side: 


THE CARNIVAL OF MIRRORS! 


SEE ILLUSIONS AND REALITY COLLIDE! 


He frowned. Had his mother even put a moment's consideration into the 
gift, into how it might appear, the message it would send? Carnivals, with 
their illusions and tricks, always pushed the limit of outright treason. Dorian 
snorted. Perhaps he belonged in one of these cages. 

A hand landed on his shoulder, and Dorian whirled to find Chaol smiling 
at him. "I thought l'd find you here." He wasn't surprised in the least that 
Chaol had recognized him. 

Dorian was about to smile back when he noticed who was with the 
captain. Celaena was standing at one of the covered cages, listening through 
the black velvet curtains to whatever was inside. "What are you two doing 
here so early? The unveiling's not until nightfall." Nearby, the gargantuan 
man began hammering foot-long spikes into the frozen earth. 

"She wanted a walk, and--" Chaol suddenly gave a violent curse. Dorian 
didn't particularly want to, but he followed after Chaol as he stalked to 
Celaena and yanked her arm away from the black curtain. "You'll lose your 
hand like that," the captain warned her, and she glared at him. 

Then she gave Dorian a close-lipped smile that felt more like a wince. He 
hadn't lied to her last night about wanting to see Nehemia. But he'd also 
found himself wanting to see her--until she appeared with that ridiculous 
half-eaten cake, which she clearly had plans to devour in private. 

He couldn't begin to imagine how she'd look at him if she found out he 
might--might, he kept telling himself--have some trace of magic within him. 

Nearby, the beautiful blond woman perched on a stool and began playing 
the lute. He knew that the men--and guards--starting to flock to her weren't 
just there for the lovely music. 


Chaol shifted on his feet, and Dorian realized that they'd been standing 
there silently, not saying anything. Celaena crossed her arms. "Did you find 
Nehemia last night?" 

He had a feeling she already knew the answer, but he said, "No. I went 
back to my room after I saw you." 

Chaol looked at Celaena, who merely shrugged. What did that mean? 

"So," Celaena said, surveying the carnival, "do we really have to wait for 
your brother before we can see what's inside all these cages? Looks like the 
performers are already starting." 

And they were. All sorts of jugglers and sword-swallowers and fire- 
breathers milled about, while tumblers balanced on impossible things: chair 
backs, poles, a bed of nails. 

"I think this is just practice," Dorian said, and he hoped he was right, 
because if Hollin learned that anyone had started without his approval ... 
Dorian would make sure he was far away from the castle when that tantrum 
occurred. 

"Hmm," Celaena said, and walked deeper into the teeming carnival. 

Chaol was watching the prince warily. There were questions in Chaol's 
eyes--questions that Dorian had no intention of answering--so he strode 
after Celaena, because leaving the carnival would feel too much like drawing 
a line. They made their way to the last and largest wagon in the rough 
semicircle of tents and cages. 

"Welcome! Welcome!" shouted an old woman, bent and gnarled with age, 
from a podium at the foot of its stairs. A crown of stars adorned her silver 
hair, and though her tanned face was saggy and speckled, there was a spark in 
her brown eyes. 

"Look into my mirrors and see the future! Let me examine your palm so I 
might tell you myself!" The old woman pointed with a knotted cane at 
Celaena. "Care to have your fortune told, girl?" Dorian blinked--then 
blinked again at the sight of the woman's teeth. They were razor-sharp, like a 
fish's, and made of metal. Of--of iron. 

Celaena pulled her green cloak tightly around her, but remained staring at 
the crone. 

Dorian had heard the legends of the fallen Witch Kingdom, where 
bloodthirsty witches had overthrown the peaceful Crochan Dynasty and then 
ripped apart the kingdom stone by stone. Five hundred years later, songs 


were still sung of the deadly wars that had left the Iron-teeth Clans the only 
ones standing on a killing field, dead Crochan queens all around them. But 
the last Crochan queen had cast a spell to ensure that as long as Ironteeth 
banners flew, no bit of soil would yield life to them. 

"Come into my wagon, dear heart," the old woman crooned at Celaena, 
"and let old Baba Yellowlegs take a look into your future." Sure enough, 
peeking out from beneath her brown robe were saffron-colored ankles. 

Celaena's face had drained of color, and Chaol went to her side and took 
her elbow. Despite the way the protective gesture made Dorian's gut twist, 
he was glad Chaol had done it. But this was all just a sham--that woman had 
probably put on a fake set of iron teeth and sheer yellow stockings, and 
called herself Baba Yellowlegs to make carnival patrons hand over good 
coin. 

"Youre a witch," Celaena said, her voice strangled. She didn't think it 
was a sham, apparently. No, her face was still white as death. Gods--was 
she actually scared? 

Baba Yellowlegs laughed, a crow's cackle, and bowed. "The lastborn 
witch in the Witch Kingdom." To Dorian's shock, Celaena took a step back, 
closer to Chaol now, a hand going to the necklace she always wore. "Care to 
have your fortune read now?" 

"No," Celaena said, almost leaning into Chaol. 

"Then get out of my way and let me go about my business! I've never seen 
such a cheap crowd!" Baba Yellowlegs snarled, and lifted her head to look 
over them. "Fortunes! Fortunes!" 

Chaol took a step toward her, a hand on his sword. "Don't be so rude to 
your customers." 

The crone smiled, her teeth glinting in the afternoon light as she sniffed at 
him. "And what would a man who smells of the Silver Lake do to an innocent 
old witch like me?" 

A chill went down Dorian's spine, and it was Celaena's turn to grab on to 
Chaol's arm as she tried to pull him away. But Chaol refused to move. "I 
don't know what sort of sham you're running, old woman, but you'd best 
mind your tongue before you lose it." 

Baba Yellowlegs licked her razor-sharp teeth. "Come and get it," she 
purred. 


Challenge flashed in Chaol's eyes, but Celaena was still so pale that 
Dorian took her by the arm, leading her away. "Let's go," he said, and the old 
woman shifted her eyes to him. If she could indeed tell things about them, 
then the /ast place he wanted to be was here. "Chaol, let's go." 

The witch was grinning at him as she used a long, metallic nail to pick out 
something from her teeth. "Hide from fate all you like," Baba Yellowlegs 
said as they turned away. "But it shall soon find you!" 


"You're shaking." 

"No, I'm not," Celaena hissed, batting Chaol's hand from her arm. It was 
bad enough that Dorian was there, but for Chaol to witness her coming face- 
to-face with Baba Yellowlegs ... 

She knew the stories--legends that had given her brutal nightmares as a 
child, a firsthand account that a former friend had once told her. Given how 
that friend had foully betrayed and nearly killed her, Celaena had hoped that 
the horrific stories about the Ironteeth witches were just more lies. But 
seeing that woman ... 

Celaena swallowed hard. Seeing that woman, feeling the sense of 
otherness that radiated from her, Celaena had no trouble believing that these 
witches were capable of consuming a human child until nothing but clean- 
picked bones remained. 

Frozen down to her core now, she followed Dorian as he strode away 
from the carnival. While she'd been standing in front of that wagon, all she'd 
wanted, for some reason, was to get inside it. Like there was something 
waiting for her within. And that crown of stars the witch had been wearing 
... And then her amulet had started feeling heavy and warm, the way it had 
the night she'd seen that person in the hall. 

If she ever came back to the carnival, she would bring Nehemia with her, 
just to see if Yellowlegs was indeed what she claimed to be. She didn't give 
a damn about what was in the cages. Not anymore, not with Yellowlegs to 
hold her interest. She followed Dorian and Chaol without hearing a single 
word they said until they had somehow arrived at the royal stables, and 
Dorian was leading them inside. 

"I was going to give it to you on your birthday," he said to Chaol, "but 
why wait another two days?" 


Dorian stopped before a stall. Chaol exclaimed, "Are you out of your 
mind?" 

Dorian grinned--an expression she hadn't seen in so long that it made her 
remember late nights spent tangled up with him, the warmth of his breath on 
her skin. "What? You deserve it." 

A night-black Asterion stallion stood within the pen, staring at them with 
ancient, dark eyes. 

Chaol was backing away, hands raised. "This is a gift for a prince, not--" 

Dorian clicked his tongue. "Nonsense. P11 be offended if you don't 
accept." 

"T can't." Chaol shifted pleading eyes to Celaena, but she shrugged. 

"T had an Asterion mare once," she admitted, and both of them blinked. 
Celaena went up to the stall and held out her fingers, letting the stallion sniff 
her. "Her name was Kasida." She smiled at the memory, stroking the 
stallion's velvet-soft nose. "It meant 'Drinker of the Wind' in the dialect of 
the Red Desert. She looked like a storm-tossed sea." 

"How did you get an Asterion mare? They're worth even more than the 
stallions," Dorian said. It was the first normal-sounding question he'd asked 
her in weeks. 

She looked over her shoulder at them and flashed a fiendish grin. "I stole 
her from the Lord of Xandria." Chaol's eyes grew wide, and Dorian cocked 
his head. It was so comical that she started laughing. "I swear on the Wyrd 
it's the truth. P11 tell you the story some other time." She backed away, 
nudging Chaol toward the pen. The horse huffed at his fingers, and beast and 
man looked at each other. 

Dorian was still watching her with narrowed brows, but when she caught 
him staring, he turned to Chaol. "Is it too early to ask what you'll be doing 
for your birthday?" 

Celaena crossed her arms. "We have plans," she said before Chaol could 
reply. She didn't mean to sound so sharp, but--well, she'd been planning the 
night for a few weeks now. 

Chaol looked at her over a shoulder. "We do?" 

Celaena gave him a venomously sweet smile. "Oh, yes. It might not be an 
Asterion stallion, but ..." 

Dorian's eyes flashed. "Well, I hope you have fun," he interrupted. 


Chaol quickly looked back at the horse as Celaena and Dorian faced each 
other. Whatever familiar expressions he'd once worn were now gone. And 
part of her--the part that had spent so many nights looking forward to seeing 
that handsome face--truly mourned it. Looking at him became difficult. 

She left them in the stables with a brief good night, congratulating Chaol 
on his new gift. She didn't dare turn in the direction of the carnival, where 
the sound of the crowd suggested that Hollin had made his appearance and 
unveiled the cages. Instead, she sprinted up the stairs to the warmth of her 
rooms, trying to shut out the image of the witch's iron teeth, and the way 
she'd called after them with those words about fate, so similar to what Mort 
had said on the night of the eclipse ... 

Perhaps it was intuition, or perhaps it was because she was a miserable 
person who couldn't even trust the advice of a friend, but she wanted to go 
back to the tomb. Alone. Maybe Nehemia was wrong about the amulet being 
irrelevant. And she was tired of waiting for her friend to find the time to 
research the eye riddle. 

She'd go back just once, and never tell Nehemia. Because the hole in the 
wall was shaped like an eye, its iris removed to form a space that would 
perfectly fit the amulet she wore around her neck. 


Chapter 20 


"Mort," Celaena said, and the skull knocker opened an eye. 

"Its terribly rude to wake someone when they're sleeping," he said 
drowsily. 

"Would you have preferred it if I had knocked on your face?" He glared at 
her. "I need to know something." She held out the amulet. "This necklace-- 
does it truly have power?" 

"Of course it does." 

"But it's thousands of years old." 

"So?" Mort yawned. "It's magic. Magical things rarely age as normal 
objects do." 

"But what does it do?" 

"It protects you, as Elena said. It guards you from harm, though you 
certainly seem to do your best to get into trouble." 

Celaena opened the door. "I think I know what it does." Perhaps it was 
mere coincidence, but the riddle had been worded so specifically. Perhaps 
Davis had been looking for the same thing Elena wanted her to find: the 
source of the king's power. This could be the first step toward uncovering 
that. 

"You're probably wrong," Mort said as she walked by. "I'm just warning 
you." 

She didn't listen. She went right up to the hollow eye in the wall and 
stood on tiptoe to look through. The wall on the other side was still blank. 
Unfastening her necklace, Celaena carefully lifted the amulet to the eye, and 


It fit. Sort of. Her breath caught in her throat, and Celaena leaned up 
against the hole, peering through the delicate gold bands. 

Nothing. No change on the wall, or on the giant Wyrdmark. She turned the 
necklace upside down, but it was the same. She tried it on either side, 
backward, angled--but nothing. Just the same blank stone wall, illuminated 
by a shaft of moonlight from some vent above. She pushed against the stone, 
feeling for any door, any moveable panel. 


"But it's the Eye of Elena! 'It is only with the eye that one can see rightly'! 
What other eye is there?" 

"You could rip out your own and see if it fits,' Mort sang from the 
doorway. 

"Why won't it work? Do I need to say a spell?" She glanced at the 
sarcophagus of the queen. Perhaps the spell would be triggered by ancient 
words--words hiding right under her nose. Wasn't that always how these 
things happened? She refitted the amulet into the stone. "Ah!" she called into 
the night air, reciting the words engraved at Elena's feet. "Time's Rift!" 

Nothing happened. 

Mort cackled. She snatched the amulet out of the wall. "Oh, I hate this! I 
hate this stupid tomb, and I hate these stupid riddles and mysteries!" Fine-- 
fine. Nehemia was right that the amulet was a dead end. And she was a 
wretched, horrible friend for being so distrustful and impatient. 

"I told you it wouldn't work." 

"Then what will work? That riddle does reference something in this tomb 
--behind that wall. Doesn't it?" 

"Yes, it does. But you still haven't asked the proper question." 

"Pve asked you dozens of questions! And you won't give me any 
answers!" 

"Come back another--" he started, but Celaena had already stalked up the 
stairs. 


Celaena stood on the barren edge of a ravine, a chill northern wind ruffling 
her hair. She'd had this dream before; always this setting, always this night of 
the year. 

Behind her sloped a rocky, wasted plain, and before her stretched a chasm 
so long it disappeared into the starlit horizon. Across the ravine was a lush, 
dark wood, rustling with life. 

And on the grassy lip of the other side stood the white stag, watching her 
with ancient eyes. His massive antlers glowed in the moonlight, wreathing 
him in ivory glory, just as she remembered. It had been on a chill night like 
this that she'd spotted him through the bars of her prison wagon on the way to 
Endovier, a glimmer of a world before it was burned to ash. 

They watched each other in silence. 


She took a half step closer to the edge, but paused as loose pebbles 
trickled free, tumbling into the ravine. There was no end to the darkness in 
that ravine. No end, and no beginning, either. It seemed to breathe, pulsing 
with whispers of faded memories, forgotten faces. Sometimes, it felt as 
though the darkness stared back at her--and the face it wore was her own. 

Beneath the dark, she could have sworn she heard the rushing of a half- 
frozen river, swollen with melting snow off the Staghorns. A flash of white, 
the thud of hooves on soft earth, and Celaena looked up from the ravine. The 
stag had come closer, his head now angled, as if inviting her to join him. 

But the ravine only seemed to grow wider, like the maw of a giant beast 
opening to devour the world. 

So Celaena did not cross, and the stag turned away, his steps near silent as 
he disappeared between the tangled trees of the ageless wood. 


Celaena awoke to darkness. The fire was nothing but cinders, and the moon 
had set. 

She studied the ceiling, the faint shadows cast by the city lights in the 
distance. It was always the same dream, always this one night. 

As if she could ever forget the day when everything she had loved had 
been wrenched from her, and she'd awoken covered in blood that was not 
her own. 

She got out of bed, Fleetfoot leaping down beside her. She walked a few 
steps, then paused in the center of the room, staring into the dark, into the 
endless ravine still beckoning to her. Fleetfoot nuzzled her bare legs, and 
Celaena reached down to stroke the hound's head. 

They remained there for a moment, gazing into that blackness without end. 

Celaena left the castle long before dawn broke. 


When Celaena didn't meet Chaol at the barracks door that dawn, he gave her 
ten minutes before stalking up to her rooms. Just because she didn't feel like 
going out in the cold wasn't an excuse to be lax with her training. Not to 
mention he was particularly interested in hearing the story about how she'd 
stolen an Asterion mare from the Lord of Xandria. He smiled at the thought, 


shaking his head. Only Celaena would have the nerve to do something like 
that. 

His smile faded when he reached her chambers and found Nehemia sitting 
at the small table in the foyer, a cup of steaming tea before her. There were 
some books piled in front of the princess, and she looked up from one of 
them as he entered. Chaol bowed. The princess just said, "She is not here." 

Celaena's bedroom door was open wide enough to reveal that the bed 
was empty and already made. "Where is she?" 

Nehemia's eyes softened, and she picked up a note that was lying among 
the books. "She has taken today off," she said, reading from the note before 
setting it down. "If I were to guess, I'd say that she is as far away from the 
city as she can get in half a day's ride." 

"Why?" 

Nehemia smiled sadly. "Because today is the tenth anniversary of her 
parents' death." 


Chapter 21 


Chaol's breath caught. He remembered her screaming at the duel with Cain, 
when Cain had taunted her about the brutal murder of her parents--when 
she'd awoken covered in their blood. She'd never told him anything else, and 
he hadn't dared ask. He knew she'd been young, but he hadn't realized she'd 
been only eight. Eight. 

Ten years ago, Terrasen had been in upheaval, and anyone who had defied 
Adarlan's invading forces had been slaughtered. Entire families had been 
dragged out of their homes and murdered. His stomach clenched. What 
horrors had she witnessed that day? 

Chaol ran a hand over his face. "She told you about her parents in her 
note?" Maybe it held a shred more information--anything for him to better 
understand what sort of woman he'd be facing when she returned, what sort 
of memories he'd have to contend with. 

"No," Nehemia said. "She didn't tell me. But I know." She watched him 
with a calculated stillness, a switch to the defensive that he recognized. What 
sort of secrets was she protecting for her friend? And what sort of secrets did 
Nehemia herself keep that had caused the king to have her watched? The fact 
that he didn't know anything about it, about how much the king knew, enraged 
him to no end. And then there was the other question: who had threatened the 
princess's life? He'd ordered more guards to look after her, but so far, there 
had been no sign of anyone wanting to harm her. 

"How do you know about her parents?" he asked. 

"Some things you hear with your ears. Others, you hear with your heart." 
He looked away from the intensity in her eyes. 

"When is she coming back?" 

Nehemia returned to the book in front of her. It looked like it was filled 
with strange symbols; vaguely familiar markings that tickled at his memory. 
"She said she won't be back until after nightfall. If I were to guess, I'd say 
she didn't want to spend one moment of daylight in this city--especially in 
this castle." 

In the home of the man whose soldiers had probably butchered her family. 


Chaol took the morning training run alone. He ran through the mist- 
shrouded game park until his very bones were exhausted. 


In the misty foothills above Rifthold, Celaena strode between the trees of the 
small forest, barely more than a sliver of darkness winding through the 
woods. She had been walking since before dawn, letting Fleetfoot follow as 
she would. Today, even the forest seemed silent. 

Good. Today was not a day for the sounds of life. Today was for the 
hollow wind rustling branches, for the rushing of a half-frozen river, for the 
crunch of snow under her boots. 

On this day last year, she'd known what she had to do--had seen every 
step with such brutal clarity that it had been easy when the time came. She'd 
once told Dorian and Chaol that she'd snapped that day in the Salt Mines of 
Endovier, but it was a lie. Snapped implied too human a feeling; nothing like 
the cold, hopeless rage that had taken hold and shut everything down when 
she'd awoken from the dream of the stag and the ravine. 

She found a large boulder nestled between the bumps and hollows and 
sank down on its smooth, ice-cold top, Fleetfoot soon sitting beside her. 
Wrapping her arms around the dog, Celaena looked out into the still forest 
and remembered the day she'd unleashed herself upon Endovier. 


Celaena panted through her bared teeth as she yanked the pickax out of the 
overseer s stomach. The man gurgled blood, clutching at his gut as he 
looked to the slaves in supplication. But one glance from Celaena, one 
flash of eyes that showed she had gone beyond the edge, kept the slaves at 
bay. 

She merely smiled down at the overseer as she swung the ax into his 
face. His blood sprayed her legs. 

The slaves still stayed far away when she brought down the ax upon the 
shackles that bound her ankles to the rest of them. She didn t offer to free 
them, and they didn t ask; they knew how useless it would be. 

The woman at the end of the chain gang was unconscious. Her back 
poured blood, split open by the iron-tipped whip of the dead overseer. She 


would die by tomorrow if her wounds were not treated. Even if they were, 
she'd probably die from infection. Endovier amused itself like that. 

Celaena turned from the woman. She had work to do, and four overseers 
had to pay a debt before she was done. 

She stalked from the mine shaft, pickax dangling from her hand. The two 
guards at the end of the tunnel were dead before they realized what was 
happening. Blood soaked her clothes and her bare arms, and Celaena 
wiped it from her face as she stormed down to the chamber where she knew 
the four overseers worked. 

She had marked their faces the day they'd dragged that young Eyllwe 
woman behind the building, marked every detail about them as they used 
her, then slit her throat from ear to ear. 

Celaena could have taken the swords from the fallen guards, but for 
these four men, it had to be the ax. She wanted them to know what 
Endovier felt like. 

She reached the entrance to their section of the mines. The first two 
overseers died when she heaved the ax into their necks, slashing back and 
forth between them. Their slaves screamed, backing against the walls as 
she raged past them. 

When she reached the other two overseers, she let them see her, let them 
try to draw their blades. She knew it wasn t the weapon in her hands that 
made them stupid with panic, but rather her eves--eyes that told them they 
had been tricked these past few months, that cutting her hair and whipping 
her hadnt been enough, that she had been baiting them into forgetting that 
Adarlan''s Assassin was in their midst. 

But she had not forgotten a second of pain, nor what she had seen them 
do to the others--to that young woman from Eyllwe, who had begged to 
gods who did not save her. 

The men died too quickly, but Celaena had one more task to complete 
before she would meet her end. She prowled back up the main tunnel that 
led out of the mines. Guards foolishly came rushing out of tunnel mouths to 
meet her. 

She surged upward, hacking and swinging. Two more guards went down, 
and she took up their swords, leaving the ax behind. The slaves didnt 
cheer as their oppressors fell; they just watched in silence, understanding. 
This was not a fight for escape. 


The light of the surface made her blink, but she was ready. Her eyes 
having to adjust to the sun would be her greatest weakness. That was why 
she had waited until the softer light of afternoon. Twilight would have 
been better, but that time of day was too heavily guarded, and there were 
too many Slaves about then that could be caught in the crossfire. This last 
hour of full daylight, when the warm sun lulled many to sleep, was when 
the sentries went lax on watch before the evening inspection. 

The three sentries at the entrance to the mines didnt know what was 
happening below. Everyone was always screaming in Endovier. Everyone 
sounded the same when they died. And the three sentries screamed just like 
the others. 

And then she was running, sprinting for the death that beckoned to her, 
making for the towering stone wall at the other end of the compound. 

Arrows whizzed past, and she zigzagged. They wouldnt kill her, by 
order of the king. An arrow through the shoulder or leg, maybe. But she'd 
make them reconsider their orders once the carnage was too massive to 
ignore. 

Other sentries came rushing from everywhere, and her blades were a 
song of steel fury as she cut through them. Silence settled over Endovier. 

She took a gash in her leg--deep, but not deep enough to cut the tendon. 
They still wanted her able to work. But she wouldn't work--not again, not 
for them. When the body count was high enough, they'd have no choice but 
to put that arrow through her throat. 

But then she neared the gate, and the arrows stopped. 

She started laughing when she found herself surrounded by forty 
guards, and laughed even more when they called for irons. 

She was laughing when she lashed out one last time--one final attempt 
to touch the wall. Four more went down in her wake. 

She was still laughing when the world went black and her fingers hit the 
rocky ground--barely an inch away from the wall. 


Chaol stood from his seat at her foyer table as the door quietly opened. The 
outside hall was dark, the lights burned out; most of the castle asleep and 
tucked into their beds. He'd heard the clock chime midnight some time ago, 
but he knew it wasn't exhaustion weighing down Celaena's shoulders when 


she slipped into her rooms. Her eyes were purple beneath, her face wan, lips 
colorless. 

Fleetfoot rushed to him, tail wagging, and licked him a few times on the 
hand before she trotted into the bedroom, leaving them alone. 

Celaena glanced once at him, her turquoise-and-gold eyes weary and 
haunted, and began unfastening her cloak as she walked past him into the 
bedroom. 

Wordlessly, he followed her, if only because she hadn't had a hint of 
warning or reproach in her expression--rather a bleakness that suggested she 
wouldn't have cared if she'd found the King of Adarlan himself in her rooms. 

She removed her coat and then her boots, leaving them wherever she 
happened to discard them. He looked away as she unbuttoned her tunic and 
walked into the dressing room. A moment later, she walked back out, 
wearing a nightgown that was far more modest than her usual lacy attire. 
Fleetfoot had already hopped into bed, sprawling against the pillows. 

Chaol swallowed hard. He should have given her privacy instead of 
waiting here. If she'd wanted him to be here, she would have written him a 
note. 

Celaena stopped before the dim fireplace and used the poker to stir the 
coals before tossing another two logs on. She stared down at the flames. Her 
back was still to him when she spoke. 

"If you're trying to figure out what to say to me, don't bother. There's 
nothing that can be said, or done." 

"Then let me keep you company." If she realized how much he knew, she 
didn't care to ask how. 

"I don't want company." 

"Want and need are different things." Nehemia, probably, should have 
been here--another child of a conquered kingdom. But he didn't want 
Nehemia to be the one she turned to. And despite his loyalty to the king, he 
couldn't turn away from her--not today. 

"So you're just going to stay here all night?" She flicked her eyes to the 
couch between them. 

"Tve slept in worse places." 

"I think my experience with 'worse places' is a lot more horrible than 
yours." Again, that twisting in his gut. But then she looked through the open 


bedroom door to the foyer table, and her brows rose. "Is that ... chocolate 
cake?" 

"I thought you might need some." 

"Need, not want?" 

A ghost of a smile was on her lips, and he almost sagged in relief as he 
said, "For you, I'd say that chocolate cake is most definitely a need." 

She crossed from the fireplace to where he stood, stopping a hand's 
breadth away and staring up at him. Some of the color had returned to her 
face. 

He should step back, put more distance between them. But instead, he 
found himself reaching for her, a hand slipping around her waist and the other 
twining itself through her hair as he held her tightly to him. His heart 
thundered through him so hard he knew she could feel it. After a second, her 
arms came up around him, her fingers digging into his back in a way that 
made him realize how close they stood. 

He shoved that feeling down, even as the silken texture of her hair against 
his fingers made him want to bury his face in it, and the smell of her, laced 
with mist and night, had him grazing his nose against her neck. There were 
other kinds of comfort that he could give her than mere words, and if she 
needed that kind of distraction ... He shoved down that thought, too, 
swallowing it until he nearly choked on it. 

Her fingers were moving down his back, still digging into his muscles 
with a fierce kind of possession. If she kept touching him like that, his control 
was going to slip completely. 

And then she pulled back, just far enough to look up at him again, still so 
close their breath mingled. He found himself gauging the distance between 
their lips, his eyes flicking between her mouth and her eyes, the hand he had 
entwined in her hair stilling. 

Desire roared through him, burning down every defense he'd put up, 
erasing every line he'd convinced himself he had to maintain. 

And then she said, so quietly it was hardly more than a murmur, "I can't 
tell if I should be ashamed of wanting to hold you on this day, or grateful that, 
despite what happened before now, it somehow brought me to you." 

He was so startled by the words that he let go, let go and stepped back. 
He had his obstacles to overcome, but so did she--perhaps more obstacles 
than he'd even realized. 


He had no response to what she'd said. But she didn't give him time to 
think of the right words before she walked to the chocolate cake in the foyer, 
plunked down in the chair, and dug in. 


Chapter 22 


The silence of the library wrapped around Dorian like a heavy blanket, 
interrupted only by the turning of pages as he read through his family's 
extensive genealogical charts, records, and histories. He couldn't be the only 
one; if he truly did have magic, then what about Hollin? It had taken until 
now to manifest, so perhaps it wouldn't reveal itself in Hollin for another 
nine years. Hopefully by then, he'd figure out how to suppress it and teach 
Hollin to do the same. He might not be fond of his brother, but he didn't wish 
the boy dead--especially not the kind of death their father would give them if 
he learned what dwelled in their blood. Beheading, dismemberment, then 
burning. Complete annihilation. 

No wonder the Fae had fled the continent. They had been powerful and 
wise, but Adarlan had military might and a frantic public looking for any 
solution to the famine and poverty that had plagued the kingdom for decades. 
It hadn't just been the armies that had made the Fae run--no, it was also the 
people who had lived in an uneasy truce with them, as well as the mortals 
gifted with magic, for generations. How would those people react if they 
knew that the heir to the throne was plagued by the same powers? 

Dorian ran a finger down his mother's family tree. It was dotted with 
Havilliards along the way; a close mingling of their two families for the past 
few centuries that had given rise to numerous kings. 

But he'd been here for three hours now, and none of the rotting old books 
held any mention of magic-wielders. In fact, there had been a drought in the 
line for centuries. Several gifted people had married into the bloodline, but 
their children hadn't been born with the power, no matter what manner of 
gifts their parents posessed. Was it coincidence, or divine will? 

Dorian closed the book and stalked back into the stacks. He reached the 
section along the back wall that held all the genealogical records and pulled 
out the oldest book he could find--one that held records dating back to the 
founding of Adarlan itself. 

There, on the top of the family tree, was Gavin Havilliard, the mortal 
prince who had taken his war band into the depths of the Ruhnn Mountains to 
challenge the Dark Lord Erawan. The war had been long and brutal, and in 
the end, only a third of the men who had ridden in with Gavin came out of 


those mountains. But Gavin also emerged from that war with his bride--the 
princess Elena, the half-Fae daughter of Brannon, Terrasen's first king. It was 
Brannon himself who gave Gavin the territory of Adarlan as a wedding gift 
--and a reward for the prince and princess's sacrifices during the war. And 
since then, no Fae blood had bred into their line. Dorian followed the tree 
down and down. Just longforgotten families whose lands were now called by 
different names. 

Dorian sighed, set down the book, and browsed through the stack. If Elena 
had gifted the line with her power, then perhaps answers could be found 
elsewhere ... 

He was surprised to see the book sitting there, given how his father had 
destroyed that noble house ten years ago. But there it was: a history of the 
Galathynius line, starting with the Fae King Brannon himself. Dorian flipped 
through the pages, his brows raised high. He'd known the line was blessed 
with magic, but this ... 

It was a powerhouse. A bloodline so mighty that other kingdoms had lived 
in terror of the day the Lords of Terrasen would come to claim their lands. 

But they never had. 

While they'd been gifted, they'd never once pushed their borders--even 
when wars came to their doorstep. When foreign kings had threatened them, 
the retribution had been swift and brutal. But always, no matter what, they 
kept to their borders. Kept the peace. 

As my father should have done. 

Despite all their power, though, the Galathynius family had fallen, and 
their noble lords with them. In the book he held, no one had bothered to mark 
the houses his father had exterminated, or the survivors sent into exile. 
Without the heart or the knowledge to do it himself, Dorian closed the book, 
grimacing as all those names burned in his vision. What sort of throne would 
he inherit someday? 

If the heir of Terrasen, Aelin Galathynius, had lived, would she have 
become a friend, an ally? His bride, perhaps? 

He'd met her once, in the days before her kingdom became a charnel 
house. The memory was hazy, but she'd been a precocious, wild girl--and 
had set her nasty, brutish older cousin on him in order to teach Dorian a 
lesson for spilling tea on her dress. Dorian rubbed his neck. Of course, as 
fate would have it, her cousin wound up becoming Aedion Ashryver, his 


father's prodigy general and the fiercest warrior in the north. He'd met 
Aedion a few times over the years, and at each encounter with the haughty 
young general, he'd gotten the distinct impression that Aedion wanted to kill 
him. 

And with good reason. 

Shuddering, Dorian replaced the book and stared at the bookcase, as if it 
would yield any answers. But he already knew there was nothing here that 
could help him. 

When the time comes, I will help you. 

Did Nehemia know what dwelt inside him? She had acted so strangely 
that day at the duel, drawing symbols in the air and then fainting. And then 
there had been the moment when that mark had burned on Celaena's brow ... 

A clock chimed somewhere in the library, and he glanced down the aisle. 
He should go. It was Chaol's birthday, and he should at least say hello to his 
friend before Celaena whisked him off. Of course he hadn't been invited. 
And Chaol hadn't tried to suggest that Dorian was welcome, either. What did 
she plan to do, exactly? 

The temperature in the library dropped, a frozen draft blowing in from a 
distant corridor. 

Not that he cared. He'd meant it when he swore to Nehemia that he was 
done with Celaena. And maybe he should have told Chaol that he could have 
her. Not that she'd ever belonged to him--or that she'd even tried to suggest 
that he belonged to her. 

He could let go. He had let go. He'd let go. Let go. Let-- 

Books flew from their shelves, dozens upon dozens bursting into flight, 
and this time, they slammed into him as he staggered back toward the end of 
the row. He shielded his face, and when the sound of leather and paper 
stopped, Dorian braced a hand on the stone wall behind him and gaped. 

Half of the books in the row had been tossed off their shelves and 
scattered about, as if thrown by some invisible force. 

He rushed to them, shoving volumes back onto their shelves in no order 
whatsoever, working as fast as he could before one of the crotchety royal 
librarians came hobbling over to see what the noise was about. It took him a 
few minutes to put them all back, his heart pounding so hard he thought he'd 
be sick again. 


His hands trembled--and not just with fear. No, there was some force still 
running through him, begging him to unleash it again, to open himself up ... 

Dorian crammed the last book back onto the shelf and took off at a run. 

He could tell no one. Trust no one. 

When he reached the main hall of the library, he slowed to a walk, 
feigning a lazy carelessness. He even managed to smile at the old, withered 
librarian who bowed to him as he passed. Dorian gave him a friendly wave 
before striding out the towering oak doors. 

He could trust no one. 

That witch at the carnival--she hadn't recognized him as the prince. Still, 
her gift had rung true, at least when talking to Chaol. It was a risk, but 
perhaps Baba Yellowlegs had the answers he needed. 


Celaena wasn't nervous. She had nothing--absolutely nothing--to be 
worried about. It was just a dinner. A dinner she'd spent weeks arranging 
whenever she had a spare moment while spying on those men in Rifthold. A 
dinner at which she'd be alone. With Chaol. And after last night ... 

Celaena took a surprisingly shaky breath and checked herself in the mirror 
one last time. The dress was pale blue, almost white, and encrusted with 
crystal beading that made the fabric look like the shimmering surface of the 
sea. Perhaps it was a bit much, but she'd told Chaol to dress well, so 
hopefully he'd be wearing something nice enough to make her feel less self- 
conscious. 

Celaena huffed. Gods above, she was feeling self-conscious, wasn't she? 
It was ridiculous, really. It was just a dinner. Fleetfoot was with Nehemia for 
the night, and--and if she didn't leave now, she'd be late. 

Refusing to let herself sweat another second longer, Celaena grabbed her 
ermine cloak from where Philippa had left it on the ottoman in the center of 
her dressing room. 

When she reached the entrance hall, Chaol was already waiting for her by 
the doors. Even from across the massive space, she could tell his eyes were 
on her as she descended the stairs. Not surprisingly, he wore black--but at 
least it wasn't his uniform. No, his tunic and pants looked to be of fine make, 
and it seemed like he'd even run a comb through his short hair. 


He watched her every step across the hall, his face unreadable. At last she 
stopped in front of him, the cold air from the open doors biting into her face. 
She hadn't gone for their run this morning, and he hadn't come to drag her 
outside. "Happy birthday," she said before he could object to her clothes. 

His eyes rose to her face, and he gave her a half smile, that unreadable, 
closed-off expression vanishing. "Do I even want to know where you're 
taking me?" 

She grinned at him, her nerves melting away. "Somewhere utterly 
inappropriate for the Captain of the Guard to be seen." She inclined her head 
toward the carriage that waited outside the castle doors. Good. She'd 
threatened to flay the driver and footmen alive if they were late. "Shall we?" 

As they rode through the city, sitting on opposite sides of the carriage, they 
talked about anything but last night--the carnival, Fleetfoot, Hollin's daily 
tantrums. They even debated whether spring would start showing itself at 
last. When they reached the building--an old apothecary-- 

Chaol raised his brows. "Just wait," she said, and led him into the warmly 
lit shop. 

The owners smiled at her, beckoning them up the narrow stone staircase. 
Chaol said nothing as they went up and up the stairs, past the second level, 
and the third, until they reached a door at the uppermost landing. The landing 
was small enough that he brushed against the skirts of her gown, and when 
she turned to him, one hand on the doorknob, she gave him a small smile. "It 
might not be an Asterion stallion, but ..." 

She opened the door, stepping aside so he could enter. 

Wordlessly, he walked in. 

She'd spent hours arranging everything, and in the daylight it had looked 
lovely, but at night ... It was exactly as she'd imagined it would be. 

The roof of the apothecary was an enclosed glass greenhouse, filled with 
flowers and potted plants and fruit trees that had been hung with little 
glittering lights. The whole place had been transformed into a garden out of 
an ancient legend. The air was warm and sweet, and by the windows 
overlooking the expanse of the Avery River stood a small table set for two. 

Chaol surveyed the room, turning in place. "It's the Fae woman's garden 
--from Rena Goldsmith's song," he said softly. His golden eyes were bright. 

She swallowed hard. "I know it's not much--" 





"No one has ever done anything like this for me." He shook his head in 
awe, looking back at the greenhouse. "No one." 

"It's just a dinner," she said, rubbing her neck and walking to the table, if 
only because the urge to go to him was so strong that she needed a table 
between them. 

He followed her, and an instant later, two servants appeared to pull out 
their chairs for them. She smiled a little as Chaol's hand shot to his sword, 
but upon seeing that they were not being ambushed, he gave her a sheepish 
glance and sat down. 

The servants poured two glasses of sparkling wine, then bustled off for 
the food that they'd spent all day preparing in the apothecary's kitchen. She'd 
managed to hire the cook from the Willows for the night--for a fee that had 
made her consider punching the woman's throat. It was worth it, though. She 
lifted her flute of wine. 

"Many happy returns," she said. She'd had a little speech prepared, but 
now that they were here, now that his eyes were so bright, and he was 
looking at her the way he had last night ... all the words went right out of her 
head. 

Chaol lifted his glass and drank. "Before I forget to say it: Thank you. 
This is ..." He examined the glittering greenhouse again, then looked out to 
the river beyond the glass walls. "This is ..." He shook his head once more, 
setting down his glass, and she caught a glimmer of silver in his eyes that 
made her heart clench. He blinked it away and looked back at her with a 
small smile. "No one has thrown me a birthday party since I was a child." 

She scoffed, fighting past the tightness in her chest. "I'd hardly call this a 
party--" 

"Stop trying to downplay it. It's the greatest gift Pve been given in a long 
while." 

She crossed her arms, leaning back in her chair as the servants arrived, 
bringing their first course--roast boar stew. "Dorian got you an Asterion 
stallion." 

Chaol was staring down at his soup, brows high. "But Dorian doesn't 
know what my favorite stew is, does he?" He glanced up at her, and she bit 
her lip. "How long have you been paying attention?" 

She became very interested in her stew. "Don't flatter yourself. I just 
bullied the castle's head cook to tell me what dishes you favored." 


He snorted. "You might be Adarlan's Assassin, but even you couldn't 
bully Meghra. If you'd tried, I think you'd be sitting there with two black 
eyes and a broken nose." 

She smiled, taking a bite of stew. "Well, you might think you're 
mysterious and brooding and stealthy, Captain, but once you know where to 
look, you're a fairly easy book to read. Every time we have roast boar stew, 
I can barely get a spoonful before you've eaten the whole tureen." 

He tipped his head back and laughed, and the sound sent heat coursing 
through every part of her. "And here I was, thinking I'd managed to hide my 
weaknesses so well." 

She gave hima wicked grin. "Just wait until you see the other courses." 


When they'd eaten the last crumb of chocolate-hazelnut cake and drunk the 
last of the sparkling wine, and when the servants had cleared everything 
away and bid their farewells, Celaena found herself standing on the small 
balcony at the far edge of the roof, the summer plants buried under a blanket 
of snow. She held her cloak close to her as she stared toward the distant spot 
where the Avery met the ocean, Chaol beside her, leaning against the iron 
railing. 

"There's a hint of spring in the air," he said as a mild wind whipped past 
them. 

"Thank the gods. Any more snow and P11 go mad." 

In the glow of the lights from the greenhouse, his profile was illuminated. 
She'd meant the dinner to be a nice surprise--a way to tell him how much 
she appreciated him--but his reaction ... How long had it been since he felt 
cherished? Apart from that girl who had treated him so foully, there was also 
the matter of the family that had shunned him just because he wanted to be a 
guard, and they were too proud to have a son serve the crown in that manner. 

Did his parents have any idea that in the entire castle, in the entire 
kingdom, there was no one more noble and loyal than him? That the boy 
they'd thrown out of their lives had become the sort of man that kings and 
queens could only dream of having serve in their courts? The sort of man that 
she hadn't believed existed, not after Sam, not after everything that had 
happened. 


The king had threatened to kill Chaol if she didn't obey his orders. And, 
considering how much danger she was putting him in right now, and how 
much she wanted to gain--not just for herself, but for them... 

"I have to tell you something," she said softly. Her blood roared through 
her ears, especially as he turned to her with a smile. "And before I tell you, 
you have to promise not to go berserk." 

The smile faded. "Why do I have a bad feeling about this?" 

"Just promise." She clenched the railing, the cold metal biting into her 
bare hands. 

He studied her carefully, then said, "I'll try." 

Fair enough. Like a damned coward, she turned away from him, focusing 
on the distant ocean instead. 

"I haven't killed any of the people the king commanded me to 
assassinate." 

Silence. She didn't dare look at him. 

"ve been faking their deaths and smuggling them out of their homes. 
Their personal effects are given to me after I approach them with my offer, 
and the body parts come from sick-houses. The only person that P ve actually 
killed so far is Davis, and he wasn't even an official target. At the end of the 
month, once Archer has gotten his affairs in order, Pll fake his death, and 
Archer will get on the next ship out of Rifthold and sail away." 

Her chest was so tight it hurt, and she slid her eyes to him. 

Chaol's face was bone white. He backed away, shaking his head. "You've 
gone mad." 


Chapter 23 


He must have heard her incorrectly. Because there was no possible way that 
she could be that brash, that foolish and insane and idealistic and brave. 

"Have you lost your senses completely?" His words rose into a shout, a 
riot of rage and fear that rushed through him so fast he could hardly think. 
"He'll kill you! He will kill you if he finds out." 

She took a step toward him, that spectacular dress glinting like a thousand 
stars. "He won t find out." 

"Its only a matter of time," he gritted out. "He has spies who are 
watching everything." 

"And you'd rather I kill innocent men?" 

"Those men are traitors to the crown!" 

"Traitors!" She barked a laugh. "Traitors. For refusing to grovel before a 
conqueror? For sheltering escaped slaves trying to get home? For daring to 
believe in a world that's better than this gods-forsaken place?" She shook her 
head, some of her hair escaping. "I will not be his butcher." 

And he hadn't wanted her to. From the second she'd been crowned 
Champion, he'd been sick at the thought of her doing what the king had 
commanded she do. But this ... "You swore an oath to him." 

"And how many oaths did he swear to foreign rulers before he marched in 
with his armies and destroyed everything? How many oaths did he swear 
when he ascended the throne, only to spit on those promises?" 

"He will kill you, Celaena." He grabbed her by the shoulders and shook 
her. "He'll kill you, and make me do it as punishment for being your friend." 
That was the terror that he grappled with--the fear that plagued him, the thing 
that had kept him on this side of the line for so long. 

"Archer has been giving me real information--" 

"I don't give a damn about Archer. What information could that conceited 
ass have that could possibly help you?" 

"This secret movement from Terrasen actually exists,' she said with 
maddening calm. "I could use the information I've gathered about it to 
bargain with the king to let me go--or just give me a shorter contract. Short 
enough that if he ever finds out the truth, P' 11 be long gone." 


He growled. "He could have you whipped just for being that impertinent." 
But then the last part of her words registered, hitting him like a punch to the 
face. PIU be long gone. Gone. "Where will you go?" 

"Anywhere," she said. "As far away as I can get." 

He could hardly breathe, but he managed to say, "And what would you 
do?" 

She shrugged, and both of them realized that he'd been gripping her 
shoulders. He eased his grip, but his fingers ached to grab her again, as 
though it would somehow keep her from leaving. "Live my life, I suppose. 
Live it the way I want to, for once. Learn how to be a normal girl." 

"How far away?" 

Her blue-and-gold eyes flickered. "I'd travel until I found a place where 
they'd never heard of Adarlan. If such a place exists." 

And she would never come back. 

And because she was young, and so damn clever and amusing and 
wonderful, wherever she made her home, there would be some man who 
would fall in love with her and who would make her his wife, and that was 
the worst truth of all. It had snuck up on him, this pain and terror and rage at 
the thought of anyone else with her. Every look, every word from her ... He 
didn't even know when it had started. 

"We'll find that place, then," he said quietly. 

"What?" Her brows narrowed. 

"Pll go with you." And though he hadn't asked, they both knew those 
words held a question. He tried not to think of what she'd said last night--of 
the shame she'd felt holding him when he was a son of Adarlan and she was 
a daughter of Terrasen. 

"What about being Captain of the Guard?" 

"Perhaps my duties aren't what I expected them to be." The king kept 
things from him; there were so many secrets, and perhaps he was little more 
than a puppet, part of the illusion that he was starting to see through ... 

"You love your country," she said. "I can't let you give all that up." He 
caught the glimmer of pain and hope in her eyes, and before he knew what he 
was doing, he'd closed the distance between them, one hand on her waist and 
the other on her shoulder. 

"I would be the greatest fool in the world to let you go alone." 


And then there were tears rolling down her face, and her mouth became a 
thin, wobbling line. 

He pulled back, but didn't let her go. "Why are you crying?" 

"Because," she whispered, her voice shaking, "you remind me of how the 
world ought to be. What the world can be." 

There had never been any line between them, only his own stupid fear and 
pride. Because from the moment he'd pulled her out of that mine in Endovier 
and she had set those eyes upon him, still fierce despite a year in hell, he'd 
been walking toward this, walking to her. 

So Chaol brushed away her tears, lifted her chin, and kissed her. 


The kiss obliterated her. 

It was like coming home or being born or suddenly finding an entire half 
of herself that had been missing. 

His lips were hot and soft against hers--still tentative, and after a 
moment, he pulled back far enough to look into her eyes. She trembled with 
the need to touch him everywhere at once, to feel him touching her 
everywhere at once. He would give up everything to go with her. 

She twined her arms around his neck, her mouth meeting his in a second 
kiss that knocked the world out from under her. 


She didn't know how long they stood on that roof, tangled up in each other, 
mouths and hands roving until she moaned and dragged him through the 
greenhouse, down the stairs, and into the carriage waiting outside. And then 
there was the ride home, where he did things to her neck and ear that made 
her forget her own name. They managed to straighten themselves out as they 
reached the castle gates, and kept a respectable distance as they walked back 
to her room, though every inch of her felt so alive and burning that it was a 
miracle she made it back to her door without pulling him into a closet. 

But then they were inside her rooms, and then at her bedroom door, and he 
paused as she took his hand to lead him in. "Are you sure?" 

She lifted a hand to his face, exploring every curve and freckle that had 
become so impossibly precious to her. She had waited once before--waited 
with Sam, and then it had been too late. But now, there was no doubt, no 


shred of fear or uncertainty, as if every moment between her and Chaol had 
been a step ina dance that had led to this threshold. 

"T've never been so sure of anything in my life," she told him. His eyes 
blazed with hunger that matched her own, and she kissed him again, tugging 
him into her bedroom. He let her pull him, not breaking the kiss as he kicked 
the door shut behind them. 

And then there was only them, and skin against skin, and when they 
reached that moment when there was nothing more between them at all, 
Celaena kissed Chaol deeply and gave him everything she had. 


Celaena awoke as dawn poured into her room. Chaol still held her to him, 
just as he had all night, as if she would somehow slip away during sleep. She 
smiled to herself, pressing her nose against his neck and breathing him in. He 
shifted, just enough for her to know that he'd awoken. 

His hands began moving, twining themselves in her hair. "There's no way 
in hell I'm getting out of this bed and going for a run," he murmured onto her 
head. She chuckled quietly. His hands grazed lower, down her back, not even 
stumbling over the scar tissue. He'd kissed every scar on her back, on her 
entire body, last night. She smiled against his neck. "How are you feeling?" 

Like she was everywhere and nowhere all at once. Like she'd somehow 
been half-blind all her life and could now see everything clearly. Like she 
could stay here forever and be content. "Tired," she admitted. He tensed. 
"But happy." 

She almost whined when he let go of her long enough to prop himself up 
on an elbow and stare down at her face. "You're all right, though?" 

She rolled her eyes. "I'm pretty certain 'tired, but happy' is a normal 
reaction after one's first time." And she was pretty certain she'd have to talk 
to Philippa about a contraceptive tonic as soon as she dragged herself out of 
bed. Because Gods above, a baby ... She snorted. 

"What?" 

She just shook her head, smiling. "Nothing." She ran her fingers through 
his hair. A thought hit her, and her smile faded. "How much trouble will you 
get in for this?" 

She watched his muscled chest expand as he took a deep breath, dipping 
his head to rest his brow on her shoulder. "I don't know. Maybe the king 


won't care. Maybe he'll dismiss me. Maybe worse. It's hard to tell; he's 
unpredictable like that." 

She chewed her lip and ran her hands down his powerful back. She'd 
longed to touch him like this for so long--longer than she'd realized. "Then 
we'll keep it secret. We spend enough time together that no one should notice 
the change." 

He lifted himself again, peering into her eyes. "I don't want you to think 
I'm agreeing to keep it secret because I'm ashamed in any way." 

"Who said anything about shame?" She gestured down to her naked body, 
even though it was covered by the blanket. "Honestly, I'm surprised you're 
not strutting about, boasting to everyone. 7 certainly would be if Pd tumbled 
me." 

"Does your love for yourself know no bounds?" 

"Absolutely none." He leaned down to nip at her ear, and her toes curled. 
"We can't tell Dorian," she said quietly. "He'll figure it out, I bet, but ... I 
don't think we should tell him outright." 

He paused his nibbling. "I know." But then he pulled back, and she 
winced inwardly as he studied her again. "Do you still--" 

"No. Not for a long while." The relief in his eyes made her kiss him. "But 
he'd be another complication if he knew." And there was no telling how he'd 
react, given how tense things had been between them. He was important 
enough in Chaol's life that she didn't want to ruin that relationship. 

"So," he said, flicking her nose, "how long have you wanted--" 

"I don't see how that's any of your business, Captain Westfall. And I 
won't tell you until you tell me." 

He flicked her nose again, and she batted away his fingers. He caught her 
hand in his, holding it up so he could look at her amethyst ring--the ring she 
never took off, not even to bathe. "The Yulemas ball. Maybe earlier. Maybe 
even Samhuinn, when I brought you this ring. But Yulemas was the first time I 
realized I didn't like the idea of you with--with someone else." He kissed 
the tips of her fingers. "Your turn." 

"Pm not telling you," she said. Because she had no idea; she was still 
figuring out when it had happened, exactly. It somehow felt as if it had 
always been Chaol, even from the very beginning, even before they'd ever 
met. He began to protest, but she pulled him back down on top of her. "And 


that's enough talking. I might be tired, but there are still plenty of things to do 
instead of going for a run." 

The grin Chaol gave her was hungry and wicked enough that she shrieked 
when he yanked her under the blankets. 


Chapter 24 


Dorian walked past the black tents of the carnival, wondering for the 
umpteenth time if this was the greatest mistake of his life. He'd lost the nerve 
to come yesterday, but after yet another sleepless night, he'd decided to see 
the old witch and deal with the consequences later. If he wound up on the 
executioner's block because of it, he'd surely kick himself for being so 
brash, but he had exhausted every other way of finding out why he was 
plagued by magic. This was his only option. 

He found Baba Yellowlegs sitting on the back steps of her giant wagon, a 
chipped plate heaped with roast chicken parts resting on her knees, a pile of 
clean-licked bones littering the ground below. 

She lifted her yellowed eyes to him, iron teeth glinting in the noontime sun 
as she bit into a chicken leg. "Carnival's closed for lunch." 

He swallowed his irritation. Getting answers relied on two things: being 
on her good side, and her not knowing who he was. 

"T was hoping you'd have a few moments to answer some questions." 

The chicken leg cracked in two. He tried not to cringe at the slurping 
sounds as she sucked out the marrow. "Customers who have questions during 
lunch pay double." 

He reached into his pocket and fished out the four gold coins he'd brought. 
"I hope this will buy me all the questions I want--and your discretion." 

She chucked the clean half of the leg onto the pile and set to work on the 
other, sucking and gnawing. "I bet you wipe your ass with gold." 

"I don't think that would be very comfortable." 

Baba Yellowlegs hissed a laugh. "Very well, lordling. Let's hear your 
questions." 

He leaned in close enough to set his gold on the top step beside her, 
keeping well away from her withered form. She smelled atrocious, like 
mildew and rotted blood. But he kept his face blank and bored as he pulled 
back. The gold vanished with a swipe of a gnarled hand. 

Dorian glanced around. Workers were scattered throughout the carnival, 
all of them settled down for the midday meal wherever they could find seats. 


None of them, he noticed, sat anywhere near the black-painted wagon. They 
didn't even look this way. 

"Youre truly a witch?" 

She picked up a chicken wing. Crack. Crunch. "The lastborn witch of the 
Witch Kingdom." 

"That would make you over five hundred years old." 

She gave hima smile. "It's a marvel I've stayed so young, isn't it?" 

"So it's true: witches really are blessed with the long lifespans of the 
Fae." 

She tossed another bone at the foot of the wooden steps. "Fae or Valg. We 
never learned which one." 

Valg. He knew that name. "The demons who stole Fae to breed with them; 
which made the witches, right?" And, if he recalled correctly, the beautiful 
Crochan witches had taken after their Fae ancestors--while the three clans of 
Ironteeth witches took after the race of demons that had invaded Erilea at the 
dawn of time. 

"Why would a lordling as pretty as you bother yourself with such wicked 
stories?" She peeled the skin off the breast of the chicken and guzzled it 
down, smacking her withered lips together. 

"When we're not wiping our asses with gold, we need to find some way 
to amuse ourselves. Why not learn a little history?" 

"Indeed," the witch said. "So, are you going to dance around it all day 
while I bake in this miserable sun, or are you going to ask what you really 
came here to learn?" 

"Is magic truly gone?" 

She didn't even look up from her plate. "Your kind of magic is gone, yes. 
But there are other, forgotten powers that work." 

"What sort of powers?" 

"Powers that lordlings have no business knowing. Now ask your next 
question." 

He gave her a playful, wounded face that had the old woman rolling her 
eyes. She made him want to run in the other direction, but he had to get 
through this, had to keep up the charade for as long as he could. 

"Could one person somehow have magic?" 

"Boy, I've traveled from one shore of this continent to the other, across 
every mountain, and into the dark, shadowy places where men still fear to 


tread. There is no magic left anymore; even the surviving Fae can't access 
their powers. Some of them remain trapped in their animal forms. Miserable 
wretches. Taste like animals, too." She laughed, a crow's caw that made the 
hair on the back of his neck rise. "So, no--one person could not be the 
exception to the rule." 

He kept up his careful mask of idle boredom. "And if someone discovered 
that they suddenly had magic ...?" 

"Then they'd be a damn fool, and asking for a hanging." 

He already knew that. That wasn't what he was asking. "But if it were 
true--hypothetically. How would that even be possible?" 

She paused her eating, cocking her head. Her silver hair gleamed like 
fresh snow, off setting her tanned face. "We don't know how or why magic 
vanished. I hear rumors every now and then that the power still exists on 
other continents, but not here. So that's the real question: why did magic 
vanish only here, and not across the whole of Erilea? What crimes did we 
commit to make the gods curse us like that, to take away what they had once 
given us?" She tossed the rib cage of the chicken onto the ground. 
"Hypothetically, if someone had magic and I wanted to learn why, Id start 
by figuring out why magic left in the first place. Maybe that would explain 
how there could be an exception to the rule." She licked the grease off her 
deadly fingers. "Strange questions from a lordling dwelling in the glass 
castle. Strange, strange questions." 

He gave her a half grin. "Stranger still that the lastborn witch of the Witch 
Kingdom would stoop low enough to spend her life doing carnival tricks." 

"The gods that cursed these lands ten years ago damned the witches 
centuries before that." 

It might have been the clouds that passed over the sun, but he could have 
sworn that he saw a darkness gleaming in her eyes--a darkness that made 
him wonder if she was even older than she let on. Perhaps her "lastborn 
witch" title was a lie. A fabrication to conceal a history so violent that he 
couldn't imagine the horrors she'd committed during those long-ago witch 
wars. 

Against his will, he found himself reaching for the ancient force 
slumbering inside him, wondering if it would somehow shield him from 
Yellowlegs the way it had from the shattering window. The thought made him 
queasy. 


"Any other questions?" she said, licking her iron nails. 

"No. Thank you for your time." 

"Bah," she spat, and waved him off. 

He walked away, and got no farther than the nearest tent when he saw the 
sun glinting off a golden head, and Roland walked toward him, away from 
the table where he'd been talking to that stunning blond musician who'd 
played the lute the other night. Had he followed him here? Dorian frowned, 
but gave his cousin a nod in greeting as Roland fell into step beside him. 

"Getting your fortune read?" 

Dorian shrugged. "I was bored." 

Roland looked over his shoulder to where Baba Yellowlegs's caravan 
wagon was parked. "That woman makes my blood run cold." 

Dorian snorted. "I think that's one of her talents." 

Roland glanced at him sidelong. "Did she tell you anything interesting?" 

"Just the normal nonsense: P11 soon meet my true love, a glorious destiny 
awaits me, and I'Il be rich beyond imagining. I don't think she knew who she 
was talking to." He surveyed the Lord of Meah. "And what are you doing 
here?" 

"I saw you heading out and thought you might want company. But then I 
saw where you were going and decided to keep well away." 

Either Roland was spying on him, or he was telling the truth; Dorian 
honestly couldn't tell. But he'd made a point to be pleasant to his cousin 
during the past few days--and at every council meeting, Roland had backed 
whatever decision Dorian made without hesitation. The irritation on 
Perrington and his father's faces was an unexpected delight, too. 

So Dorian didn't question Roland about why he'd followed him, but when 
he glanced back at Baba Yellowlegs, he could have sworn the old woman 
was grinning at him. 


It had been a few days since Celaena had tracked her targets. Cloaked in 
darkness, she stood in the shadows of the docks, not quite believing what she 
was seeing. All the men on her list, all the ones she'd been following, the 
ones who might know what the king was up to--were leaving. She'd seen 
one of them sneak into an unmarked carriage and had followed him here, 
where he'd boarded a ship set to depart at the midnight tide. And then, to her 


dismay, the other three had shown up, too, their families in tow, before they 
were quickly ushered belowdecks. 

All those men, all that information she'd been gathering, just-- 

"Pm sorry," a familiar voice said behind her, and she whirled to find 
Archer approaching. How was he so stealthy? She hadn't even heard him 
getting close. "I had to warn them," he said, his eyes on the ship getting ready 
to depart. "I couldn't live with their blood on my hands. They have children; 
what would become of them if you handed over their parents to the king?" 

She hissed, "Did you organize this?" 

"No," he said softly, the words barely audible above the shouts of the 
sailors untying the ropes and readying the oars. "A member of the 
organization did. I mentioned that their lives might be in jeopardy, and he had 
his men get them on the next ship out of Rifthold." 

She put a hand on her dagger. "Part of this bargain relies on you giving me 
useful information." 

"T know. I'm sorry." 

"Would you rather I just faked your death now and put you on that ship as 
well?" Perhaps she'd find another way to convince the king to release her 
earlier. 

"No. This won't happen again." 

She highly doubted that, but she leaned back against the wall of the 
building and crossed her arms, watching Archer observe the ship. After a 
moment, he turned to her. "Say something." 

"I don't have anything to say. I'm too busy debating whether I should just 
kill you and drag your carcass before the king." She wasn't bluffing. After 
last night with Chaol, she was starting to wonder whether simplicity would 
be best. Anything to keep Chaol from getting ensnared in a potential mess. 

"Tm sorry," Archer said again, but she waved him off and watched the 
readying ship. 

It was impressive that they'd organized an escape so quickly. Perhaps they 
weren't all fools like Davis. "The person you mentioned this to," she said 
after a while. "He's a leader of the group?" 

"I think so," Archer said quietly. "Or high up enough that when I dropped 
the hint about these men, he was able to organize an escape immediately." 

She chewed on the inside of her cheek. Perhaps Davis had been a fluke. 
And maybe Archer was right. Maybe these men just wanted a ruler who 


would better suit their tastes. But whatever their financial and political 
motives might be, when innocent people had been threatened, they'd 
mobilized and gotten them to safety. Few people in the empire dared to do 
that--and fewer still were getting away with it. 

"I want new names and more information by tomorrow night," she told 
Archer as she turned away from the docks, heading back toward the castle. 
"Or else Pll toss your head at the king's feet and let him decide whether he 
wants me to dump it in the sewer or spike it on the front gates." She didn't 
wait for Archer's reply before she faded into the shadows and fog. 

She took her time going back to the castle, thinking about what she'd seen. 
There was never absolute good or absolute evil (though the king was 
definitely the exception). And even if these men were corrupt in some ways, 
they were also saving lives. 

While it was absurd that they claimed to have contact with Aelin 
Galathynius, she couldn't help but wonder if there really were forces 
gathering in the heir's name. If somewhere, in the past decade, members of 
the powerful royal court of Terrasen had managed to hide. Thanks to the King 
of Adarlan, Terrasen no longer had a standing army--yjust whatever forces 
were camped throughout the kingdom. But those men did have some 
resources. And Nehemia had said that if Terrasen ever got to its feet again, it 
would pose a real threat to Adarlan. 

So maybe she wouldn't even have to do anything. Maybe she wouldn't 
have to risk her life, or Chaol's. Maybe, just maybe, whatever their motives, 
these people could find a way to stop the king--and free all of Erilea as 
well. 

A slow, reluctant smile spread across her face, and it only grew wider as 
she walked to the glowing glass castle, and to the Captain of the Guard who 
awaited her there. 





It had been four days since Chaol's birthday, and he'd spent every night since 
then with Celaena. And afternoons, and mornings. And every moment they 
could spare from their individual obligations. Unfortunately, this meeting 
with his chief guards wasn't optional, but as he listened to the men's reports, 
his thoughts kept drifting back to her. 


He'd barely breathed during that first time, and he'd done his best to be 
gentle, to make it as painless for her as possible. She'd still winced, and her 
eyes had gleamed with tears, but when he'd asked if she needed to stop, 
she'd just kissed him. Again and again. All through that first night he'd held 
her and allowed himself to imagine that this was how every night for the rest 
of his life would be. 

And every night since then, he'd traced the scars down her back, silently 
swearing oath after oath that someday, he'd go back to Endovier and rip that 
place down stone by stone. 

"Captain?" 

Chaol blinked, realizing someone had asked him a question, and shifted in 
his chair. "Say that again," he ordered, refusing to let himself blush. 

"Do we need extra guards at the carnival?" 

Hell, he didn't even know why they were asking that. Had there been 
some incident? If he asked, then they'd definitely know he hadn't been 
listening. 

He was spared from looking like a fool when someone knocked on the 
door to the small meeting room in the barracks, and then a golden head 
popped in. 

Just seeing her made him forget the world around them. Everyone in the 
room shifted to look at the door, and as she smiled, he fought the urge to 
smash in the faces of the guards who looked at her so appreciatively. These 
were his men, he told himself. And she was beautiful--and she scared them 
half to death. Of course they would look, and appreciate. 

"Captain," she said, remaining on the threshold. There was color high on 
her cheeks that set her eyes sparkling, making him think of how she looked 
when they were tangled up with each other. She inclined her head toward the 
hall. "The king wants to see you." 

He would have felt a jolt of nerves, would have started to think the worst, 
had he not caught that glimmer of mischief in her eyes. 

He stood from his seat, bowing his head to his men. "Decide among 
yourselves about the carnival, and report back to me later," he said, and 
quickly left the room. 

He kept a respectable distance until they rounded a corner into an empty 
hallway and he stepped closer, needing to touch her. 

"Philippa and the servants are gone until dinner," she said huskily. 


He ground his teeth at the effect her voice had on him, like someone 
dragging an invisible finger down his spine. "I've got meetings for the rest of 
the day," he managed to say. It was true. "I've got another one in twenty 
minutes." Which he'd surely be late for if he followed her, considering how 
long it would take to walk to her rooms. 

She paused, frowning at him. But his eyes drifted to the small wooden 
door just a few feet away. A broom closet. She followed his attention, and a 
slow smile spread across her face. She turned toward it, but he grabbed her 
hand, bringing his face close to hers. "You're going to have to be very quiet." 

She reached the knob and opened the door, tugging him inside. "I have a 
feeling that /'m going to be telling you that in a few moments," she purred, 
eyes gleaming with the challenge. 

Chaol's blood roared through him, and he followed her into the closet and 
wedged a broom beneath the handle. 


"A broom closet?" Nehemia said, grinning like a fiend. "Really?" 

Celaena lay sprawled on Nehemia's bed and tossed a chocolate-covered 
raisin into her mouth. "I swear it on my life." 

Nehemia leapt onto the mattress. Fleetfoot jumped up beside her and 
practically sat on Celaena's face as she wagged her tail at the princess. 

Celaena gently shoved the dog aside, and smiled so broadly that her face 
hurt. "Who knew I'd been missing out on such fun?" And gods above, Chaol 
was ... well, she blushed to think about just how much she enjoyed him after 
her body had adjusted. Just the touch of his fingers on her skin could turn her 
into a feral beast. 

"I could have told you that," Nehemia said, reaching over Celaena to grab 
a chocolate from the dish on the nightstand. "Though I think the real question 
is, who would have guessed that the solemn Captain of the Guard could be so 
passionate?" She lay down beside Celaena, also smiling. "I'm happy for you, 
my friend." 

Celaena smiled back. "I think ... I think I'm happy for me, too." 

And she was. For the first time in years, she was truly happy. The feeling 
curled around every thought, a tendril of hope that grew with each breath. 
She was afraid to look at it for too long, as though acknowledging it would 
somehow cause it to disappear. Perhaps the world would never be perfect, 


perhaps some things would never be right, but maybe she stood a chance of 
finding her own sort of peace and freedom. 

She felt the shift in Nehemia before the princess even said a word, like a 
current in the air somehow chilled. Celaena looked over to find Nehemia 
staring up at the ceiling. "What's wrong?" 

Nehemia ran a hand over her face, letting out a deep breath. "The king has 
asked me to speak to the rebel forces. To convince them to back down. Or 
else he'll butcher them all." 

"He threatened to do that?" 

"Not directly, but it was implied. At the end of the month, he's sending 
Perrington to the duke's keep in Morath. I don't doubt for one minute that he 
wants Perrington at the southern border so he can monitor things. Perrington 
is his right hand. So if the duke decides the rebels need to be dealt with, he 
has permission to use whatever force is necessary to put them down." 

Celaena sat up, folding her legs beneath her. "So you're going back to 
Eyllwe?" 

Nehemia shook her head. "I don't know. I need to be here. There are ... 
there are things that I need to do here. In this castle and in this city. But I 
cannot abandon my people to another massacre." 

"Can your parents or your brothers deal with the rebels?" 

"My brothers are too young and untried, and my parents have enough on 
their hands in Banjali." The princess sat up, and Fleetfoot rested her head on 
Nehemia's lap, stretching out between them--and giving Celaena a few kicks 
with her hind legs in the process. "I have grown up knowing the weight of my 
crown. When the king invaded Eyllwe all those years ago, I knew that I 
would someday have to make choices that would haunt me." She cupped her 
forehead in a palm. "I didn't think it would be this hard. I cannot be in two 
places at once." 

Celaena's chest tightened, and she put a hand on Nehemia's back. 

No wonder Nehemia had been so slow about looking into the eye riddle. 
Shame colored her cheeks. 

"What will I do, Elentiya, if he kills another five hundred people? What 
will I do if he decides to set an example by butchering everyone in 
Calaculla? How can I turn my back on them?" 

Celaena had no answer. She'd spent the week lost in thoughts of Chaol. 
Nehemia had spent her week trying to balance the fate of her kingdom. And 


Celaena had clues littering the ground at her feet--clues that might help 
Nehemia in her cause against the king, and a command from Elena that she'd 
practically ignored. 

Nehemia took her hand. "Promise me," she said, her dark eyes shining. 
"Promise me that yov' ll help me free Eyllwe from him." 

Ice shot through Celaena's veins. "Free Eyllwe?" 

"Promise me that you'll see my father's crown restored to him. That 
you'll see my people returned from Endovier and Calaculla." 

"T'm just an assassin." Celaena pulled her hand out of Nehemia's. "And 
the kind of thing you're talking about, Nehemia ..." She got off the bed, trying 
to control her rapid heartbeat. "That would be madness." 

"There is no other way. Eyllwe must be freed. And with you helping me, 
we could start to gather a host to--" 

"No." Nehemia blinked, but Celaena shook her head. "No," she repeated. 
"Not for all the world would I help you muster an army against him. Eyllwe 
has been hit hard by the king, but you barely got a taste of the kind of brutality 
he unleashed elsewhere. You raise a force against him, and he'll butcher you. 
I won't be a part of that." 

"So what will you be a part of, Celaena?" Nehemia stood, jostling 
Fleetfoot from her lap. "What will you stand for? Or will you only stand for 
yourself?" 

Her throat ached, but Celaena forced the words out. "You have no idea 
what sort of things he can do to you, Nehemia. To your people." 

"He massacred five hundred rebels and their families!" 

"And he destroyed my entire kingdom! You daydream about the power 
and honor of Terrasen's royal court, yet you don't realize what it means that 
the king was able to destroy them. They were the strongest court on the 
continent--they were the strongest court on any continent, and he killed them 
all." 

"He had the element of surprise," Nehemia countered. 

"And now he has an army that numbers in the millions. There is nothing 
that can be done." 

"When will you say enough, Celaena? What will make you stop running 
and face what is before you? If Endovier and the plight of my people cannot 
move you, what will?" 

"I am one person." 


"One person chosen by Queen Elena--one person whose brow burned 
with a sacred mark on the day of that duel! One person who, despite the 
odds, is still breathing. Our paths crossed for a reason. If you are not gods- 
blessed, then who is?" 

"This is ridiculous. This is folly." 

"Folly? Folly to fight for what is right, for people who cannot stand up for 
themselves? You think soldiers are the worst he can send?" Nehemia's tone 
softened. "There are far darker things gathering on the horizon. My dreams 
have been filled with shadows and wings--the booming of wings soaring 
between mountain passes. And every scout and spy we send into the White 
Fang Mountains, into the Ferian Gap, does not come back. Do you know 
what the people say in the valleys below? They say they can hear wings, too, 
riding the winds through the Gap." 

"I don't understand a word you're saying." But Celaena had seen that 
thing outside the library. 

Nehemia stalked to her, grabbing her by the wrists. "You do understand. 
When you look at him, you sense that there is a greater, twisted power around 
him. How did such a man conquer so much of the continent so quickly? With 
military might alone? How is it that Terrasen's court fell so quickly, when its 
retainers had been trained for generations to be warriors? How did the most 
powerful court in the world get wiped out within a matter of days?" 

"Youre tired and upset," Celaena said as calmly as she could, trying not 
to think of how similar Nehemia's and Elena's words were. She shook off the 
princess's grip. "Maybe we should talk about this later--" 

"I don't want to talk about this later!" 

Fleetfoot whined, wedging herself between them. 

"If we do not strike now," Nehemia went on, "then whatever he is 
brewing will only grow more powerful. And then we will be beyond any 
chance of hope." 

"There is no hope," Celaena said. "There is no hope in standing against 
him. Not now, not ever." That was a truth she'd slowly been realizing. If 
Nehemia and Elena were right about this mysterious power source, then how 
could they ever overthrow him? "And I will not be a part of whatever plan 
you have. I will not help you get yourself killed, and bring down even more 
innocent people in the process." 

"You will not help because all you care about is yourself." 


"And so what if I do?" Celaena splayed her arms. "So what if I want to 
spend the rest of my life in peace?" 

"There can never be any peace--not while he reigns. When you said you 
weren't killing the men on his list, I thought you were finally taking a step 
toward making a stand. I thought that when the time came, I could count on 
you to help me start planning. I didn't realize that you were doing it just to 
keep your own conscience clean!" 

Celaena began storming toward the door. 

Nehemia clicked her tongue. "I didn't realize that you're just a coward." 

Celaena looked over her shoulder. "Say that again." 

Nehemia didn't flinch. "You're a coward. You are nothing more than a 
coward." 

Celaena's fingers clenched into fists. "When your people are lying dead 
around you," she hissed, "don't come crying to me." 

She didn't give the princess the chance to reply before she stalked out of 
the room, Fleetfoot close on her heels. 


Chapter 25 


"One of them has to break," the queen said to the princess. "Only then can it 
begin." 

"I know," the princess said softly. "But the prince isn't ready. It has to be 
her." 

"Then do you understand what I am asking of you?" 

The princess looked up, toward the shaft of moonlight spilling into the 
tomb. When she looked back at the ancient queen, her eyes were bright. 
"Yes." 

"Then do what needs to be done." 

The princess nodded and walked out of the tomb. She paused on the 
threshold, the darkness beyond beckoning to her, and turned back to the 
queen. "She won't understand. And when she goes over the edge, there will 
be nothing to pull her back." 

"She will find her way back. She always does." 

Tears formed, but the princess blinked them away. "For all our sakes, I 
hope you're right." 


Chapter 26 


Chaol hated hunting parties. Many of the lords could barely handle a bow, let 
alone be stealthy. It was painful to watch them--and the poor hounds bursting 
through the brush, trying to scatter game that the lords would miss anyway. 
Usually, just to get things over with, he would discreetly kill a few animals 
and then pretend Lord So-and-So had done it. But the king, Perrington, 
Roland, and Dorian were all out in the game park today, which meant he had 
to keep close to them. 

Whenever he rode close enough to the lords to overhear their laughing and 
gossiping and harmless scheming, he sometimes let himself wonder if that 
was how he would have wound up had he not chosen this path. He hadn't 
seen his younger brother in years; had his father allowed Terrin to turn into 
one of these idiots? Or had his father sent him to train as a warrior, as all 
lords of Anielle had done in the centuries after the wild mountain men had 
preyed upon the city on the Silver Lake? 

As Chaol trailed behind the king, his new Asterion stallion earning many 
admiring and envious glances from the hunting party, Chaol allowed himself 
to consider--for one heartbeat--what his father would make of Celaena. His 
mother was a gentle, quiet woman, whose face had become a blurred 
memory in the years since he'd last seen her. But he still remembered her 
lilting voice and soft laugh, and the way she'd sung him to sleep when he was 
ill. Even though their marriage had been arranged, his father had wanted 
someone like his mother--someone submissive. Which meant that someone 
like Celaena ... He cringed to even consider his father and Celaena in a 
room together. Cringed, and then smiled, because that was a battle of wills 
that could go down in legend. 

"You're distracted today, Captain," the king said as he emerged from 
between the trees. He was massive; the king's size always surprised Chaol, 
for some reason. 

He was flanked by two of Chaol's guards--one of which was Ress, who 
looked more nervous than triumphant at being selected to protect the king 
today, though he was trying his hardest not to show it. It was why Chaol had 
also chosen Dannan, the other guard--older and weathered and possessing 
near-legendary patience. Chaol bowed to his sovereign, and then gave Ress a 


slight nod of approval. The young guard sat up straighter, but remained alert 
--his focus now upon their surroundings, the lords riding nearby, the sounds 
of dogs and arrows. 

The king pulled his black horse alongside Chaol's, falling into a 
meandering walk. Ress and Dannan fell back a respectable pace, still close 
enough to intercept any lurking threat. "Whatever will my lords do without 
you to kill their quarry for them?" 

Chaol tried to hide his smile. Perhaps he hadn't been as discreet as he 
thought. "Apologies, milord." 

Atop his warhorse, the king looked every inch the conqueror he was. 
There was something in his eyes that sent a chill down Chaol's spine--and 
made him realize why so many foreign rulers had offered him their crowns 
instead of facing him in battle. 

"I am having the Princess of Eyllwe questioned in my council room 
tomorrow night," the king said quietly enough that only Chaol could hear, 
turning his stallion to follow after the pack of hounds that rushed through the 
thawing woods. "I want six men outside the room. Make sure there are no 
complications or interruptions." The look the king gave him suggested 
exactly the sort of complication he had in mind--Celaena. 

Chaol knew it was risky to ask questions, but he said, "Is there anything 
specific that I should prepare my men for?" 

"No," the king said, nocking an arrow to his bow and firing at a pheasant 
that surged up from the brush. A clean shot--right through the eye. "That will 
be all." 

The king whistled to his hounds and followed after the prey he'd killed, 
Ress and Dannan close behind. 

Chaol stilled his stallion, watching the mountain of a man ride through the 
thicket. "What was that about?" Dorian said, suddenly beside him. 

Chaol shook his head. "Nothing." 

Dorian reached over his shoulder to the quiver strapped there and drew 
an arrow. "I haven't seen you for a few days." 

"Pve been busy." Busy with his duties, and busy with Celaena. "I haven't 
seen you around, either." He made himself meet Dorian's gaze. 

Dorian's lips were pursed, his face stony as he quietly said, "I've been 
busy, too." The Crown Prince turned his horse away, heading in another 


direction, but paused. "Chaol," he said, looking over his shoulder. Dorian's 
eyes were frozen, his jaw clenched. "Treat her well." 

"Dorian," he started, but the prince rode off to join Roland. Suddenly 
alone in the teeming forest, Chaol watched his friend disappear. 


Chaol didn't tell Celaena what the king had said, though part of him twisted 
until it hurt. The king wouldn't hurt Nehemia--not when she was such a 
public and well-liked figure. Not when he'd warned Chaol about that 
anonymous threat to Nehemia's life. But he had a feeling that whatever was 
going to be said in the council room wasn't going to be pleasant. 

Celaena knowing or not knowing made no difference, he told himself as 
he lay curled around her in his bed. Even if Celaena knew, even if she told 
Nehemia, it wouldn't stop the conversation from taking place, and it 
wouldn't make the nameless threat go away. No, it would just make things 
worse if they knew--worse for all of them. 

Chaol sighed, untangling his legs from Celaena's as he sat up and grabbed 
his pants from where he'd thrown them on the floor. She stirred, but didn't 
move. That was a miracle in itself, he realized--that she felt safe enough to 
sleep soundly with him. 

He paused to gently kiss her head, then picked up the rest of his clothes 
from around the room and dressed, even though the clock had chimed only 
three not long ago. 

Perhaps it was a test, he thought as he slipped out the door of his 
chambers. Perhaps the king was testing Chaol to see where his loyalties lay 
--if he could still trust him. And if he learned that Celaena and Nehemia 
were aware of the interrogation tomorrow, then there would be only one way 
for them to have learned ... 

He just needed some fresh air, to feel the briny breeze off the Avery on his 
face. He'd meant it when he told Celaena about someday leaving Rifthold 
with her. And he'd go to his death defending her secret about the men she 
wasn't killing. 

Chaol reached the dark, silent gardens and strode between the hedges. 
He'd kill any man who hurt Celaena; and if the king ever gave him the order 
to dispatch her, then he'd plunge his sword into his own heart before he 
would obey. His soul was bound to hers by some unbreakable chain. He 


snorted, imagining what his father would think when he learned that Chaol 
had taken Adarlan's Assassin for his wife. 

The thought stopped Chaol dead in his tracks. She was only eighteen. He 
forgot that sometimes, forgot that he was older than her, too. And if he asked 
her to marry him right now ... "Gods above," he muttered, shaking his head. 
That day was a long way off. 

But he couldn't help imagining 1t--the glimmer of the future and how it 
would be to forge a life together, to call her his wife, to hear her call him 
husband, to raise a brood of children who would probably be far too clever 
and talented for their own good (and for Chaol's sanity). 

He was still envisioning that impossibly beautiful future when someone 
grabbed him from behind and pressed something cold and reeking against his 
nose and mouth, and the world went black. 


Chapter 27 


Chaol wasn't in his bed when she awoke, and Celaena thanked the gods for 
their small mercies, because she was certainly too worn out to bother 
running. His side of the bed was cold enough that she knew he'd left hours 
before--probably to fulfill his duties as Captain of the Guard. 

She lay there for a while, content to daydream, to imagine a time when 
they could have whole, uninterrupted days with each other. When her 
stomach started growling, she decided it was a sign that she should drag 
herself out of bed. She'd taken to leaving some clothes in his room, so she 
bathed and dressed before returning to her own chambers. 

Over breakfast, a list of names arrived from Archer--written in code, as 
she'd asked--with more men to hunt down. She just hoped he wouldn't 
squeal on her again. Nehemia didn't show up for their daily lesson on the 
Wyrdmarks, though Celaena wasn't surprised by that, either. 

She didn't particularly feel like talking to her friend--and if the princess 
was foolish enough to think of starting a rebellion ... She'd stay well enough 
away from Nehemia until she came to her senses. It did halt her hope of 
finding a way to use the Wyrdmarks to get through that secret door in the 
library, but that could wait--at least until both of their tempers had cooled. 

After spending the day in Rifthold stalking the men on Archer's list, 
Celaena returned to the castle, eager to tell Chaol what else she'd learned. 
But he didn't show up for dinner. It wasn't that unusual for him to be busy, so 
she dined alone, and curled up on the couch in her bedroom with a book. 

She probably needed some rest, too, since the Wyrd knew she hadn't been 
getting any sleep this past week. Not that she minded. 

When the clock struck ten and he still hadn't come to her, she found 
herself walking to his rooms. Perhaps he was waiting for her there. Perhaps 
he'd just fallen asleep without meaning to. 

But she hurried down the halls and stairs, her palms turning slicker with 
each step. Chaol was the Captain of the Guard. He held his own against her 
every day. He'd bested her in their first sparring match. Yet Sam had been 
her equal in many ways, too. And he'd still been caught and tortured by 





Rourke Farran--still died the most brutal death she'd ever seen. And if 
Chaol ... 

She was running now. 

Like Sam, Chaol was admired by almost everyone. And when they'd taken 
Sam from her, it hadn't been because of anything Sam had done. 

No, they'd done it to get at her. 

She reached his rooms, part of her still praying that she was just being 
paranoid, that he'd be sleeping in the bed, that she could curl up with him and 
make love to him and hold him through the night. 

But then she opened the door to his bedroom and saw a sealed note 
addressed to her on the table beside the door--placed atop his sword, which 
hadn't been there this morning. It was placed casually enough that the 
servants might have just assumed it was a note from Chaol himself--and that 
nothing was wrong. She ripped open the red seal and unfolded the paper. 


WE HAVE THE CAPTAIN. WHEN YOU'RE TIRED OF STALKING US, COME 
FIND US HERE. 


It listed the address for a warehouse in the slums of the city. 


BRING NO ONE, OR THE CAPTAIN WILL DIE BEFORE YOU SET FOOT IN 
THE BUILDING. IF YOU FAIL TO ARRIVE BY TOMORROW MORNING, WE'LL 
LEAVE WHAT'S LEFT OF HIM ON THE BANKS OF THE AVERY. 


She stared at the letter. 

Every one of the restraints she'd locked into place after she'd rampaged 
through Endovier snapped free. 

An icy, endless rage swept through her, wiping away everything except the 
plan that she could see with brutal clarity. The killing calm, Arobynn Hamel 
had once called it. Even he had never realized just how calm she could get 
when she went over the edge. 

If they wanted Adarlan's Assassin, they'd get her. 

And Wyrd help them when she arrived. 


Chaol didn't know why they'd chained him up, only that he was thirsty and 
had a pounding headache, and that the irons holding him against the stone 
wall weren't going to budge. They threatened to beat him every time he tried 


pulling against them. They'd already knocked him about enough to convince 
him they weren't bluffing. 

They. He didn't even know who they were. They all wore long robes and 
hoods that concealed their masked faces. Some of them were armed to the 
teeth. They spoke in murmurs, all of them growing increasingly on-edge as 
the day passed. 

From what he could tell, he had a split lip and would have some bruises 
on his face and ribs. They hadn't asked questions before unleashing two of 
their men on him, though he hadn't been entirely cooperative once he'd 
awoken and found himself here. Celaena would be impressed by just how 
creative his curses had been before, during, and after that initial beating. 

In the passing hours, he'd moved only once to relieve himself in the 
corner, since when he asked to use the washroom, they just stared at him. 
And they'd watched him the entire time, hands on their swords. He'd tried 
not to snort. 

They were waiting for something, he realized with a strange clarity as the 
day stretched into evening. The fact that they hadn't killed him yet suggested 
that they wanted some sort of ransom. 

Maybe it was a rebel group, seeking to blackmail the king. He'd heard of 
nobility being captured for that reason. And heard the king himself order the 
rebels to kill the petty lord or lady, because he would not yield to traitorous 
filth. 

Chaol didn't allow himself to consider that possibility, even as he began 
saving up his strength for whatever stand he'd make before he met his end. 

Some of his captors whispered in rapid arguments, but they were usually 
silenced by others who told them to wait. He was just pretending to doze off 
when another of these arguments occurred, a hissing back and forth about 
whether they should just free him, and then-- 

"She has until dawn. She' Il show up." 

She. 

That word was the worst thing he'd ever heard. 

Because there was only one she who would bother to show up for him. 
One she that he could be used against. 

"You hurt her," he said, his voice hoarse from a day without water, "and 
Pll rip you apart with my bare hands." 

There were thirty of them, half fully armed, and they all turned to him. 


He bared his teeth, even though his face ached. "You so much as touch 
her, and I'll gut you." 

One of them--tall, with two swords crossed over his back--approached. 
Even though his face was obscured, Chaol recognized him by his weapons as 
one of the men who had beaten him earlier. He stopped just beyond where 
Chaol's feet could kick. 

"Good luck with that," the man said. By his voice, he could have been 
anywhere from twenty to forty. "You'd better pray to whatever gods you 
favor that your little assassin cooperates." 

He growled, pulling against the chains. "What do you want from her?" 

The warrior--he was a warrior, Chaol could tell by the way he moved-- 
cocked his head. "None of your business, Captain. And keep your mouth shut 
when she arrives, or else P11 cut out your filthy royal tongue." 

Another clue. The man hated royals. Which meant that these people ... 

Had Archer known how dangerous this rebel group was? When he got 
free, he'd kill him for letting Celaena get tangled up with them. And then he'd 
make sure that the king and his secret guards got their hands on all of these 
bastards. 

Chaol yanked on the chains, and the man shook his head. "Do that, and P11 
knock you out again. For the Captain of the Royal Guard, you were far too 
easy to capture." 

Chaol's eyes flashed. "Only a coward captures men the way you did." 

"A coward? Or a pragmatist?" 

Not an uneducated warrior, then. Someone with schooling, if he could use 
vocabulary like that. 

"How about a damned fool?" Chaol said. "I don't think you realize who 
you're dealing with." 

The man clicked his tongue. "If you were that good, you would be more 
than the Captain of the Guard." 

Chaol let out a low, breathy laugh. "I wasn't talking about me." 

"She's just one girl." 

Though his guts were twisting at the thought of her in this place, with these 
people, though he was considering every possible way to get himself and 
Celaena out of here alive, he gave the man a grin. "Then you're really in for 
a surprise." 





Chapter 28 


Her rage took her to a place where she only knew three things: that Chaol had 
been taken from her, that she was a weapon forged to end lives, and that if 
Chaol was hurt, no one was going to walk out of that warehouse. 

She made it across the city quickly and efficiently, a predator's stealth 
keeping her steps quiet on the cobblestone streets. They'd told her to arrive 
alone, and she'd obeyed. 

But they hadn't said anything about arriving unarmed. 

So she'd taken every weapon she could fit onto her, including Chaol's 
sword, which was strapped across her back with a second sword of her own, 
the two hilts within easy reach over her shoulders. From there down, she was 
a living armory. 

When she neared the slums, her features concealed with a dark cloak and 
heavy hood, she scaled the side of a ramshackle building until she reached 
the roof. 

They hadn't said anything about using the front door of the warehouse, 
either. 

She stalked across the roofs, her supple boots finding easy purchase on 
the crumbling emerald shingles, listening, watching, fee/ing the mght around 
her. The usual sounds of the slums greeted her as she approached the 
enormous two-story warehouse: half-feral orphans screeching to each other, 
the splatter of drunks pissing against buildings, harlots calling out to 
prospective hires ... 

But there was a silence around the wooden warehouse, a bubble of quiet 
that told her the place had enough men out front that the usual slum denizens 
stayed away. 

The nearby rooftops were empty and flat, the gaps between buildings 
easily jumpable. 

She didn't care what this group wanted with her. She didn't care what sort 
of information they expected to twist from her. When they had taken Chaol, 
they'd made the biggest mistake of their lives. The last mistake, too. 

She reached the roof of the building beside the warehouse and dropped 
into a crawl before she reached the ledge and peered over. 


In the narrow alley directly below, three cloaked men patrolled. On the 
street beyond lay the front doors to the warehouse, light spilling from the 
cracks to reveal at least four men outside. No one was even looking at the 
roof. Fools. 

The wooden warehouse was a giant open space three stories high, and 
through the open second-level window in front of her, she could see all the 
way to the floor below. 

The mezzanine wrapped around much of the second level, and stairs led 
onto the third level and roof beyond--a possible escape route, if the front 
door wasn't an option. Ten of the men were heavily armed, and six archers 
were positioned around the wooden mezzanine, arrows all pointed at the first 
floor below. 

There was Chaol, chained to one of the wooden walls. 

Chaol, his face bruised and bleeding, his clothes ripped and dirty, his 
head hanging between his shoulders. 

The ice in her gut spread through her veins. 

She could scale the building to the roof, then come down from the third 
floor. But that would take time, and no one was looking at the open window 
before her. 

She tipped her head back and gave the moon a wicked smile. She'd been 
called Adarlan's Assassin for a reason. Dramatic entrances were practically 
her art form. 

Celaena eased back from the ledge and strode away a few paces, judging 
how far and fast she'd need to run. The open window was wide enough that 
she wouldn't need to worry about shattering glass or her swords catching on 
the frame, and the mezzanine had a guardrail to stop her if she overshot her 
landing. 

She had made a jump like this once before, on the night when her world 
had been shattered completely. But on that night, Sam had already been dead 
for days, and she'd leapt through the window of Rourke Farran's house for 
pure revenge. 

This time, she wouldn't fail. 

The men weren't even looking at the window when she hurtled through. 
And by the time she landed on the mezzanine and rolled into a crouch, two of 
her daggers were already flying. 


Chaol caught the glint of moonlight on steel in the heartbeat before she leapt 
through the second-level window, landing atop the mezzanine and hurling 
two daggers at the archers nearest to her. They went down, and she went up 
--two more daggers thrown at two more archers. He didn't know if he 
should watch them or watch her as she gripped the mezzanine railing and 
flipped over it, landing on the ground below just as several arrows struck 
where her hands had held the rail. 

The men in the room were shouting, some fleeing for the safety of pillars 
and the exit while others rushed at her, weapons drawn. And he could only 
watch in horror and awe as she drew two swords--one of them his--and 
unleashed herself upon them. 

They didn't stand a chance. 

In the fray of bodies, the remaining two archers didn't dare loose arrows 
that might hit one of their own--another intentional move on her part, he 
knew. Chaol yanked on his chains again and again, his wrists aching; if he 
could just get to her, the two of them could-- 

She was a whirlwind of steel and blood. As he watched her cut through 
the men as though they were stalks of wheat in a field, he understood how she 
had gotten so close to touching Endovier's wall that day. And at last--after 
all these months--he saw the lethal predator he'd expected to find in the 
mines. There was nothing human in her eyes, nothing remotely merciful. It 
froze his heart. 

The guard who had been taunting him all day remained nearby, twin 
swords drawn, waiting for her. 

One of the hooded men had gotten far enough away from her to start 
shouting: "Enough! Enough!" 

But Celaena didn't listen, and as Chaol hurled himself forward, still trying 
to dislodge the chains from the wall, she cleared a path through the men, 
leaving moaning bodies in her wake. To his credit, his tormentor stood his 
ground as she stalked toward him. 

"Don t shoot!" the hooded man was ordering the archers. "Don t shoot!" 

Celaena paused in front of the guard, pointing a blood-drenched sword at 
him. "Get out of my way, or I'll cut you into pieces." 

His guard, the fool, snorted, lifting his swords a little higher. "Come and 
get him." 


Celaena smiled. But then the hooded man with the ancient voice was 
rushing to them, arms spread to show he wasn't armed. "Enough! Put down 
your weapons," he told the guard. The guard faltered, but Celaena's swords 
remained at the ready. The old man took one step toward Celaena. "Enough! 
We have enough enemies as it is! There are worse things out there to face!" 

Celaena slowly turned to him, her face splattered with blood and eyes 
blazing bright. "No, there aren't," she said. "Because I'm here now." 


Blood that was not her own drenched her clothes, her hands, her neck, but all 
she could see were the archers ready on the mezzanine above her, and the foe 
still standing between her and Chaol. Her Chaol. 

"Please," the hooded man said, pulling off his hood and mask to reveal a 
face that matched his ancient voice. Short-cropped white hair, laugh lines 
around his mouth, and crystal-clear gray eyes that were wide with pleading. 
"Perhaps our methods were wrong, but--" 

She pointed a sword at him, and the masked guard between her and Chaol 
straightened. "I don't care who you are and what you want. I'm taking him 
now." 

"Please listen," the old man said softly. 

She could feel the ire and aggression rolling off the hooded guard in front 
of her, see how tightly, eagerly, he clutched the hilts of his twin swords. She 
wasn't ready for the bloodletting to end, either. She wasn't ready to give in at 
all. 

So she knew exactly what would happen when she turned to the guard and 
gave him a lazy grin. 

He charged. As she met his swords, the men who were outside burst in, 
steel flashing. And then there was nothing but metal ringing and the shouts of 
the injured going down around her, and she was soaring through them, 
delighting in the feral song that sang through her blood and bones. 

Someone was shouting her name, though--a familiar voice that wasn't 
Chaol's, and as she turned, she saw the flash of a steel-tipped arrow shooting 
for her, then a glint of golden-brown hair, and then-- 

Archer hit the ground, the arrow that was meant for her in his shoulder. It 
took all of two movements to drop one sword and draw the dagger from her 
boot, hurling it at the guard who had fired. By the time she looked at Archer, 


he was getting to his feet, putting himself between her and the wall of men, 
one arm splayed in front of her--facing her. Protecting the men. 

"This is a misunderstanding," he said to her, panting. Blood from the 
wound in his shoulder leaked down his black robes. Robes. The same robes 
that these men wore. 

Archer was a part of this group; Archer had set her up. 

And then that rage, the rage that blurred the events of the night she'd been 
captured with the events of this night, that made Chaol's and Sam's faces 
bleed together, seized her so fiercely that she reached for another dagger 
strapped to her waist. 

"Please," Archer said, taking a step toward her, wincing as the movement 
made the arrow shift. "Let me explain." As she saw the blood trickle down 
his robes, saw the agony and fear and desperation in his eyes, her rage 
flickered. 

"Unchain him," she said, her voice filled with deadly calm. "Now." 

Archer refused to break her stare. "Hear me out first." 

"Unchain him now." 

Archer jerked his chin to the guard who had foolishly launched the last 
attack against her. Limping, but surprisingly still in one piece, and, still 
possessing his twin blades, the guard slowly unshackled the Captain of the 
Guard. 

Chaol was on his feet in an instant, but she noted the way he swayed, the 
wince he tried to hide. Still, he managed to stare down the hooded guard who 
stood before him, eyes gleaming with the promise of violence. The guard just 
stepped back, reaching for his swords again. 

"You have one sentence to convince me not to kill you all," she said to 
Archer as Chaol came to her side. "One sentence." 

Archer began shaking his head, looking between her and Chaol, his eyes 
filled not with fear or anger or pleading, but sorrow. 

"I have been working with Nehemia to lead these people for the past six 
months." 

Chaol stiffened, but Celaena blinked. It was enough for Archer to know 
he'd passed the test. He jerked his head to the men around him. "Leave us," 
he said, his voice thundering with an authority she hadn't heard him use 
before. The men listened, those still on their feet dragging their injured 
companions away. She didn't let herself consider how many were dead. 





The old man who had exposed his face to her was staring with a mixture 
of awe and disbelief, and she wondered what sort of monster she looked at 
that moment. But when he noticed her attention, he bowed his head to her and 
left with the others, taking that impulsive, brash guard with him. 

Alone, she pointed her sword at Archer again, taking a step closer, 
keeping Chaol behind her. Of course, the Captain of the Guard stepped right 
up to her side. 

Archer said, "Nehemia and I have been leading this movement together. 
She came here to organize us--to assemble a group that could go into 
Terrasen and start gathering forces against the king. And to uncover what the 
king truly plans to do to Erilea." 

Chaol tensed, and Celaena clamped down on her surprise. "That's 
impossible." 

Archer snorted. "Is it? Why is it that the princess is so busy all the time? 
Do you know where she goes at night?" 

The frozen rage flickered again, slowing, slowing, slowing the world 
down. 

And then she remembered: remembered how Nehemia convinced her not 
to look into the riddle she'd found in Davis's office and had been so slow 
and forgetful about her promise to research the riddle; remembered the night 
Dorian had come to her rooms because Nehemia had been out, and he hadn't 
been able to find her anywhere in the castle; remembered Nehemia's words 
to her before their fight, about how she had important matters in Rifthold to 
look after, things as important as Eyllwe ... 

"She comes here," Archer said. "She comes here to feed us all of the 
information that you confide in her." 

"If she's part of your group," Celaena ground out, "then where is she?" 

Archer drew his word and pointed it at Chaol. "Ask him." 

A sharp pain twisted in her gut. "What is he talking about?" she asked 
Chaol. 

But Chaol was staring at Archer. "I don't know." 

"Lying bastard," Archer snapped, and bared his teeth with a savagery that 
made him, for once, look anything but attractive. "My sources told me that the 
king informed you over a week ago of the threat to Nehemia's life. When 
were you planning on telling anyone about that?" He turned to Celaena. "We 
brought him here because he was ordered to question Nehemia about her 


behavior. We wanted to know what kind of questions he'd been commanded 
to ask. And because we wanted you to see what sort of man he really is." 

"That's not true," Chaol spat. "That's a damned lie. You haven't asked me 
one thing, you gutter-born piece of filth." He turned pleading eyes to Celaena. 
The words were still sinking in, each more awful than the next. "I knew about 
the anonymous threat to Nehemia's life, yes. But I was told that she would be 
questioned by the king. Not me." 

"And we realized that,' Archer said. "Moments before you arrived, 
Celaena, we realized the captain wasn't the one. But it's not questioning that 
they're going to be doing tonight, is it, Captain?" Chaol didn't answer--and 
she didn't care why. 

She was pulling away from her body. Inch by inch. Like a tide ebbing 
from the shore. 

"I'll just sent men to the castle a moment ago," Archer went on. "Perhaps 
they can stop it." 

"Where is Nehemia?" she heard herself asking, from lips that felt far 
away. 

"That's what my spy discovered tonight. Nehemia insisted on staying in 
the castle, to see what kind of questions they wanted to ask her, to see how 
much they suspected and knew--" 

"Where is Nehemia? " 

But Archer just shook his head, his eyes bright with tears. "They aren't 
going to question her, Celaena. And by the time my men get there, I think it 
will be too late." 

Too late. 

Celaena turned to Chaol. His face was stricken and pale. 

Archer shook his head again. "I'm sorry." 


Chapter 29 


Celaena hurtled through the city streets, discarding her cloak and heavier 
weapons as she went, anything to give her additional speed, anything to get 
her back to the castle before Nehemia ... Before Nehemia-- 

A clock began sounding somewhere in the capital, and a lifetime passed 
between each booming peal. 

It was late enough that the streets were mostly deserted, but the people 
who saw her kept well out of her way as she sprinted past, her lungs nearly 
shattering. She pushed that pain away, willing strength into her legs, praying 
to whatever gods still cared to give her swiftness and strength. Who would 
the king use? If not Chaol, then who? 

She didn't care if it was the king himself. She'd destroy them. And that 
anonymous threat to Nehemia--she'd sort that out, too. 

The glass castle loomed closer, its crystalline towers glowing with a pale 
greenish light. 

Not again. Not again, she told herself with each step, each pound of her 
heart. Please. 

She couldn't take the front gate. The guards there would surely stop her or 
cause a ruckus that might prompt the unknown assassin to act faster. There 
was a high stone wall bordering one of the gardens; it was closer, and far 
less monitored. 

She could have sworn she heard hooves thundering after her, but there 
was nothing in the world except her and the distance to Nehemia. She neared 
the stone wall surrounding the garden, her blood roaring in her ears as she 
made a running jump for it. 

She hit the side as silently as she could, her fingers and feet immediately 
finding purchase, digging in so hard her fingernails cracked. She scrambled 
up and over the wall before the guards even looked her way. 

She landed on the gravel path of the garden, falling onto her hands. 
Somewhere in the back of her mind she registered pain in her palms, but she 
was already running again, careening toward the glass doors that led to the 
castle. Patches of snow glowed blue in the moonlight. She'd go to Nehemia's 


room first--go there and lock Nehemia up safely, and then take down the 
bastard who was coming for her. 

Archer's men could go to hell. She'd dispatched them in a matter of 
heartbeats. Whoever had been sent to hurt Nehemia--that person was hers. 
Hers to take apart bit by bit, until she ended them. She would throw their 
remnants at the feet of the king. 

She flung open one of the glass doors. There were guards loitering about, 
but she'd picked this entrance because they knew her--and knew her face. 
She didn't expect to glimpse Dorian, though, chatting with them. His sapphire 
eyes were nothing more than a glimmer of color as she sprinted by. 

She could hear shouts from behind her, but she wouldn't stop, couldn't 
stop. Not again. Never again. 

She hit the stairs, taking them by twos and threes, her legs trembling. Just 
a bit farther--Nehemia's rooms were only one level up, and two hallways 
over. She was Adarlan's Assassin--she was Celaena Sardothien. She would 
not fail. The gods owed her. The Wyrd owed her. She would not fail 
Nehemia. Not when there were so many awful words left between them. 

Celaena hit the top of the stairs. The shouts behind her grew; people were 
calling her name. She would stop for no one. 

She turned down the familiar hallway, nearly sobbing with relief at the 
sight of the wooden door. It was shut; there were no signs of forced entry. 

She drew her two remaining daggers, summoning the words she'd need to 
quickly explain to Nehemia how and where to hide. When her assailant 
arrived, Nehemia's only task would be to keep quiet and concealed. Celaena 
would deal with the rest. And she'd enjoy the hell out of it. 

She reached the door and slammed into it, exploding through the locks. 

The world slowed to the beat of an ancient, ageless drum. 

Celaena beheld the room. 

The blood was everywhere. 

Before the bed, Nehemia's bodyguards lay with their throats cut from ear 
to ear, their internal organs spilling out onto the floor. 

And on the bed ... 

On the bed ... 

She could hear the shouts growing closer, reaching the room, but their 
words were somehow muffled, as though she were underwater, the sounds 
coming from the surface above. 


Celaena stood in the center of the freezing bedroom, gazing at the bed, and 
the princess's broken body atop it. 
Nehemia was dead. 


Chapter 30 


Celaena stared at the body. 

An empty body, artfully mutilated, so cut up that the bed was almost black 
with blood. 

People had rushed into the room behind her, and she smelled the faint tang 
as someone was sick nearby. 

But she just stayed there, letting the others fan out around her as they 
rushed to assess the three cooling bodies in the room. That ancient, ageless 
drum--her heartbeat--pulsed through her ears, drowning out any sound. 

Nehemia was gone. That vibrant, fierce, loving soul; the princess who had 
been called the Light of Eyllwe; the woman who had been a beacon of hope 
--yjust like that, as if she were no more than a wisp of candlelight, she was 
gone. 

When it had mattered most, Celaena hadn't been there. 

Nehemia was gone. 


Someone murmured her name, but didn't touch her. 

There was a gleam of sapphire eyes in front of her, blocking out her vision 
of the bed and the dismembered body atop it. Dorian. Prince Dorian. There 
were tears running down his face. She reached out a hand to touch them. They 
were oddly warm against her freezing, distant fingers. Her nails were dirty, 
bloody, cracked--so gruesome against the smooth white cheek of the prince. 

And then that voice from behind her said her name again. 

"Celaena." 

They had done this. 

Her bloody fingers slid down Dorian's face, to his neck. He just stared at 
her, suddenly still. 

"Celaena," that familiar voice said. A warning. 

They had done this. They had betrayed her. Betrayed Nehemia. They had 
taken her away. Her nails brushed Dorian's exposed throat. 

"Celaena," the voice said. 

Celaena slowly turned. 


Chaol stared at her, a hand on his sword. The sword she'd brought to the 
warehouse--the sword she'd left there. Archer had told her that Chaol had 
known they were going to do this. 

He had known. 

She shattered completely, and launched herself at him. 


Chaol had only enough time to release his sword as she lunged, swiping for 
his face with a hand. 

She slammed him into the wall, and stinging pain burst from the four lines 
she gouged across his cheek with her nails. 

She reached for the dagger at her waist, but he grasped her wrist. Blood 
slid down his check, down his neck. 

His guards shouted, rushing closer, but he hooked a foot behind hers, 
twisting as he shoved, and threw her to the ground. 

"Stay back," he ordered them, but it cost him. Pinned beneath him, she 
slammed a fist up beneath his jaw, so hard his teeth sang. 

And then she was snarling, snarling like some kind of wild animal as she 
snapped for his neck. He reared back, throwing her against the marble floor 
again. "Stop." 

But the Celaena he knew was gone. The girl he'd imagined as his wife, 
the girl he'd shared a bed with for the past week, was utterly gone. Her 
clothes and hands were caked with the blood of the men in the warehouse. 
She wedged a knee up, pounding it between his legs so hard he lost his grip 
on her, and then she was on top of him, dagger drawn, plunging down toward 
his chest-- 

He grabbed her wrist again, crushing it in his hand as the blade hovered 
over his heart. Her whole body trembled with effort, trying to shove it the 
remaining few inches. She reached for her other dagger, but he caught that 
wrist, too. 

"Stop." He gasped, winded from the blow she'd landed with her knee, 
trying to think past that blinding pain. "Celaena, stop." 

"Captain," one of his men ventured. 

"Stay back," he snarled again. 

Celaena threw her weight into the dagger she held aloft, and gained an 
inch. His arms strained. She was going to kill him. She was truly going to kill 


him. 

He made himself look into her eyes, look at the face so twisted with rage 
that he couldn't find her. 

"Celaena," he said, squeezing her wrists so hard that he hoped the pain 
registered somewhere--wherever she had gone. But she still wouldn't 
loosen her grip on the blade. "Celaena, I'm your friend." 

She stared at him, panting through gritted teeth, her breath coming quicker 
and quicker before she roared, the sound filling the room, his blood, his 
world: "You will never be my friend. You will always be my enemy." 

She bellowed the last word with such soul-deep hatred that he felt it like a 
punch to the gut. She surged again, and he lost his grip on the wrist that held 
the dagger. The blade plunged down. 

And stopped. There was a sudden chill in the room, and Celaena's hand 
just stopped, as though it had been frozen in midair. Her eyes left his face, 
but Chaol couldn't see who it was she hissed at. For a heartbeat, it seemed as 
if she was thrashing against some invisible force, but then Ress was behind 
her, and she was too busy struggling to notice as the guard slammed the 
pommel of his sword into her head. 

As Celaena fell atop him, a part of Chaol fell along with her. 


Chapter 31 


Dorian knew that Chaol had no choice, no other way out of the situation, as 
his friend carried Celaena out of that bloody chamber, into the servants' 
stairwell, and down, down, down, until they reached the castle dungeons. He 
tried not to look at Kaltain's curious, half-mad face as Chaol laid Celaena in 
the cell beside hers. As he locked the cell door. 

"Let me give her my cloak," Dorian said, reaching to unfasten it. 

"Don't," Chaol said quietly. His face was still bleeding. She'd gouged 
four lines across his cheek with her nails. Her nails. Gods above. 

"I don't trust her with anything in there except hay." Chaol had already 
taken the time to remove her remaining weapons--including six lethal- 
looking hairpins from her braid--and checked her boots and tunic for any 
hidden ones. 

Kaltain was smiling faintly at Celaena. "Don't touch her, don't talk to her, 
and don't look at her,' Chaol said, as if there wasn't a wall of bars 
separating the two women. Kaltain just huffed and curled up on her side. 
Chaol barked orders to the guards about food and water rations, and how 
often the watch was to be changed, and then stalked from the dungeon. 

Dorian silently followed. He didn't know where to begin. There was grief 
sweeping down on him in waves as he realized again and again that Nehemia 
was dead; there was the sickness and terror of what he'd seen in that 
bedroom; and there was the horror and relief that he'd somehow used his 
power to stop Celaena's hand before she stabbed Chaol, and that no one 
except Celaena had noticed. 

And when she'd hissed at him ... he'd seen something so savage in her 
eyes that he shuddered. 

They were halfway up the winding stone stairs out of the dungeons when 
Chaol suddenly slumped onto a step, putting his head in his hands. "What 
have I done?" Chaol whispered. 

And despite whatever was changing between them, he couldn't walk away 
from Chaol. Not tonight. Not when he, too, needed someone to sit next to. 
"Tell me what happened," Dorian said quietly, taking a seat on the stair 
beside him and staring into the gloom of the stairwell. 


So Chaol did. 

Dorian listened to his tale of kidnapping, of some rebel group trying to use 
him to get Celaena to trust them, of Celaena breaking into the warehouse and 
cutting down men like they were nothing. How the king had told Chaol of an 
anonymous threat to Nehemia a week ago and ordered him to keep an eye on 
Nehemia. How the king wanted the princess questioned and told Chaol to 
keep Celaena away tonight. And then Archer--the man she'd been 
dispatched to kill weeks ago--explaining that it had been code for Nehemia 
being assassinated. And then how Celaena ran from the slums all the way 
back here, to find that she'd been too late to save her friend. 

There were things Chaol still wasn't telling him, but Dorian understood it 
well enough. 

His friend was trembling--which was a horror in itself, another 
foundation slipping out from beneath their feet. "ve never seen anyone 
move like she did," Chaol breathed. "I've never seen anyone run that fast. 
Dorian, it was like ..." Chaol shook his head. "I found a horse within 
seconds of her taking off, and she still outran me. Who can do that?" 

Dorian might have dismissed it as a warped sense of time due to fear and 
grief, but he'd had magic coursing through his veins only moments ago. 

"I didn't know this would happen," Chaol said, resting his forehead 
against his knees. "If your father ..." 

"Tt wasn't my father," Dorian said. "I dined with my parents tonight." 
He'd just come from that dinner when Celaena went flying past, hell burning 
in her eyes. That look had been enough for him to run after her, guards in tow, 
until Chaol nearly collided with them in the halls. "My father said he was 
going to talk to Nehemia later on, after dinner. From what I saw, this 
happened hours before that." 

"But if your father didn't want her dead, who did? I had extra patrols on 
alert for any threat; I picked those men myself. Whoever did this got through 
them like they were nothing. Whoever did this ..." 

Dorian tried not to think of the murder scene. One of Chaol's guards had 
taken a look at the three bodies and vomited all over the floor. And Celaena 
had just stood there, staring at Nehemia, as if she'd been sucked out of 
herself. 

"Whoever did this got some kind of sick delight out of it," Chaol finished. 
The bodies flashed through Dorian's mind again: carefully, artfully arranged. 


"What does it mean, though?" It was easier to keep talking than to really 
consider what had happened. The way Celaena had looked at him without 
really seeing him, the way she'd wiped away his tears with a finger, then 
grazed her nails across his neck, as though she could sense the pulsing life's 
blood beneath. And when she'd launched herself at Chaol ... 

"How long will you keep her here?" Dorian said, looking down the stairs. 

She had attacked the Captain of the Guard in front of his men. Worse than 
attacked. 

"As long as it takes," Chaol said quietly. 

"For what?" 

"For her to decide not to kill us all." 


Celaena knew where she was before she awoke. And she didn't care. She 
was living the same story again and again. 

The night she'd been captured, she'd also snapped, and come so close to 
killing the person she most wanted to destroy before someone knocked her 
out and she awoke in a rotting dungeon. She smiled bitterly as she opened her 
eyes. It was always the same story, the same loss. 

A plate of bread and soft cheese, along with an iron cup of water, lay on 
the floor on the other side of the cell. Celaena sat up, her head throbbing, and 
felt the bump on the side of her skull. 

"I always knew you'd wind up here," Kaltain said from the cell beside 
hers. "Did Their Royal Highnesses tire of you, too?" 

Celaena pulled the tray closer, then leaned against the stone wall behind 
the pallet of hay. "I tired of them," she said. 

"Did you kill anyone particularly deserving?" 

Celaena snorted, closing her eyes against the pounding in her mind. 
"Almost." 

She could feel the stickiness of the blood on her hands and beneath her 
nails. Chaol's blood. She hoped the four scratches scarred. She hoped she 
would never see him again. If she did, she'd kill him. He'd known the king 
wanted to question Nehemia. He'd known that the king--the most brutal and 
murderous monster in the world--had wanted to question her friend. And he 
hadn't told her. Hadn't warned her. 


It wasn't the king, though. No--she had gathered enough in the few 
minutes she'd been in that bedroom to know this wasn't his handiwork. But 
Chaol had still been warned about the anonymous threat, had been aware that 
someone wanted to hurt Nehemia. And he hadn't told her. 

He was so stupidly honorable and loyal to the king that he didn't even 
think that she could have done something to prevent this. 

She had nothing left to give. After she'd lost Sam and been sent to 
Endovier, she'd pieced herself back together in the bleakness of the mines. 
And when she'd come here, she'd been foolish enough to think that Chaol had 
put the final piece into place. Foolish enough to think, just for a moment, that 
she could get away with being happy. 

But death was her curse and her gift, and death had been her good friend 
these long, long years. 

"They killed Nehemia," she whispered into the dark, needing someone, 
anyone, to hear that the once-bright soul had been extinguished. To know that 
Nehemia had been here, on this earth, and she had been all that was good and 
brave and wonderful. 

Kaltain was silent for a long moment. Then she said quietly, as if she were 
trading one piece of misery for another, "Duke Perrington is going to Morath 
in five days, and I am to go with him. The king told me I can either marry 
him, or rot down here for the rest of my life." 

Celaena turned her head, opening her eyes to find Kaltain sitting against 
the wall, grasping her knees. She was even dirtier and more haggard than 
she'd been a few weeks ago. She still clutched Celaena's cloak around her. 
Celaena said, "You betrayed the duke. Why would he want you for his wife?" 

Kaltain laughed quietly. "Who knows what games these people play, and 
what ends they have in mind?" She rubbed her dirty hands on her face. "My 
headaches are worse," she mumbled. "And those wings--they never stop." 

My dreams have been filled with shadows and wings, Nehemia had said; 
Kaltain, too. 

"What has one to do with the other?" Celaena demanded, the words sharp 
and hollow. 

Kaltain blinked, raising her brows as though she had no idea what she'd 
said. "How long will they keep you here?" she asked. 

For trying to kill the Captain of the Guard? Forever, perhaps. She 
wouldn't care. Let them execute her. 


Let them put an end to her, too. 

Nehemia had been the hope of a kingdom, of many kingdoms. The court 
Nehemia had dreamed of would never be. Eyllwe would never be free. 
Celaena would never get the chance to tell her that she was sorry for the 
things she'd said. All that would remain were the last words Nehemia had 
spoken to her. The last thing her friend had thought of her. 

You are nothing more than a coward. 

"Tf they let you out," Kaltain said, both of them staring into the blackness 
of their prisons, "make sure that they're punished someday. Every last one of 
them." 

Celaena listened to her own breathing, felt Chaol's blood under her nails, 
and the blood of all those men she'd hacked down, and the coldness of 
Nehemia's room, where all that gore had soaked the bed. 

"They will be," Celaena swore to the darkness. 

She had nothing left to give, except that. 

It would have been better if she'd stayed in Endovier. Better to have died 
there. 

Her body didn't feel quite like hers when she pulled the tray of food 
toward her, the metal scraping against the old, damp stones. She wasn't even 
hungry. 

"They drugged the water with a sedative,' Kaltain said as Celaena 
reached for the iron cup. "That's what they do for me, too." 

"Good," Celaena said, and drank the entire thing. 


Three days passed. And every meal they brought her was drugged with that 
sedative. 

Celaena stared into the abyss that now filled her dreams, both sleeping 
and awake. The forest on the other side was gone, and there was no stag; 
only barren terrain all around, crumbling rocks and a vicious wind that 
whispered the words again and again. 

You are nothing more than a coward. 

So Celaena drank the drugged water every time they offered it, and let it 
sweep her away. 


"She drank the water about an hour ago," Ress said to Chaol on the morning 
of the fourth day. 

Chaol nodded. She was unconscious on the floor, her face gaunt. "Has she 
been eating?" 

"A bite or two. She hasn't tried to escape. And she hasn't said one word 
to us, either." 

Chaol unlocked the cell door, and Ress and the other guards tensed. 

But he couldn't bear another moment without seeing her. Kaltain was 
asleep next door and didn't stir as he strode across Celaena's cell. 

He knelt by Celaena. She reeked of old blood, and her clothes were stiff 
with it. His throat tightened. 

In the castle above, it had been sheer pandemonium for the past several 
days. He had men combing the castle and city for Nehemia's assassin. He had 
gone before the king multiple times already to try to explain what happened: 
how he'd gotten himself kidnapped, and how, even with extra men watching 
Nehemia, someone had slipped past them all. He was stunned the king hadn't 
dismissed him--or worse. 

The worst part was that the king seemed smug. He hadn't had to dirty his 
hands to get rid of a problem. His main annoyance was dealing with the 
uproar that was sure to happen in Eyllwe. He hadn't spared one moment to 
mourn Nehemia, or shown one flicker of remorse. It had taken a surprising 
amount of self-control for Chaol not to throttle his own sovereign. 

But more than just his fate relied on his submission and good behavior. 
When Chaol had explained Celaena's situation to the king, he had barely 
looked surprised. He'd just said to get her in line, and left it at that. 

Get her in line. 

Chaol gently picked up Celaena, trying not to grunt at the weight, and 
carried her out of the cell. He'd never forgive himself for throwing her in this 
rotting dungeon, even though he hadn't had a choice. He hadn't even let 
himself sleep in his own bed--the bed that still smelled like her. He'd laid 
down on it that first night and realized what she was lying on, and opted for 
his couch instead. The least he could do right now was get her back to her 
own rooms. 

But he didn't know how to get her in line. He didn't know how to fix what 
had been broken. Both inside of her, and between them. 

His men flanked him as he brought her up to her rooms. 


Nehemia's death hung around him, followed his every step. It had been 
days since he'd dared look in the mirror. Even if it hadn't been the king who 
had ordered Nehemia dead, if Chaol had warned Celaena about the unknown 
threat, at least she would have been looking out. If he'd warned Nehemia, her 
men would have been on alert, too. Sometimes the reality of his decision hit 
him so hard he couldn't breathe. 

And then there was this reality, the reality he held in his arms as Ress 
opened the door to her rooms. Philippa was already waiting, beckoning him 
to the bathing chamber. He hadn't even thought of that--that Celaena might 
need to be cleaned up before getting into bed. 

He couldn't meet the servant's gaze as he walked into the bathing 
chamber, because he knew the truth he'd find there. 

He'd realized it the moment Celaena had turned to him in Nehemia's 
bedroom. 

He had lost her. 

And she would never, in a thousand lifetimes, let him in again. 


Chapter 32 


Celaena awoke in her own bed, and knew there would be no more sedatives 
in her water. 

There would be no more breakfast conversations with Nehemia, nor 
would there be any more lessons on the Wyrdmarks. There would be no more 
friends like her. 

She knew without looking that someone had scrubbed her clean. Blinking 
against the brightness of the sunlight in her room--her head instantly 
pounding after days in the darkness of the dungeon--she found Fleetfoot 
sleeping pressed against her. The dog lifted her head to lick Celaena's arm a 
few times before going back to sleep, her nose nestled between Celaena's 
elbow and torso. She wondered if Fleetfoot could sense the loss, too. She'd 
often wondered if Fleetfoot loved the princess more than her. 

You are nothing more than a coward. 

She couldn't blame Fleetfoot. Outside of this rotten, festering court and 
kingdom, the rest of the world had loved Nehemia. It was hard not to. 
Celaena had adored Nehemia from the moment she'd laid eyes on her, like 
they were twin souls who had at last found each other. A soul-friend. And 
now she was gone. 

Celaena put a hand against her chest. How absurd--how utterly absurd 
and useless--that her heart still beat and Nehemia's didn't. 

The Eye of Elena was warm, as if trying to offer some comfort. Celaena 
let her hand drop back to her mattress. 

She didn't even try to get out of bed that day, after Philippa coaxed her 
into eating and let slip that she'd missed Nehemia's funeral. She'd been too 
busy guzzling down sedatives and hiding from her grief in the dungeons to be 
present when they put her friend in the cold earth, so far from the sun- 
warmed soil of Eyllwe. 

You are nothing more than a coward. 

So Celaena didn't get out of bed that day. And she didn't get out of it the 
next. 

Or the next. 

Or the next. 





Chapter 33 


The mines in Calaculla were stifling, and the slave girl could only imagine 
how much worse they would become when the summer sun was overhead. 

She had been in the mines for six months--longer than anyone else had 
ever survived, she'd been told. Her mother, her grandmother, and her little 
brother hadn't lasted a month. Her father hadn't even made it to the mines 
before Adarlan's butchers had cut him down, along with the other known 
rebels in their village. Everyone else had been rounded up and sent here. 

She'd been alone for five and a half months now; alone, yet surrounded by 
thousands. She couldn't remember the last time she'd seen the sky, or the 
grasslands of Eyllwe undulating in a cool breeze. 

She would see them both again, though--the sky and the grasslands. She 
knew she would, because she'd stayed awake on nights she was supposed to 
have been sleeping, listening through the cracks in the floorboards as her 
father and his fellow rebels talked of ways to bring down Adarlan, and of 
Princess Nehemia, who was in the capital at that very moment, working for 
their freedom. 

If she could just hold on, if she could just keep drawing breath, she might 
make it until Nehemia accomplished her goal. She would make it, and then 
bury her dead; and when the mourning months were over, she would find the 
nearest rebel group and join them. With every Adarlanian life she took, she 
would say the names of her dead again, so that they would hear her in the 
afterlife and know they were not forgotten. 

She swung her pickax into the unforgiving wall of stone, her breath ragged 
in her parched throat. The overseer lounged against a nearby wall, sloshing 
water in his canteen, waiting for the moment when one of them would 
collapse, just so he could unfurl that whip of his. 

She kept her head down, kept working, kept breathing. 

She would make it. 

She didn't know how much time passed, but she felt the ripple go through 
the mines like a shudder in the earth. A ripple of stillness, followed by wails. 

She felt it coming, swelling up toward her, closer and closer with each 
turned head and murmured words. 


And then she heard it--the words that changed everything. 

Princess Nehemia is dead. Assassinated by Adarlan. 

The words were past her before she had time to swallow them. 

There was a scrape of leather against rock. The overseer would tolerate 
the pause for only a few seconds longer before he started swinging. 

Nehemia is dead. 

She stared down at the pickax in her hands. 

She turned, slowly, to look into the face of her overseer, the face of 
Adarlan. He cocked his wrist, pronged whip ready. 

She felt her tears before she realized they were falling, sliding through six 
months' worth of filth. 

Enough. The word screamed through her, so loudly she began to shake. 

Silently, she began to recite the names of her dead. And as the overseer 
raised his whip, she added her name to the end of that list and swung her ax 
into his gut. 


Chapter 34 


"Any changes in her behavior?" 

"She got out of bed." 

"And?" 

Standing in the sunlit hall of the upper levels of the glass castle, Ress's 
usually jovial face was grim. "And now she's sitting in a chair in front of the 
fire. It's the same as yesterday: she got out of bed, sat in the chair all day, 
then got back into bed at sundown." 

"Is she still not speaking?" 

Ress shook his head, keeping his voice low as a courtier passed by. 
"Philippa says she just sits there and stares at the fire. Won't speak. Still 
barely touches her food." Ress's eyes grew warier as they took in the healing 
cuts that ran down Chaol's cheek. Two had already scabbed and would fade, 
but there was a long, surprisingly deep one that was still tender. Chaol 
wondered whether it would scar. He'd deserve it if it did. 

"T'm probably overstepping my bounds--" 

"Then don't say it," Chaol growled. He knew exactly what Ress would 
say: the same thing Philippa said, and anyone who saw him and gave him that 
pitying glance. You should try talking to her. 

He didn't know how word had gotten out so quickly that she'd tried to kill 
him, but it seemed they all knew how deep the break between him and 
Celaena went. He'd thought the two of them had been discreet, and he knew 
Philippa wasn't a gossip. But perhaps what he felt for her had been written 
all over him. And what she now felt for him ... He resisted the urge to touch 
the cuts on his face. 

"I still want the watch posted outside her door and windows," he ordered 
Ress. He was on his way to another meeting; another shouting match about 
how they should deal with the fallout in Eyllwe over the princess's death. 
"Don't stop her if she leaves, but try to slow her down a bit." 

Long enough for word to get to him that she'd finally left her rooms. If 
anyone was going to intercept Celaena, if anyone would confront her about 
what happened to Nehemia, it would be him. Until then, he'd give her the 
space she needed, even if it killed him not to speak to her. She'd become 


entwined in his life--from the morning runs to the lunches to the kisses she 
stole from him when no one was looking--and now, without her, he felt 
hollow. But he still didn't know how he'd ever look her in the eye. 

You will always be my enemy. 

She'd meant it. 

Ress nodded. "Consider it done." 

The young guard saluted as Chaol headed for the meeting room. There 
would be other meetings today--lots of meetings, since the debate was still 
raging over how Adarlan should react to Nehemia's death. And though he 
hated to admit it, he had other things to worry about than Celaena's unending 
grief. 

The king had summoned his southern lords and retainers to Rifthold. 

Including Chaol's father. 


Dorian usually didn't mind Chaol's men. But he did mind being followed 
around, day and night, by guards who were on the lookout for any threat. 
Nehemia's death had proved that the castle was not impregnable. His mother 
and Hollin were sequestered in her chambers, and many of the nobility had 
either left the city or were lying low, too. 

Except Roland. Though Roland's mother had fled back to Meah the 
morning after the princess was assassinated, Roland stayed, insisting that 
Dorian would need his support now more than ever. And he was right. At the 
council meetings, which grew more and more crowded as the southern lords 
arrived, Roland backed every point and objection that Dorian made. 
Together they argued against sending more troops into Eyllwe in case of 
revolt, and Roland seconded Dorian's proposal that they should publicly 
apologize to Nehemia's parents for her death. 

His father had exploded when Dorian suggested that, but Dorian had still 
written her parents a message, expressing his deepest condolences. His 
father could go to hell for all he cared. 

And that was starting to be a problem, he realized as he sat in his tower 
room and flipped through all the documents he had to read before tomorrow's 
meeting with the southern lords. He had spent so long being careful to avoid 
defying his father, but what sort of man could he call himself if he blindly 
obeyed? 


A smart man, a part of him whispered, flickering with that cold, ancient 
power. 

At least his four guards stayed outside his rooms. His private tower was 
high enough that no one could reach the balcony, and only one stair led up 
and down. Easily defensible. But it also made for an easy cage. 

Dorian stared at the glass pen on his desk. The night Nehemia had died, he 
hadn't intended to stop Celaena's wrist in midair. He'd just known that the 
woman he'd loved was about to kill his oldest friend over a 
misunderstanding. He'd been too far away to grab her as she plunged the 
blade down, but then ... it was like a phantom arm reached out from within 
him and wrapped around her wrist. He could fee/ her blood-crusted skin, as 
if he himself were touching her. 

But he hadn't known what he was doing. He'd just acted on gut feeling 
and desperation and need. 

He had to learn to control this power, whatever it was. If he could control 
it, then he could keep it from appearing at inopportune times. Like when he 
was in those damned council meetings and his temper rose, and he felt the 
magic stirring in response. 

Dorian took a deep breath, focusing on the pen, willing it to move. He'd 
stopped Celaena midstrike, he'd thrown a wall of books into the air--he 
could move a pen. 

It didn't move. 

After staring at it until his eyes nearly crossed, Dorian groaned and leaned 
back in his chair, covering his eyes with his hands. 

Maybe he'd gone insane. Maybe he'd just imagined the whole thing. 

Nehemia had once promised to be there when he needed help--when 
some power in him awoke. She had known. 

Had her assassin, in killing Nehemia, also killed any hope he had of 
finding answers? 


Celaena had only started sitting in the chair because Philippa had come in 
yesterday and complained about the dirty sheets. She might have told 
Philippa to go to hell, but then she considered who had last shared this bed 
with her, and was suddenly glad to have them replaced. Any trace of him, she 
wanted gone. 


As the sun finished setting, she sat before the fire, staring into the glowing 
embers that grew brighter as the world darkened. 

Time was shifting and ebbing around her. Some days had passed in an 
hour, others a lifetime. She had bathed once, long enough to wash her hair, 
and Philippa had watched the whole time to make sure she didn't drown 
herself instead. 

Celaena ran a thumb over the armrest of the chair. She had no intention of 
ending her life. Not before she did what needed to be done. 

The shadows in the room grew, and the embers seemed to breathe as she 
watched them. Breathing with her, pulsing with each heartbeat. 

In these days of silence and sleep, she'd realized one thing: the assassin 
had come from outside the palace. 

Perhaps they had been hired by whoever had initially threatened 
Nehemia's life--perhaps not. But they weren't associated with the king. 

Celaena gripped the arms of the chair, her nails digging into the polished 
wood. It hadn't been one of Arobynn's assassins, either. She knew his style, 
and it wasn't this monstrous. She again went over the details of the bedroom, 
now branded into her mind. 

She did know one killer this monstrous. 

Grave. 

She'd learned as much about him as she could when she'd faced him in 
the competition to become King's Champion. She'd heard what he did to the 
bodies of his victims. 

Her lips pulled back from her teeth. 

Grave knew the palace; he'd trained here just as she had. And he'd 
known, too, just whom he was murdering and dismembering--and what it 
would mean to her. 

A familiar, dark fire rippled in her gut, spreading through her, dragging 
her down into an abyss without end. 

Celaena Sardothien stood from her chair. 


Chapter 35 


There would be no candles for these midnight deeds, no ivory horn to signal 
the start of this hunt. She dressed in her darkest tunic and slid a smooth black 
mask into her cloak pocket. All of her weapons, even the hairpins, had been 
removed from her rooms. She knew without checking that the doors and 
windows were being watched. Good. This was not the sort of hunt that began 
at the front door. 

Celaena locked her bedroom and spared a glance at Fleetfoot, who 
cowered under the bed as she hauled open the secret door. The dog was still 
quietly whining as Celaena strode into the passage. 

She didn't need a light to make her way down to the tomb. She knew the 
path by memory now, each step, each turn. 

Her cloak whispered against the steps. Down and down she went. 

It was war upon them all. Let them tremble in fear at what they had 
awoken. 

Moonlight spilled onto the landing, illuminating the open door of the tomb 
and Mort's little bronze face. 

"Pm sorry about your friend," he said with surprising sorrow as she 
stalked toward him. 

She didn't reply. And she didn't care how he knew. She just kept walking, 
through the door and between the sarcophagi, to the heap of treasure piled in 
the back. 

Daggers, hunting knives--she took whatever she could strap onto her belt 
or tuck into her boots. She took a handful of gold and jewels and shoved that 
into a pocket, too. 

"What are you doing?" Mort demanded from the hallway. 

Celaena approached the stand that displayed Damaris, sword of Gavin, 
first King of Adarlan. The hollowed-out golden pommel glinted in the 
moonlight as she pulled the scabbard from the stand and strapped it across 
her back. 

"That is a sacred sword," Mort hissed, as though he could see inside. 

Celaena smiled grimly as she stalked back to the door, flinging her hood 
over her head. 


"Wherever you are going," Mort went on, "whatever you plan to do, you 
debase that sword by taking it from here. Aren't you afraid of angering the 
gods?" 

Celaena just laughed quietly before she took the stairs, savoring each step, 
each movement that brought her closer to her prey. 


She relished the burn in her arms as she hauled the sewer grate up, rotating 
the ancient wheel until it was fully raised, dripping with filth, and the water 
beneath the castle flowed freely into the small river outside. She tossed a 
piece of broken stone into the river beyond the archway, listening for guards. 

Not a sound, not a scrape of armor or a whisper of warning. 

An assassin had killed Nehemia, an assassin with a taste for the grotesque 
and a desire for notoriety. Finding Grave would take only a few questions. 

She tied the chain around the lever, testing its strength, and checked to 
ensure that Damaris was tightly strapped to her back. Then, gripping the 
castle stones, she swung around the wall, slithering sideways. She didn't 
bother to glance up at the castle as she eased around the bank of the river and 
dropped onto the frozen ground. 

Then she vanished into the night. 


Cloaked in darkness, Celaena stalked through the streets of Rifthold. She 
made no sound as she passed through dim alleys. 

Only one place could provide the answers she wanted. 

Sewage and puddles of excrement lay beneath every window of the slums, 
and the cobblestone streets were cracked and misshapen after many hard 
winters. The buildings leaned against each other, some so ramshackle that 
even the poorest citizens had abandoned them. On most streets, the taverns 
overflowed with drunks and whores and everyone else who sought 
temporary relief from their miserable lives. 

It made no difference how many saw her. None would bother her tonight. 

The cape billowed behind her, her face remaining expressionless beneath 
her obsidian mask as she moved through the streets. The Vaults was just a 
few blocks away. 


Celaena's gloved hands clenched. Once she found out where Grave was 
hiding, she'd turn his skin inside out. Worse than that, actually. 

She stopped before a nondescript iron door in a quiet alley. Hired thugs 
stood watch outside; she flashed them the silver entrance fee, and they 
opened the door for her. In the subterranean warren below, one could find the 
cutthroats, the monsters, and the damned of Adarlan. The filth came here to 
exchange stories and make deals, and it was here that any whisper of 
Nehemia's assassin would be found. 

Grave had undoubtedly received a large fee for his services, and could be 
counted on to now be recklessly spending his blood money--a spree that 
would not go unnoticed. He wouldn't have left Rifthold--oh, no. He wanted 
people to know he killed the princess; he wanted to hear himself named the 
new Adarlan's Assassin. He wanted Celaena to know, too. 

As she headed down the steps into the Vaults, the reek of ale and 
unwashed bodies hit her like a stone to the face. She hadn't been in this sort 
of festering den for a long while. 

The main chamber was strategically lit: a chandelier hung in the center of 
the room, but there was little light to be found along the walls for those who 
sought not to be seen. All laughter halted as she strode between the tables. 
Red-rimmed eyes followed her every step. 

She didn't know the identity of the new crime lord who ruled over this 
place, and didn't care. Her business wasn't with him, not tonight. She didn't 
allow herself to look at the many fighting pits that occupied the distant end of 
the chamber--pits where crowds were still gathered, cheering for whoever 
fought with fists and feet within. 

She'd been to the Vaults before, many times in those final days before her 
capture. Now that Ioan Jayne and Rourke Farran were dead, the place 
seemed to have passed into new ownership without losing any of its 
depravity. 

Celaena walked right up to the barkeep. He didn't recognize her, but she 
didn't expect him to--not when she'd been so careful to hide her identity all 
those years. 

The barkeep was already pale, and his sparse hair had become even 
sparser over the past year and a half. He tried to peer beneath her cowl as 
she halted at the bar, but the mask and hood kept her features hidden. 


"Drink?" he asked, wiping sweat from his brow. Everyone in the bar was 
still watching her, either discreetly or outright. 

"No," she said, her voice contorted and deep beneath the mask. 

The barkeep gripped the edge of the counter. ""You--you're back," he said 
quietly, as more heads turned. "You escaped." 

So he did recognize her, then. She wondered if the new owners held a 
grudge against her for killing Ioan Jayne--and how many bodies she'd have 
to leave in her wake if they decided to start a fight right here, right now. What 
she planned to do tonight already broke enough rules, crossed too many lines. 

She leaned on the bar, crossing one ankle over the other. The barkeep 
mopped his brow again and poured her a brandy. "On the house," he said, 
sliding it to her. She caught it in her hand, but didn't drink it. He wet his lips, 
then asked, "How--how did you escape?" 

People leaned back in their chairs, straining to hear. Let them spread 
rumors. Let them hesitate before crossing her path. She hoped Arobynn 
heard, too. She hoped he heard and stayed the hell away from her. 

"You ll soon discover that," she said. "But I have need of you." 

His brows lifted. "Me?" 

"I have come to inquire after a man." Her voice was scratchy and hollow. 
"A man who recently earned a large sum of gold. For the assassination of the 
Eyllwe princess. He goes by the name of Grave. I need to know where he 
is." 

"T don't know anything." The barkeep's face turned even paler. 

She reached into a pocket and pulled out a glittering fistful of ancient 
jewels and gold. All eyes watched them now. 

"Allow me to repeat my question, barkeep." 


The assassin who called himself Grave ran. 

He didn't know how long she'd been hunting him. It had been well over a 
week since he'd killed the princess; a week, and no one had even looked his 
way. He thought he'd gotten away with it--and had even started wondering 
whether he should have been more creative with the body, if he should have 
left some sort of calling card behind. But all that had changed tonight. 

He'd been drinking at the counter of his favorite tavern when the packed 
room had suddenly gone quiet. He'd turned to see her in the doorway as she 


called out his name, looking more wraith than human. His name hadn't even 
finished echoing in the room before he burst into a sprint, escaping through 
the back exit and into the alley. He couldn't hear footsteps, but he knew she 
was behind him, melting in and out of shadows and mist. 

He took alleys and side streets, leaping over walls, zigzagging across the 
slums. Anything to shake her, to wear her down. He'd make his final stand in 
a quiet street. There, he would take out the blades strapped to his skin and 
make her pay for the way she'd humiliated him in the competition. The way 
she had sneered at him, the way she'd broken his nose and tossed her 
handkerchief onto his chest. 

Haughty, stupid bitch. 

He staggered as he rounded a corner, his breath ragged and raw. He had 
only three daggers hidden on him. He'd make them count, though. When she'd 
appeared at the tavern, he had immediately taken note of the broadsword 
hovering over one of her shoulders and the assortment of gleaming, wicked- 
looking blades strapped to her hips. But he could make her pay, even if he 
only had a few blades. 

Grave was halfway down the cobblestone alley when he realized it was a 
dead end, the far wall too high to climb. Here, then. He'd soon have her 
begging for mercy before he cut her into little, little pieces. Drawing one of 
his daggers, he smiled and turned to the open street behind him. 

Blue mist drifted by, and a rat scurried across the narrow passage. There 
was no noise, only the sounds of distant revelry. Perhaps he had lost her. 
Those royal fools had made the biggest mistake of their lives when they 
crowned her Champion. His client had said as much when he'd hired Grave. 

He waited a moment, still watching the open street entrance, and then 
allowed himself to breathe, surprised to find that he was a little 
disappointed. 

King's Champion indeed. It hadn't been hard to lose her at all. And now 
he would go home, and he'd receive another job offer in a matter of days. 
And then another. And another. His client had promised him that the offers 
would come. Arobynn Hamel would curse the day he had rejected Grave 
from the Assassins Guild for being too cruel with his prey. 

Grave chuckled, flipping his dagger in his hands. Then she appeared. 

She came through the fog, no more than a sliver of darkness. She didn't 
run--she just walked with that insufferable swagger. Grave surveyed the 


buildings surrounding them. The stone was too slippery, and there were no 
windows. 

One step at a time, she approached. He would really, really enjoy making 
her suffer as much as the princess had. 

Smiling, Grave retreated to the end of the alley, only stopping when his 
back hit the stone wall. In a narrower space, he could overpower her. And in 
this forgotten street, he could take his own sweet time doing what he wanted. 

Still she approached, and the sword at her back whined as she drew it. 
The moonlight glinted off the long blade. Probably a gift from her princeling 
lover. 

Grave pulled his second dagger from his boot. This wasn't a frilly, 
ridiculous competition run by nobility. Here, any rules applied. 

She didn't say anything when she neared. 

And Grave didn't say anything to her as he rushed at her, swiping for her 
head with both blades. 

She stepped aside, dodging him with maddening ease. Grave lunged 
again. But faster than he could follow she ducked and slashed her sword 
across his shins. 

He hit the wet ground before he felt the pain. The world flashed black and 
gray and red, and agony tore at him. A dagger still left in his hand, he scuttled 
backward toward the wall. But his legs wouldn't respond, and his arms 
strained to pull him through the damp filth. 

"Bitch," he hissed. "Bitch." He hit the wall, blood pouring from his legs. 
Bone had been sliced. He would not be able to walk. He could still find a 
way to make her pay, though. 

She stopped a few feet away and sheathed her sword. She drew a long, 
jeweled dagger. 

He swore at her, the filthiest word he could think of. 

She chuckled, and faster than a striking asp, she had one of his arms 
against the wall, the dagger glinting. 

Pain ripped through his right wrist, then his left as it, too, was slammed 
into the stone. Grave screamed--truly screamed--as he found his arms 
pinned to the wall by two daggers. 

His blood was nearly black in the moonlight. He thrashed, cursing her 
again and again. He would bleed to death unless he pulled his arms from the 
wall. 


With otherworldly silence, she crouched before him and lifted his chin 
with another dagger. Grave panted as she brought her face close to his. There 
was nothing beneath the cowl--nothing of this world. She had no face. 

"Who hired you?" she asked, her voice like gravel. 

"To do what?" he asked, almost sobbing. Maybe he could feign 
innocence. He could talk his way out, convince this arrogant whore he had 
nothing to do withit ... 

She turned the dagger, pressing it into his neck. "To kill Princess 
Nehemia." 

"N-n-no one. I don't know what you' re talking about." 

And then, without even an intake of breath, she buried another dagger he 
hadn't realized she'd been holding into his thigh. So deep he felt the 
reverberation as it hit the cobblestones beneath. His scream shattered out of 
him, and Grave writhed, his wrists rising farther on the blades. 

"Who hired you?" she asked again. Calm, so calm. 

"Gold," Grave moaned. "I have gold." 

She drew yet another dagger and shoved it into his other thigh, piercing 
again to the stone. Grave shrieked--shrieked to gods who did not save him. 
"Who hired you?" 

"I don't know what you' re talking about!" 

After a heartbeat, she withdrew the daggers from his thighs. He almost 
soiled himself at the pain, at the relief. 

"Thank you." He wept, even as he thought of how he would punish her. 
She sat back on her heels and stared at him. "Thank you." 

But then she brought up another dagger, its edge serrated and glinting, and 
hovered it close to his hand. 

"Pick a finger," she said. He trembled and shook his head. "Pick a 
finger." 

"P-please." A wet warmth filled the seat of his pants. 

"Thumb it is." 

"N-no. I... P1 tell you everything!" Still, she brought the blade closer, 
until it rested against the base of his thumb. "Don t! P11 tell you everything!" 


Chapter 36 


Dorian was just starting to feel his temper fray after hours of debate when the 
doors to his father's council room were thrown open and Celaena prowled 
in, her dark cape billowing behind her. All twenty men at the table fell silent, 
including his father, whose eyes went straight to the thing dangling from 
Celaena's hand. Chaol was already striding across the room from his post by 
the door. But he, too, stopped when he beheld the object she carried. 

A head. 

The man's face was still set in a scream, and there was something vaguely 
familiar about the grotesque features and mousy brown hair that she gripped. 
It was hard to be certain as it swung from her gloved fingers. 

Chaol put a hand on his sword, his face pale as death. The other guards in 
the room drew their blades, but didn't move--wouldn't move, until Chaol or 
the king commanded them. 

"What is this?" the king demanded. The councilmen and assembled lords 
were gaping. 

But Celaena was smiling as her eyes locked onto one of the ministers at 
the table, and she walked right toward him. 

And no one, not even Dorian's father, said anything as she set the severed 
head atop the minister's stack of papers. 

"I believe this belongs to you," she said, releasing her grip on the hair. 
The head lolled to the side with a thud. Then she patted--patted--the 
minister's shoulder before rounding the table and plopping into an empty 
chair at one end, sprawling across it. 

"Explain yourself," the king growled at her. 

She crossed her arms, smiling at the minister, whose face had turned green 
as he stared at the head before him. 

"I had a little chat with Grave about Princess Nehemia last night," she 
said. Grave, the assassin from the competition--and Minister Mullison's 
champion. "He sends his regards, minister. He also sends this." She tossed 
something onto the long table: a small golden bracelet, engraved with lotus 
blossoms. Something Nehemia would have worn. "Here's a lesson for you, 
Minister, from one professional to another: cover your tracks. And hire 


assassins without personal connections to you. And perhaps try not to do it 
so soon after you' ve publicly argued with your target." 

Mullison was looking at the king with pleading eyes. "I didn't do this." 
He recoiled from the severed head. "I have no idea what she's talking about. 
I'd never do something like this." 

"That's not what Grave said," Celaena crooned. Dorian could only stare 
at her. This was different from the feral creature she'd become the night 
Nehemia had died. What she was right now, the edge on which she was 
balancing ... Wyrd help them all. 

But then Chaol was at her chair, grasping her elbow. "What the hell do 
you think you're doing?" 

Celaena looked up at him and smiled sweetly. "Your job, apparently." She 
shook off his grip with a thrash, then got out of her seat, stalking around the 
table. She pulled a piece of paper out of her tunic and tossed it in front of the 
king. The impertinence in that throw should have earned her a trip to the 
gallows, but the king said nothing. 

Following her around the table, a hand still on his sword, Chaol watched 
her with a face like stone. Dorian began praying they wouldn't come to 
blows--not here, not again. If it riled his magic and his father saw ... Dorian 
wouldn't even think of that power when he was in a room with so many 
potential enemies. He was sitting beside the person who would give the 
order to have him put down. 

His father took the paper. From where he sat, Dorian could see that it was 
a list of names, at least fifteen long. 

"Before the unfortunate death of the princess," she said, "I took it upon 
myself to eliminate some traitors to the crown. My target," she said, and he 
knew his father was aware she meant Archer, "led me right to them." 

Dorian couldn't look at her for a moment longer. This couldn't be the 
whole truth. But she hadn't gone after them to hunt them down, she'd gone to 
save Chaol. So why lie now? Why pretend she'd been hunting them? What 
sort of game was she playing? 

Dorian looked across the table. Minister Mullison was still trembling at 
the severed head in front of him. He wouldn't have been surprised if the 
minister vomited right there. He was the one who had made the anonymous 
threat against Nehemia's life? 





After a moment, his father looked up from the list and surveyed her. "Well 
done, Champion. Well done indeed." 

Then Celaena and the King of Adarlan smiled at each other, and it was the 
most terrifying thing Dorian had ever seen. 

"Tell my exchequer to give you double last month's payment," the king 
said. Dorian felt his gorge rise--not just for the severed head and her blood- 
stiffened clothing, but also for the fact that he could not, for the life of him, 
find the girl he had loved anywhere in her face. And from Chaol's 
expression, he knew his friend felt the same. 

Celaena bowed dramatically to the king, flourishing a hand before her. 
Then, with a smile devoid of any warmth, she stared down Chaol before 
stalking from the room, her dark cape sweeping behind her. 

Silence. 

And then Dorian's attention returned to Minister Mullison, who merely 
whispered, "Please," before the king ordered Chaol to have him dragged to 
the dungeons. 


Celaena wasn't done--not nearly. Perhaps the bloodletting was over, but she 
still had another person to visit before she could return to her bedroom and 
wash off the stink of Grave's blood. 

Archer was resting when she arrived at his townhouse, and his butler 
didn't dare stop her as she strode up the carpeted front steps, stormed down 
the elegant wood-paneled hallway, and flung open the double doors to what 
could only have been his room. 

Archer jolted in bed, wincing as he put a hand to his bandaged shoulder. 
Then he took in her appearance, the daggers still strapped to her waist. He 
went very, very still. 

"Tm sorry," he said. 

She stood at the foot of his bed, staring down at him, at his wan face and 
injured shoulder. "You're sorry, Chaol's sorry, the whole damn world is 
sorry. Tell me what you and your movement want. Tell me what you know 
about the king's plans." 

"I didn't want to lie to you," Archer said gently. "But I needed to know 
that I could trust you before I told you the truth. Nehemia'"--she tried not to 


wince at the name--"said you could be trusted, but I needed to know for 
sure. And I needed you to trust me, too." 

"So you thought kidnapping Chaol would make me trust you?" 

"We kidnapped him because we thought he and the king were planning to 
hurt her. I needed you to come to that warehouse and hear from Westfall's 
lips that he was aware there had been threats to her safety and he didn't tell 
you; to realize that he is the enemy. If Pd known you would go so berserk, I 
never would have done it." 

She shook her head. "That list you sent me yesterday, of the men from the 
warehouse--they' re truly dead?" 

"You killed them, yes." 

Guilt punched through her. "For my part, I am sorry." And she was. She'd 
memorized their names, tried to recall their faces. She would carry the 
weight of their deaths forever. Even Grave's death, what she'd done to him in 
that alley; she'd never forget that, either. "I gave their names to the king. It 
should keep him from looking in your direction for a little while longer--tfive 
days at most." 

Archer nodded, sinking back into the pillows. 

"Nehemia really worked with you?" 

"It was why she came to Rifthold--to see what could be done about 
organizing a force in the north. To give us information directly from the 
castle." As Celaena had always suspected. "Her loss ..." He closed his eyes. 
"We can't replace her." 

Celaena swallowed. 

"But you could," Archer said, looking at her again. "I know you came 
from Terrasen. So part of you has to realize that Terrasen must be free." 

You are nothing more than a coward. 

She kept her face blank. 

"Be our eyes and ears in the castle," Archer whispered. "Help us. Help 
us, and we can find a way to save everyone--to save you. We don't know 
what the king plans to do, only that he somehow found a source of power 
outside magic, and that he's probably using that power to create 
monstrosities of his own. But to what end, we don't know. That's what 
Nehemia was trying to discover--and it's knowledge that could save us all." 

She would digest all that later--much later. For now, she stared at Archer, 
then looked down at her blood-stiffened clothing. "I found the man who 


killed Nehemia." 

Archer's eyes widened. "And?" 

She turned to walk out of the room. "And the debt has been paid. Minister 
Mullison hired him to get rid of a thorn in his side--because she put him 
down one too many times in council meetings. The minister is now in the 
dungeons, awaiting his trial." 

And she would be there for every minute of that trial, and the execution 
afterward. 

Archer loosed a sigh as she put her hand on the doorknob. 

She looked over her shoulder at him, at the fear and sadness on his face. 
"You took an arrow for me," she said quietly, gazing at the bandages. 

"Tt was the least I could do after I caused that whole mess." 

She chewed on her lip and opened the door. "We have five days until the 
king expects you to be dead. Prepare yourself and your allies." 

"But--" 

"But nothing," she interrupted. "Consider yourself fortunate that I'm not 
going to rip out your throat for the stunt you pulled. Arrow or no arrow, and 
regardless of my relationship with Chaol, you lied to me. And kidnapped my 
friend. If it hadn't been for that--for you--I would have been at the castle 
that night." She fixed him with a stare. "I'm done with you. I don't want your 
information, I'm not going to give you information, and I don't particularly 
care what happens to you once you leave this city, as long as I never see you 
again." 

She took a step into the hallway. 

"Celaena?" 

She looked over her shoulder. 

"T am sorry. I know how much you meant to her--and she to you." 

The weight she'd been avoiding since she'd gone to hunt Grave suddenly 
fell on her, and her shoulders drooped. She was so tired. Now that Grave 
was dead, now that Minister Mullison was in the dungeon, now that she had 
no one left to maim and punish--she was so, so tired. 

"Five days; Pll be back in five days. If you aren't prepared to leave 
Rifthold, then I won't bother faking your death. P11 kill you before you know 
I'm in the room." 


Chaol kept his face blank and his shoulders thrown back as his father 
surveyed him. The small breakfast room in his father's suite was sunny and 
silent; pleasant, even, but Chaol remained in the doorway as he looked at his 
father for the first time in ten years. 

The Lord of Anielle looked mostly the same, his hair a bit grayer, but his 
face still ruggedly handsome, far too similar to Chaol's for his own liking. 

"The breakfast is growing cold," his father said, waving a broad hand to 
the table and the empty chair across from him. His first words. 

Chaol clenched his jaw so hard it hurt as he walked across the bright 
room and slid into the chair. His father poured himself a glass of juice and 
said without looking at him, "At least you fill out your uniform. Thanks to 
your mother's blood, your brother is all gangly limbs and awkward angles." 

Chaol bristled at the way his father spat "your mother's blood," but made 
himself pour a cup of tea, then butter a slice of bread. 

"Are you just going to keep quiet, or are you going to say something?" 

"What could I possibly have to say to you?" 

His father gave him a thin smile. "A polite son would inquire after the 
state of his family." 

"I haven't been your son for ten years. I don't see why I should start acting 
like one now." 

His father's eyes flicked to the sword at Chaol's side, examining, judging, 
weighing. Chaol reined in the urge to walk out. It had been a mistake to 
accept his father's invitation. He should have burned the note he received 
last night. But after he'd ensured that Minister Mullison was locked up, the 
king's lecture about Celaena making a fool out of him and his guards had 
somehow worn through his better judgment. 

And Celaena ... He had no idea how she'd gotten out of her rooms. None. 
The guards had been alert and had reported no noise. The windows hadn't 
been opened, and neither had her front door. And when he asked Philippa, 
she only said that the bedroom door had been locked all mght. 

Celaena was keeping secrets again. She'd lied to the king about the men 
she'd killed in the warehouse to rescue him. And there were other mysteries 
lurking around her, mysteries that he'd better start figuring out if he was to 
stand a chance of surviving her wrath. What his men had reported about the 
body that had been found in that alley ... 

"Tell me what you' ve been up to." 


"What do you wish to know?" Chaol said flatly, not touching his food or 
drink. 

His father leaned back in his seat--a movement that had once made Chaol 
start sweating. It usually meant that his father was about to focus all of his 
attention on him, that he would judge and consider and dole out punishment 
for any weakness, any missteps. But Chaol was a grown man now, and he 
answered only to his king. 

"Are you enjoying the position you sacrificed your lineage to attain?" 

"Yes." 

"I suppose I have you to thank for being dragged to Rifthold. And if 
Eyllwe rises up, then I suppose we can all thank you as well." 

It took every ounce of will he had, but Chaol just took a bite from his 
bread and stared at his father. 

Something like approval flickered in the man's eyes, and he took a bite of 
his own bread before he said, "Do you have a woman, at least?" 

The effort it took to keep his face blank was considerable. "No." 

His father smiled slowly. "You were always a horrible liar." 

Chaol looked toward the window, toward the cloudless day that was 
revealing the first hint of spring. 

"For your sake, I hope she's at least of noble blood." 

"For my sake?" 

"You might have spat on your lineage, but you are still a Westfall--and 
we do not marry scullery maids." 

Chaol snorted, shaking his head. "P11 marry whomever I please, whether 
she's a scullery maid or a princess or a slave. And it'll be none of your damn 
business." 

His father folded his hands in front of him. After a long silence, he said 
quietly, "Your mother misses you. She wants you home." 

The breath was knocked out of him. But he kept his face blank, his tone 
steady, as he said, "And do you, Father?" 

His father stared right at him--through him. "If Eyllwe rises up in 
retaliation, if we find ourselves facing a war, then Anielle will need a strong 
heir." 

"If yov' ve groomed Terrin to be your heir, then Pm sure he'll do just 
fine." 


"Terrin is a scholar, not a warrior. He was born that way. If Eyllwe 
rebels, there is a good chance that the wild men in the Fangs will rise up, too. 
Anielle will be the first place they sack. They've been dreaming of revenge 
for too long." 

Chaol wondered just how much this was grating on his father's pride, and 
part of him truly wanted to make him suffer for it. 

But he'd had enough of suffering, and enough of hatred. And he hardly had 
any fight left in him now that Celaena had made it clear she'd sooner eat hot 
coals than look at him with affection in her eyes. Now that Celeana was-- 
gone. So he just said, "My position is here. My life is here." 

"Your people need you. They will need you. Would you be so selfish as to 
turn your back on them?" 

"The way my father turned his back on me?" 

His father smiled again, a cruel, cold thing. "You disgraced your family 
when you gave up your title. You disgraced me. But you have made yourself 
useful these years--made the Crown Prince rely upon you. And when Dorian 
is king, he'll reward you for it, won't he? He could make Anielle a duchy 
and bless you with lands large enough to rival Perrington's territory around 
Morath." 

"What is it that you really want, Father? To protect your people, or to use 
my friendship with Dorian to your gain?" 

"Would you throw me in the dungeons if I said both? I hear you like to do 
that to the people who dare provoke you these days." And then there was that 
gleam in his eyes that told Chaol just how much his father already knew. 
"Perhaps if you do, your woman and I can exchange notes about the 
conditions." 

"If you want me back in Anielle, you're not doing a very good job of 
convincing me." 

"Do I need to convince you? You failed to protect the princess, and that 
has created the possibility of war. The assassin who was warming your bed 
now wants nothing more than to spill your innards on the ground. What's left 
for you here, except more shame?" 

Chaol slammed his hands on the table, rattling the dishes. "Enough." 

He didn't want his father knowing anything about Celaena, or about the 
remaining fragments of his heart. He wouldn't let his servants change the 


sheets on his bed because they still smelled like her, because he went to 
sleep dreaming that she was still lying beside him. 

"I have worked for ten years to be in this position, and it'll take far more 
than a few taunts from you to get me back to Anielle. And if you think Terrin 
is weak, then send him to me for training. Maybe here he'll learn how real 
men act." 

Chaol shoved his chair away from the table, rattling the dishes again, and 
stormed to the door. Five minutes. He'd lasted less than five minutes. 

He paused in the doorway and looked back at his father. The man was 
smiling faintly at him, still taking him in, still assessing how useful he would 
be. "You talk to her--you so much as look in her direction," Chaol warned, 
"and, father or not, P11 make you wish yov' d never set foot in this castle." 

And though he didn't wait to hear what his father had to say, Chaol left 
with the sinking feeling that he'd somehow just stepped right into his father's 
snare. 





Chapter 37 


There was no one else to carry out this task, not with Eyllwe soldiers and 
ambassadors still on their way to retrieve Nehemia's body from where it lay 
interred in the royal plot. As Celaena opened the door to the room that had 
smelled of blood and pain, she saw that someone had cleaned away all traces 
of gore. The mattress was gone, and Celaena paused in the doorway as she 
surveyed the skeleton of the bed frame. Perhaps it would be best to leave 
Nehemia's belongings to the people who came to bring her back to Eyllwe. 

But would they be friends of hers? The thought of strangers touching 
Nehemia's belongings, packing them away like any other objects, made her 
wild with grief and rage. 

Almost as wild as she'd been earlier today, when she'd walked into her 
own dressing room and ripped every gown off its hanger, pulled out every 
pair of shoes, every tunic, every ribbon and cloak and thrown them into the 
hallway. 

She'd burned the dresses that reminded her most of Nehemia, the dresses 
she'd worn at their lessons, at their meals, and on their walks around the 
castle. It was only when Philippa came in to scold her about the smoke that 
Celaena had relented, allowing her to take whatever clothing survived and 
donate it. But it had been too late to stop Celaena from burning the dress 
she'd worn the night of Chaol's birthday. That gown had burned first. 

And when her dressing room was empty, she shoved a bag of gold into 
Philippa's hands and told her to go buy some new clothes. Philippa had only 
given her a sad look--another thing that made Celaena sick--and left. 

It took Celaena an hour to gently, carefully pack up Nehemia's clothes and 
jewelry, and she tried not to dwell too long on the memories that 
accompanied each item. Or the lotus-blossom smell that clung to everything. 

When she had sealed all the trunks, she went to Nehemia's desk, which 
was still littered with papers and books as if the princess had only stepped 
outside for a moment. As she reached for the first paper, her eyes fell upon 
the arc of scars around her right hand--the teeth marks of the ridderak. 

The papers were covered with scribblings in Eyllwe and--and 
Wyrdmarks. 


Countless Wyrdmarks, some in long lines, some forming symbols like the 
ones Nehemia had traced underneath Celaena's bed all those months ago. 
How had the king's spies not taken these? Or had he not even bothered to 
have her rooms searched? She started stacking them into a pile. Perhaps she 
could still learn some things about the marks, even if Nehemia were-- 

Dead, she made herself think. Nehemia is dead. 

Celaena looked at the scars on her hand again and was about to turn from 
the desk when she spotted a familiar-looking book half tucked beneath some 
papers. 

It was the book from Davis's office. 

This copy was older, more damaged, but it was the same book. And 
written on the inside cover was a sentence in Wyrdmarks--such basic marks 
that even Celaena could understand them. 


Do not trust-- 


The final symbol, though, was a mystery. It looked like a wyvern--the 
Royal Seal. Of course she shouldn't trust the King of Adarlan. 

She flipped through the book, scanning it for any information. Nothing. 

And then she turned to the back cover. And there, Nehemia had written-- 


It is only with the eye that one can see rightly. 


It was scribbled in the common tongue, then in Eyllwe, then in some other 
languages that Celaena didn't recognize. Different translations--as if 
Nehemia had wondered whether the riddle held any meaning in another 
tongue. The same book, the same riddle, the same writing in the back. 

An idle lords nonsense, Nehemia had said. 

But Nehemia ... Nehemia and Archer led the group to which Davis had 
belonged. Nehemia had known Davis; known him and /ied about it, lied 
about the riddle, and-- 

Nehemia had promised. Promised that there would be no more secrets 
between them. 

Promised and lied. Promised and deceived her. 


She fought down a scream as she tore through every other piece of paper 
on the desk, in the room. Nothing. 

What else had Nehemia lied about? 

It is only with the eye ... 

Celaena touched her necklace. Nehemia had known about the tomb. If she 
had been feeding information to this group, and had encouraged Celaena to 
look into the eye carved into the wall ... then Nehemia had been looking, too. 
But after the duel, she'd returned the Eye of Elena to Celaena; if Nehemia 
had needed it, she would have kept it. And Archer hadn't mentioned knowing 
anything about this. 

Unless this wasn't the eye the riddle referenced. 

Because ... 

"By the Wyrd," Celaena breathed, and rushed out of the room. 


Mort hissed when she appeared at the door to the tomb. "Plan on desecrating 
any other sacred objects tonight?" 

Carrying a satchel full of papers and books that she'd grabbed from her 
rooms, Celaena merely patted his head as she walked by. His bronze teeth 
clanked against each other as he sought to bite her. 

The tomb was filled with moonlight bright enough to see by. And there, 
directly across the tomb from the eye in the wall, was another eye, golden 
and gleaming. 

Damaris. It was Damaris, the Sword of Truth. Gavin could see nothing but 
what was right-- 

It is only with the eye that one can see rightly. 

"Am I so blind?" Celaena dumped her leather satchel on the floor, the 
books and papers spilling across the stones. 

"It appears so!" Mort sang. The eye-shaped pommel was the exact size ... 

Celaena lifted the sword from its stand and unsheathed it. The Wyrdmarks 
on the blade seemed to ripple. She rushed back to the wall. 

"In case you didn't realize," called Mort, "you're supposed to hold the 
eye against the hole in the wall and look through it." 

"I know that," snapped Celaena. 

And so, not daring to breathe the entire time, Celaena lifted the pommel to 
the hole until both eyes were evenly aligned. She stood on her toes and 


peered in--and groaned. 

It was a poem. 

A lengthy poem. 

Celaena fished out the parchment and charcoal she'd stashed in her pocket 
and copied down the words, darting to and from the wall as she read, 
memorized, double-checked, and then recorded. It was only when she had 
finished the last stanza that she read it aloud. 


By the Valg, three were made, 
Of the Gate-Stone of the Wyrd: 
Obsidian the gods forbade 
And stone they greatly feared. 


In grief, he hid one in the crown 

Of her he loved so well, 

To keep with her where she lay down 
Inside the starry cell. 


The second one was hidden 
In a mountain made of fire, 
Where all men were forbidden 
Despite their great desires. 


Where the third lies 
Will never be told 
By voice or tongue 
Or sum of gold. 


Celaena shook her head. More nonsense. And the rhyme with "Wyrd" and 
"feared" was off. Not to mention the break in the rhyme scheme in the final 
lines. 

"Since you clearly knew that the sword could be used to read the riddle," 
she said to Mort, "then why don't you save me some trouble and tell me what 
the hell this one's about?" 


Mort sniffed. "It sounds to me like it's a riddle giving the location of three 
very powerful items." 

She read through the poem again. "But three what? Sounds like the second 
thing is hidden in--in a volcano? And the first and third ones ..." She gritted 
her teeth. "'Gate-Stone of the Wyrd' ... What is this a riddle for? And why is 
it here?" 

"Isn't that the question of the millennia!" Mort crowed as Celaena walked 
back to the papers and books she'd scattered at the other end of the tomb. 
"You'd better clean up the mess you brought down here, or P1 ask the gods 
to send some wicked beastie after you." 

"Already happened; Cain beat you to it months ago." She replaced 
Damaris in its stand. "Too bad the ridderak didn't take you off the door when 
he burst through." A thought hit her, and she stared at the wall in front of her 
--where she'd once fallen to avoid being ripped apart. "Who was it that 
moved the carcass of the ridderak?" 

"Princess Nehemia, of course." 

Celaena twisted to look toward the doorway. "Nehemia?" 

Mort made a choking sound and cursed his loose tongue. 

"Nehemia was--Nehemia was here? But I only brought her to the tomb 
... Mort's bronze face gleamed in the light of the candle she'd set before the 
door. "You're telling me that Nehemia came here after the ridderak attacked? 
That she knew about this place all along? And you're only telling me now?" 

Mort closed his eyes. "Not my business." 

Another deceit. Another mystery. 

"I suppose if Cain could get down here, then there are other entrances," 
she said. 

"Don't ask me where they are," Mort said, reading her mind. "I've never 
left this door." She had a feeling it was another lie; he always seemed to 
know about the layout of the tomb and when she was touching things she 
shouldn't be. 

"Then what use are you? Brannon just made you to piss everyone off?" 

"He did have a sense of humor like that." 

The thought of Mort actually having known the ancient Fae king made her 
quake inside. "I thought you had powers. You can't just speak some nonsense 
words and have the meaning of the riddle be revealed to me?" 

"Of course not. And isn't the journey more important than the end?" 


"No," she spat. Spewing a concoction of curses that could have curdled 
milk, Celaena tucked the paper into her pocket. She would need to study this 
riddle at length. 

If these items were things that Nehemia was looking for, things that she'd 
lied about to keep secret ... Celaena might be able to accept that Archer and 
his friends were capable of good, but she certainly didn't trust them to hold 
an object with the power that the riddle mentioned. If they were already 
looking, then perhaps it was in her best interest to find the items before 
anyone else. Nehemia hadn't figured out that the eye riddle referred to 
Damaris, but had she known what the three objects were? Maybe she'd 
pursued the eye riddle because she was trying to find the objects before the 
king did. 

The king's plans--had they been to find these things? 

She picked up her candle and strode from the room. 

"Has the questing spirit seized you at last?" 

"Not yet," she said as she walked by. Once she found out what the three 
items were, then maybe she'd consider finding a way to go after them. Even 
if the only volcanoes she knew about were in the Desert Peninsula, and there 
was no way in hell the king would let her go off on her own for such a long 
trip. 

"It?s a pity that I'm attached to this door," sighed Mort. "Imagine all the 
trouble you'll get into while trying to solve the riddle!" 

He was right; and as Celaena walked up the winding stair, she found 
herself wishing that he actually could move about. Then she'd at least have 
one person to discuss this with. If she did have to go hunt these things down, 
whatever they were, then she'd have no one to go with her. There was no one 
who knew the truth. 

The truth. 

She snorted. What truth was there now? That she had no one left to talk 
to? That Nehemia had lied through her teeth about so many things? That the 
king might be searching for an earth-shattering source of power? That he 
might already have something like this? Archer had mentioned a source of 
power outside of magic; was that what these things were? Nehemia had to 
have known... 

Celaena slowed, the candle guttering in a damp breeze through the 
stairwell, and slumped onto a step, bracing her arms on her knees. 


"What else were you hiding, Nehemia?" she whispered into the darkness. 

Celaena didn't need to turn to know who sat behind her when something 
silver and glimmering shone in the corner of her eye. 

"I thought you were too exhausted to come here," she said to the first 
Queen of Adarlan. 

"I can only stay for a few moments," Elena said, her dress rustling as she 
took a seat a few steps up from Celaena. It seemed a distinctly un-queenlike 
thing to do. 

Together, they stared into the gloom of the stairwell, Celaena's breathing 
the only sound. She supposed Elena didn't need to breathe--didn't make any 
sounds unless she wanted to. 

Celaena gripped her knees. "What was it like?" she asked quietly. 

"Painless," Elena said with equal quiet. "Painless, and easy." 

"Were you frightened?" 

"T was a very old woman, surrounded by my children, and their children, 
and their children's children. I had nothing to be afraid of when the time 
came." 

"Where did you go?" 

A soft laugh. "You know I can't tell you that." 

Celaena's lips wobbled. "She didn't die an old woman in her bed." 

"No, she didn't. But when her spirit left her body, there was no more pain 
--no more fear. She is safe now." 

Celaena nodded. Elena's dress rustled again, and then she was on the step 
beside her, an arm around her shoulders. She hadn't realized how cold she 
was until she found herself leaning into Elena's warmth. 

The queen didn't say anything as Celaena buried her face in her hands and 
wept at last. 


There was one last thing she had to do. Perhaps the hardest and the worst of 
all the things she had done since Nehemia had died. 

The moon was overhead, casting the world in silver. Even though they 
didn't recognize her in her current attire, the night watch at the royal 
mausoleum hadn't stopped her as she passed through the iron gates at the 
back of one of the castle gardens. Nehemia wouldn't be entombed inside the 
white marble building, though; inside was for the royal family. 


Celaena walked around the domed building, feeling as if the wyverns 
carved into the side stared at her as she passed. 

The few people still active at this hour had quickly looked away as she 
made her way here. She didn't blame them. A black dress and a sheer, 
flowing black veil spoke enough about her grief, and kept everyone at a long, 
long distance. As though her sorrow were a plague. 

But she didn't give a damn what the others thought; the mourning clothes 
weren't for them. She rounded the back of the mausoleum and beheld the 
rows of graves in the gravel garden behind it, the pale and worn stones 
illuminated by the moon. Statues depicting everything from mourning gods to 
dancing maidens marked the resting places of distinguished nobility, some so 
lifelike they seemed to be people frozen in stone. 

It had not snowed since before Nehemia's murder, so it was easy enough 
to spot the grave by the upturned earth before it. 

There were no flowers, not even a headstone. Just fresh soil and a sword 
thrust into the earth--one of the curved swords of Nehemia's fallen guards. 
Apparently, no one had bothered to give her anything more, not when she 
would be retrieved and brought back to Eyllwe. 

Celaena stared at the dark, tilled earth, a chill wind rustling her veil. 

Her chest ached, but this was the one last thing she had to do, the one last 
honor she could give her friend. 

Celaena tilted her head to the sky, closed her eyes, and began to sing. 


Chaol had told himself that he was only following Celaena to make sure she 
didn't hurt herself or anyone else, but as she'd neared the royal mausoleum, 
he followed for other reasons. 

The night provided good cover, but the moon was bright enough to keep 
him back, far enough away so she wouldn't see or hear his approach. But 
then he saw where she had stopped, and realized he had no right to be here 
for this. He'd been about to turn away when she lifted her face to the moon 
and sang. 

It was not in any language that he knew. Not in the common tongue, or in 
Eyllwe, or in the languages of Fenharrow or Melisande or anywhere else on 
the continent. 

This language was ancient, each word full of power and rage and agony. 


She did not have a beautiful voice. And many of the words sounded like 
half sobs, the vowels stretched by the pangs of sorrow, the consonants 
hardened by anger. She beat her breast in time, so full of savage grace, so at 
odds with the black gown and veil she wore. The hair on the back of his neck 
stood as the lament poured from her mouth, unearthly and foreign, a song of 
grief so old that it predated the stone castle itself. 

And then the song finished, its end as brutal and sudden as Nehemia's 
death had been. 

She stood there for a few moments, silent and unmoving. 

He was about to walk away when she half turned to him. 

Her thin silver circlet shimmered in the moonlight, weighing down a veil 
so concealing that only he had recognized her. 

A breeze whipped past them, making the branches of the trees moan and 
creak, setting her veil and skirts billowing to one side. 

"Celaena," he pleaded. She didn't move, her stillness the only sign that 
she'd heard him. And that she had no interest in talking. 

What could he ever say to repair the rift between them, anyway? He'd 
kept information from her. Even if he hadn't been directly responsible for 
Nehemia's death, if either girl had been more alert, they might have had their 
own defenses prepared. The loss she felt, the stillness with which she 
watched him--it was all his fault. 

If the punishment for that was losing her, then he'd endure it. 

So Chaol walked away, her lament still echoing through the night around 
him, carried on the wind like the pealing of distant bells. 


Chapter 38 


The dawn was chill and gray as Celaena stood in the familiar field of the 
game park, a large stick dangling between her gloved fingers. Fleetfoot sat 
before her, her tail slashing through the long, dried grass that poked up 
through the remaining layer of snow. But the hound didn't whine or bark for 
the stick to be thrown. 

No, Fleetfoot just kept sitting there, watching the palace far behind them. 
Waiting for someone who was never going to arrive. 

Celaena stared across the barren field, listening to the sighing grasses. No 
one had tried to stop her from leaving her rooms last night--or this morning. 
Yet even though the guards were gone, whenever she left her room, Ress had 
an uncanny habit of accidentally running into her. 

She didn't care if he reported her movements to Chaol. She didn't even 
care that Chaol had been spying on her at Nehemia's grave last night. Let him 
think what he would about the song. 

With a sharp intake of breath, she hurled the stick as hard as she could, so 
far it blended in with the cloudy morning sky. She didn't hear it land. 

Fleetfoot turned to look up at Celaena, her golden eyes full of question. 
Celaena reached down to stroke the warm head, the long ears, the slender 
muzzle. But the question remained. 

Celaena said, "She's never coming back." 

The dog kept waiting. 


Dorian had spent half the night in the library, searching in forgotten crevices, 
scouring every dark corner, every hidden nook, for any books on magic. 
There were none. It wasn't surprising, but given how many books were in the 
library, and how many twisting passageways there were, he was a little 
disappointed that nothing of worth could be found. 

He didn't even know what he would do with a book like that once he 
found it. He couldn't bring it back to his rooms, since his servants were 
likely to find it there. He would probably have to put it back in its hiding 
place and return to it whenever he could. 


He was scanning a bookshelf built into a stone alcove when he heard 
footsteps. Immediately, just as he'd rehearsed, he took out the book he'd 
tucked into his jacket and leaned against the wall, opening to a random page. 

"It's a little dark for reading," a female voice said. She sounded so 
normal, so like herself that Dorian nearly dropped the book. 

Celaena was standing a few feet away, arms crossed. Pitter-pattering feet 
echoed against the floors, and a moment later Dorian braced himself against 
the wall as Fleetfoot flung herself at him, all wagging tail and bountiful 
kisses. "Gods, you're huge," he told the dog. She licked his cheek one last 
time and sprinted off down the hall. Dorian watched her go, brows raised. 
"Pm fairly certain that whatever she's about to do, it won't make the 
librarians happy." 

"She knows to stick to the poetry and mathematics books." 

Celaena's face was grave and pale, but her eyes shone with faint 
amusement. She wore a dark blue tunic he'd never seen before, with golden 
embroidery that glinted in the dim light. In fact, her whole outfit looked new. 

The silence that settled between them made him shift on his feet. What 
could he possibly say to her? The last time they'd been this close, she'd 
grazed her nails across his neck. He'd had nightmares about that moment. 

"Can I help you find anything?" he asked her. Keep it normal, keep it 
simple. 

"Crown Prince and royal librarian?" 

"Unofficial royal librarian," he said. "A title hard-won after many years 
of hiding here to avoid stuffy meetings, my mother, and ... well, everything 
else." 

"And here I was, thinking you just hid in your little tower." 

Dorian laughed softly, but the sound somehow killed the amusement in her 
eyes. As if the sound of merriment was too raw against the wound of 
Nehemia's death. Keep it simple, he reminded himself. "So? Is there a book I 
can help you find? If that's a list of titles in your hand, then I could look them 
up in the catalog." 

"No," she said, folding the papers in half. "No, there's no book. I just 
wanted a walk." 

And he'd just come to a dark corner of the library to read. 

But he didn't push it, if only because she could easily start asking him 
questions, too. If she remembered what had happened when she attacked 


Chaol, that is. He hoped she didn't. 

There was a muffled shriek from somewhere in the library, followed by a 
string of howled curses and the familiar pitter-patter of paws on stone. Then 
Fleetfoot came sprinting down the row, a scroll of paper in her jaws. 

"Wicked beast!" a man was shouting. "Come back here at once!" 

Fleetfoot just zoomed on by, a blur of gold. 

A moment later, when the little librarian came waddling into view and 
asked if they'd seen a dog, Celaena only shook her head and said that she had 
heard something--from the opposite direction. And then she told him to keep 
his voice down, because this was a library. 

His eyes shooting daggers at her, the man huffed and scuttled away, his 
shouting a bit softer. 

When he was gone, Dorian turned to her, brows high on his head. "That 
scroll could have been invaluable." 

She shrugged. "He looked like he could use the exercise." 

And then she was smiling. Hesitantly at first, then she shook her head, and 
the smile bloomed wide enough to show her teeth. 

It was only when she looked at him again that he realized he'd been 
staring, trying to sort out the difference between this smile and the smile 
she'd given his father the day she'd put Grave's head on the council table. 

As if she could read his thoughts, she said, "I apologize for my behavior 
lately. I haven't ... been myself." 

Or she'd just been a part of herself that she usually kept on a tight, tight 
leash, he thought. But he said, "I understand." 

And from the way her eyes softened, he knew that was all he'd ever 
needed to say. 


Chaol wasn't hiding from his father. He wasn't hiding from Celaena. And he 
wasn't hiding from his men, who now felt some ridiculous urge to look after 
him. 

But the library did offer a good amount of refuge and privacy. 

Maybe answers, too. 

The head librarian wasn't in the little office tucked into one of walls of 
the library. So Chaol had asked an apprentice. The gawking youth pointed, 
gave some vague directions, and told him good luck. 


Chaol followed the boy's directions up a sweeping flight of black marble 
stairs and along the mezzanine rail. He was about to turn down an aisle of 
books when he heard them speaking. 

Actually, he heard Fleetfoot's prancing first, and looked over the marble 
rail in time to see Celaena and Dorian walking toward the towering main 
doors. They were a comfortable, casual distance apart, but ... but she was 
talking. Her shoulders were relaxed, her gait smooth. So different from the 
woman of shadow and darkness that he'd seen yesterday. 

What were the two of them doing here--together? 

It wasn't his business. Frankly, he was grateful that she was talking to 
anyone, and not burning her clothes or butchering rogue assassins. Still, 
something twanged in his heart that Dorian was the one beside her. 

But she was talking. 

So Chaol quickly turned from the balcony rail and walked deeper into the 
library, trying to shove the image from his mind. He found Harlan Sensel, the 
head librarian, huffing and puffing down one of the main paths through the 
library, shaking a fistful of paper shreds at the air around him. 

Sensel was so busy cursing that he hardly noticed when Chaol stepped in 
his path. The librarian had to tilt his head back to see Chaol, and then 
frowned at him. 

"Good, you're here," Sensel said, and resumed walking. "Higgins must 
have sent word." 

Chaol had no idea what Sensel was talking about. "Is there some issue 
that you need assistance with?" 

"Issue!" Sensel waved the shredded papers. "There are feral beasts 
running amok in my library! Who let that--that creature in here? I demand 
that they pay!" 

Chaol had had a feeling that Celaena had something to do with this. He 
just hoped she and Fleetfoot were out of the library before Sensel reached 
the office. 

"What sort of scroll was damaged? P11 see to it that they replace it." 

"Replace it!" Sensel sputtered. "Replace this?" 

"What, exactly, is it?" 

"A letter! A letter from a very close friend of mine!" 

He bit back his annoyance. "If it's just a letter, then I don't think the 
creature's owner can offer a payment. Though perhaps they'd be happy to 


donate a few books in--" 

"Throw them in the dungeons! My library has become little more than a 
circus! Did you know that there's a cloaked person skulking about the stacks 
at all hours of the night? They probably unleashed that horrible beast in the 
library! So track them down and--" 

"The dungeons are full," Chaol lied. "But P11 look into it." While Sensel 
finished his rant about the truly exhausting hunt he'd gone on to retrieve the 
letter, Chaol debated whether he should just leave. 

But he had questions, and once they reached the mezzanine and he was 
certain that Celaena, Fleetfoot, and Dorian were long gone, he said, "I have a 
question for you, sir." 

Sensel preened at the honorific, and Chaol tried his best to look 
uninterested. 

"If I wanted to look up funeral dirges--laments--from other kingdoms, 
where would be the best place to start?" 

Sensel gave hima confused look, then said, ""What a dreadful subject." 

Chaol shrugged and took a shot in the dark. "One of my men is from 
Terrasen, and his mother recently died, so Pd like to honor him by learning 
one of their songs." 

"Is that what the king pays you to do--learn sad songs with which to 
serenade your men?" 

He almost snorted at the idea of serenading his men, but shrugged again. 
"Are there any books where those songs might be?" 

Even a day later, he couldn't get the song out of his head, couldn't stop the 
chill that went up his neck when its words echoed through his mind. And then 
there were those other words, the words that had changed everything: You 
will always be my enemy. 

She was hiding something--a secret she kept locked up so tight that only 
the horror and shattering loss of that night could have made her slip in such a 
way. So the more he could discover about her, the better chance he stood of 
being prepared when the secret came to light. 

"Hmm," the little librarian said, walking down the main steps. "Well, 
most of the songs were never written down. And why would they be?" 

"Surely the scholars in Terrasen recorded some of them. Orynth had the 
greatest library in Erilea at one time," Chaol countered. 


"That they did," Sensel said, a twinge of sorrow in his words. "But I 
don't think anyone ever bothered to write down their dirges. At least, not ina 
way that would have made it here." 

"What about in other languages? My guard from Terrasen mentioned 
something about a dirge he once heard sung in another tongue--though he 
never learned what it was." 

The librarian stroked his silver beard. "Another language? Everyone in 
Terrasen speaks the common tongue. No one's spoken a different language 
there for a thousand years." 

They were close to the office, and he knew that once they arrived, the 
little bastard would probably shut him out until he'd brought Fleetfoot to 
justice. Chaol pressed a bit harder. "So there are no dirges in Terrasen that 
are sung in a different language?" 

"No," he said, drawing out the word as he pondered. "But I once heard 
that in the high court of Terrasen, when the nobility died, they sang their 
laments in the language of the Fae." 

Chaol's blood froze and he almost tripped, but he managed to keep 
walking and say, "Would these songs have been known by everyone--not just 
the nobility?" 

"Oh, no," Sensel said, only half-listening as he recited whatever history 
was in his head. "Those songs were sacred to the court. Only those of noble 
blood ever learned or sang them. They were taught and sung in secret, their 
dead buried by the light of the moon, when no other ears could hear them. At 
least, that's what rumor claimed. [ll admit to my own morbid curiosity in 
that ''d hoped to hear them ten years ago, but by the time the slaughter had 
ended, there was no one left in those noble houses to sing them." 

No one, except ... 

You will always be my enemy. 

"Thank you," Chaol got out, then quickly turned away, walking toward the 
exit. Sensel called after him, demanding his oath that he'd find the dog and 
punish it, but Chaol didn't bother to reply. 

Which house did she belong to? Her parents hadn't just been murdered-- 
they were part of the nobility who had been executed by the king. 

Slaughtered. 

She'd been found in their bed--after they'd been killed. And then she 
must have run until she found the place where a Terrasen nobleman's 


daughter could hide: the Assassins' Keep. She'd learned the only skills that 
could keep her safe. To escape death, she'd become death. 

Regardless of what territory her parents had lorded over, if Celaena ever 
took up the mantle she'd lost, and if Terrasen ever got to its feet ... 

Then Celaena could become a powerhouse--potentially capable of 
standing against Adarlan. And that made Celaena more than just his enemy. 

It made her the greatest threat he'd ever encountered. 


Chapter 39 


Crouched in the shadow of a chimney atop a pretty little townhouse, Celaena 
watched the home next door. For the last thirty minutes, people had been 
slipping inside, all cloaked and hooded--looking like nothing more than cold 
patrons eager to get out of the freezing night. 

She'd meant it when she told Archer she wanted nothing to do with him or 
his movement. And honestly, there was a part of her that wondered whether 
she should just kill them all and toss their heads at the king's feet. But 
Nehemia had been a part of this group. And even if Nehemia had pretended 
she didn't know anything about these people ... they were still her people. 
She hadn't lied to Archer when she told him that she'd bought him a few 
extra days; after turning over Councilor Mullison, the king didn't hesitate to 
grant her a bit more time to kill the courtesan. 

A snow flurry gusted up, veiling her view of the front of Archer's 
townhouse. To anyone else, the gathering would seem like a dinne party for 
his clients. She knew only few of the faces--and bodies--that hurried up the 
steps, people who hadn't fled the kingdom or been killed by her the night 
everything went to hell. 

There were many more, however, whose names she didn't know. She 
recognized the guard who had stood between her and Chaol at the warehouse 
--the man who had been so eager for a fight. Not by his face, which had been 
masked that night, but by the way he moved, and by the twin swords strapped 
to his back. He still wore a hood, but she could see shoulder-length dark hair 
gleaming beneath it, and what looked like the tan skin of a young man. 

He paused at the bottom step, turning to quietly utter commands to the two 
hooded men flanking him. With a nod, they vanished into the night. 

She contemplated trailing one of them. But she'd come here only to check 
on Archer, to see what he was up to. She planned to keep checking on him 
until the moment he got on that boat and sailed away. And once he was gone, 
once she'd given the king his fake corpse ... She didn't know what she'd do 
then. 

Celaena slipped farther behind the brick chimney as one of the guards 
scanned the rooftops for any signs of trouble before continuing on his way-- 


to watch one end of the street, if she guessed correctly. 

She stayed in the shadows for a few hours, moving to the rooftop across 
the street to better watch the front of the house, until the guests started 
leaving, one by one, looking for all the world like drunken revelers. She 
counted them, and marked what directions they went in and who walked with 
them, but the young man with the twin swords didn't emerge. 

She might have convinced herself that he was another client of Archer's, 
even his lover, had the stranger's two guards not returned and slipped inside. 

As the front door opened, she caught a glimpse of a tall, broad-shouldered 
young man arguing with Archer in the foyer. His back was to the door, but his 
hood was off--confirming that he did indeed have night-black shoulder- 
length hair and was armed to the teeth. She could see nothing else. His guards 
immediately flanked him, keeping her from getting a closer look before the 
door shut again. 

Not very careful--not very inconspicuous. 

A moment later, the young man stormed out, hooded once more, his two 
men at his side. Archer stood in the open doorway, his face visibly pale, 
arms crossed. The young man paused at the bottom of the steps, turning to 
give Archer a particularly vulgar gesture. 

Even from this distance, Celaena could see the smile that Archer gave the 
man in return. There was nothing kind in it. 

She wished she'd been close enough to hear what they'd said, to 
understand what this was all about. 

Before, she would have trailed the young stranger to seek out the answers. 

But that was before. Now ... now, she didn't particularly care. 

It was hard to care, she realized as she started the trek back to the castle. 
Incredibly hard to care, when you didn't have anyone left to care about. 


Celaena didn't know what she was doing at this door. Even though the guards 
at the foot of the tower had let her pass after checking her thoroughly for 
weapons, she didn't doubt for one moment that word would go right to 
Chaol. 

She wondered if he'd dare stop her. If he'd ever dare to utter another 
word to her. Last night, even from the distance at the moonlit graveyard, 


she'd seen the still-healing cuts on his cheek. She didn't know whether they 
filled her with satisfaction or guilt. 

Every little bit of interaction was draining, somehow. How exhausted 
would she be after tonight? 

Celaena sighed and knocked on the wooden door. She was five minutes 
late--minutes she'd spent debating whether she truly wanted to accept 
Dorian's offer to dine with him in his rooms. She'd almost eaten dinner in 
Rifthold instead. 

There was no answer to her knock at first, so she turned away, trying to 
avoid looking at the guards posted on the landing. It was stupid to come here, 
anyway. 

She had just taken a step down the spiral staircase when the door opened. 

"You know, I think this is the first time you've been to my little tower," 
Dorian said. 

Foot still in the air, Celaena collected herself before looking over her 
shoulder at the Crown Prince. 

"I was expecting more doom and gloom," she said, walking back to the 
door. "It's quite cozy." 

He held the door open and nodded to his guards. "No need to worry," he 
told them as Celaena walked into the prince's chambers. 

She'd expected grandeur and elegance, but Dorian's tower was--well, 
"cozy" was a good way to describe it. A bit shabby, too. There was a faded 
tapestry, a soot-stained fireplace, a moderate-size four-poster bed, a desk 
heaped with papers by the window, and books. Stacks and mountains and 
towers and columns of books. They covered every surface, every bit of space 
along the walls. 

"I think you need your own personal librarian," she muttered, and Dorian 
laughed. 

She hadn't realized how much she missed that sound. Not just his laugh, 
but her own, too; any laugh, really. Even if it felt wrong to laugh these days, 
she missed it. 

"If my servants had their way, these would all go to the library. They make 
dusting rather hard." He stooped to pick up some clothes he'd left on the 
floor. 

"From the mess, I'm surprised to hear you even have servants." 


Another laugh as he carried the pile of clothes toward a door. It opened 
just wide enough to reveal a dressing room nearly as big as her own, but she 
saw no more than that before he chucked the clothes inside and shut the door. 
Across the room, another door had to lead to a bathing chamber. "I have a 
habit of telling them to go away," he said. 

"Why?" She walked to the worn red couch before the fireplace and 
pushed off the books that were piled there. 

"Because 7 know where everything in this room is. All the books, the 
papers--and the moment they start cleaning, those things get hopelessly 
organized and tucked away, and I can never find them again." He was 
straightening the red cloth of his bedspread, which looked rumpled enough to 
suggest he'd been sprawled across it until she'd knocked. 

"Don't you have people who dress you? I would have thought that Roland 
would be your devoted servant, at least." 

Dorian snorted, plumping his pillows. "Roland's tried. Thankfully, he's 
been suffering from awful headaches lately and has backed off." That was 
good to hear--sort of. The last she'd bothered to check, the Lord of Meah 
had indeed become close to Dorian--a friend, even. "And," Dorian went on, 
"aside from my refusal to find a bride, my mother's greatest annoyance is my 
refusal to be dressed by lords eager to win my favor." 

That was unexpected. Dorian was always so well dressed that she 
assumed he had people doing it for him. 

He went to the door to tell the guards to have their dinner brought up. 
"Wine?" he asked from the window, where a bottle and a few glasses were 
kept. 

She shook her head, wondering where they would even eat their food. The 
desk wasn't an option, and the table before the fireplace was a miniature 
library on its own. As if in answer, Dorian began clearing the table. "Sorry," 
he said sheepishly. "I meant to clear a space to eat before you got here, but I 
got wrapped up in reading." 

She nodded, and silence fell between them, interrupted only by the thud 
and hiss of him moving books. 

"So," Dorian said quietly, "can I ask why you decided to join me for 
dinner? You've made it pretty clear that you didn't want to spend any time 
with me--and I thought you had work to do tonight." 


Actually, she'd been downright awful to him. But he kept his back to her, 
as though the question didn't matter. 

And she didn't quite know why the words came out, but she spoke the 
truth anyway. "Because I have nowhere else to go." 

Sitting in her rooms in silence made the pain worse, going to the tomb 
only frustrated her, and the thought of Chaol still hurt so badly she couldn't 
breathe. Every morning, she walked Fleetfoot by herself, then ran alone in the 
game park. Even the girls who had once lined the garden pathways, waiting 
for Chaol, had stopped showing up. 

Dorian nodded, looking at her with kindness she couldn't stand. "Then 
you will always have a place here." 


While their dinner was quiet, it wasn't lachrymose. But Dorian could still 
see the change in her--the hesitation and consideration behind her words, the 
moments when she thought he wasn't looking and an endless sorrow filled 
her eyes. She kept talking to him, though, and answered all his questions. 

Because I have nowhere else to go. 

It wasn't an insult, not the way she'd said it. And now that she was dozing 
on his couch, the clock having recently chimed two, he wondered what was 
keeping her from going back to her own rooms. Clearly, she didn't want to be 
alone--and maybe she needed to be in a place that didn't remind her of 
Nehemia. 

Her body was a patchwork of scars; he'd seen it with his own eyes. But 
these new scars might go deeper: the pain of losing Nehemia, and the 
different, but perhaps just as agonizing, loss of Chaol. 

An awful part of him was glad she'd cut out Chaol. He hated himself for 
it. 


"There has to be something more here," Celaena said to Mort as she combed 
through the tomb the following afternoon. 

Yesterday, she'd read the riddle until her eyes ached. Still it offered no 
hint about what the objects might be, where precisely they were concealed, 
or why the riddle had been hidden so elaborately in the tomb. "Some sort of 
clue. Something that connects the riddle to the rebel movement and Nehemia 


and Elena and all the rest." She paused between the two sarcophagi. Sunlight 
spilled in, setting the dust motes shimmering. "It's staring me in the face, I 
know it." 

"Pm afraid I can't be of service," Mort sniffed. "If you want an instant 
answer, you should find yourself a seer or an oracle." 

Celaena slowed her pacing. "You think if I read this to someone with the 
gift of clairvoyance, they might be able to ... see some different meaning that 
Pm missing?" 

"Perhaps. Though as far as I know, when magic vanished, those with the 
gift of Sight lost it, too." 

"Yes, but you 're still here." 

"So?" 

Celaena looked at the stone ceiling as if she could see through it, all the 
way to the ground above. "So perhaps other ancient beings might retain some 
of their gifts, too." 

"Whatever it is you're thinking, I guarantee it's a bad idea." 

Celaena gave hima grim smile. "I'm pretty sure you' re right." 


Chapter 40 


Celaena stood before the caravans, watching as the tents were taken apart. 
Fortunate timing. 

She ran a hand through her unbound hair and straightened her brown tunic. 
Finery would have attracted too much attention. And even if it was just for an 
hour, she couldn't help but savor the feeling of anonymity, of blending in with 
the carnival workers, these people who had the dust of a hundred kingdoms 
on their clothes. To have that sort of freedom, to see the world bit by bit, to 
travel each and every road ... Her chest tightened. 

People streamed by, hardly glancing at her as she made her way to the 
black wagon. This could easily be folly, but what harm was there in asking? 
If Yellowlegs truly was a witch, then perhaps she had the gift of Sight. 
Perhaps she could make sense of the riddle in the tomb. 

When Celaena reached the wagon, it was mercifully devoid of patrons. 
Baba Yellowlegs sat on the top stair, smoking a long bone pipe whose bowl 
was shaped like a screaming mouth. Pleasant. 

"Come to look into the mirrors?" she said, smoke spilling from her 
withered lips. "Done running from fate at last?" 

"I have some questions for you." 

The witch sniffed her, and Celaena fought the urge to step back. "You do 
indeed stink of questions--and the Staghorn Mountains. From Terrasen, are 
you? What's your name?" 

Celaena stuck her hands deep in her pockets. "Lillian Gordaina." 

The witch spat on the ground. "What's your real name, Lillian?" Celaena 
stiffened. Yellowlegs crowed with laughter. "Come," she cawed, "want to 
have your fortune told? I can tell you who you'll marry, how many children 
you ll have, when you'll die ..." 

"If you're indeed as good as you claim, you know I'm not interested in 
those things. Pd like to talk to you instead," Celaena said, flashing the three 
gold coins in her palm. 

"Cheap goat," Yellowlegs said, taking another long drag from the pipe. 
"That's all my gifts are worth to you?" 

Perhaps this would be a waste of time. And money. And pride. 


Celaena turned away with a scowl, shoving her hands into the pockets of 
her dark cloak. 

"Wait," Yellowlegs said. 

Celaena kept walking. 

"The prince gave me four coins." 

She paused and looked over her shoulder at the crone. A cold, clawed 
hand gripped her heart. 

Yellowlegs smiled at her. "He had such interesting questions, too. He 
thought I didn't recognize him, but I can smell Havilliard blood a mile off. 
Seven gold pieces, and l I1 answer your questions--and tell you his." 

She'd sell Dorian's questions to her--to anyone? That familiar calm went 
through her. "How do I know you're not lying?" 

Yellowlegs's iron teeth glinted in the light of the torches. "It would be bad 
for business if I were branded a liar. Would it make you more comfortable if 
I swore on one of your soft-hearted gods? Or perhaps on one of mine?" 

Celaena studied the black wagon, swiftly braiding her hair back. One 
door, no back exit, no sign of trick panels. No way out, and plenty of warning 
in case someone came in. She checked her weapons--two long daggers, a 
knife in her boot, and three of Philippa's deadly hairpins. More than enough. 

"Make it six coins," Celaena said softly, "and I won't report you to the 
guard for trying to sell the prince's secrets." 

"Who says the guard won't be interested in them, too? You'd be surprised 
how many people want to know what truly interests the prince of the realm." 

Celaena slammed six gold coins onto the step beside the tiny crone. 
"Three pieces for my questions," she said, bringing her face as close to 
Yellowlegs's as she dared. The reek from the woman's mouth was like 
carrion and stale smoke. "And three for your silence about the prince." 

Yellowlegs's eyes gleamed, her iron nails clinking together as she 
stretched out a hand to grab the coins. "Get in the caravan." The door behind 
her swung open soundlessly. A dark interior lay beyond, speckled with 
patches of glimmering light. Yellowlegs snuffed out her bone pipe. 

She'd been hoping for this--to get inside the caravan, and thus avoid 
having anyone see her with Yellowlegs. 

The old woman groaned as she stood, a hand braced on her knee. "Care to 
tell me your name now?" 


A chill wind blew from within the caravan, sliding along Celaena's neck. 
Carnival trick. "Ill ask the questions," Celaena said, and stalked up the steps 
into the caravan. 

Inside, there were a few measly candles, whose light flickered along row 
after row, stack after stack, of mirrors. They were every shape, every size, 
some leaning against the walls, some propped against each other like old 
friends, some little more than shards clinging to their frames. 

And everywhere else, wherever there was a bit of space, were papers and 
scrolls, jars full of herbs or liquids, brooms ... junk. 

In the gloom, the caravan stretched on much wider and longer than should 
have been possible. A winding path had been made between the mirrors, 
leading into the dark--a path that Yellowlegs was now treading, as if there 
were anywhere to go inside this strange place. 

This can t be real--it must be an illusion of the mirrors. 

Celaena glanced back toward the wagon door in time to see it snick shut. 
Her dagger was out before the sound had finished echoing through the wagon. 
Ahead, Yellowlegs chuckled, lifting the candle in her hand. Its holder seemed 
to be shaped like a skull mounted on some sort of longer bone. 

Tacky, cheap carnival tricks, Celaena told herself again and again, her 
breath clouding in the chill air inside the wagon. None of it was real. But 
Yellowlegs--and the knowledge she offered--truly was. 

"Come along, girl. Come sit with me where we might talk." 

Celaena carefully stepped over a fallen mirror, keeping an eye on the 
bobbing skull-lantern--and on the door, any possible exits (none as far as 
she could see, but perhaps there was a trapdoor in the floor), and how the 
woman moved. 

Surprisingly fast, she realized, and hurried to catch up to Yellowlegs. As 
she strode through the forest of mirrors, her reflection shifted everywhere. In 
one she appeared short and fat, in another tall and impossibly thin. In another 
she stood upside down, and in yet another she walked sideways. It was 
enough to give her a headache. 

"Done gawking?" Yellowlegs said. Celaena ignored her, but sheathed her 
dagger as she followed the woman into a small sitting area before a dim, 
grated oven. No reason to have her weapon out--not when she still needed 
Yellowlegs to cooperate. 


The sitting area lay in a rough circle cleared of junk and stacks of mirrors, 
with little more than a rug and a few chairs to make it hospitable. Yellowlegs 
hobbled over to the raised hearthstone, yanking a few logs from a tiny stack 
perched on the rim. Celaena remained on the edge of the worn red rug, 
watching as Yellowlegs threw open the iron grate of the oven, tossed in the 
wood, and slammed the grate shut again. Within seconds, light flared, made 
brighter still by the surrounding mirrors. 

"The stones of this oven," Yellowlegs said, patting the curved wall of 
dark bricks like an old pet, "came from the ruins of the Crochan capital city. 
The wood of this wagon was hewn from the walls of their sacred schools. 
That's why my wagon is ... unusual inside." 

Celaena said nothing. It would have been easy to dismiss it as a bit of 
carnival dramatics, except she was seeing it for herself. 

"So," Yellowlegs said, remaining standing as well, despite the aged 
wooden furniture scattered around them. "Questions." 

Even though the air in the wagon was chill, the burning oven somehow 
made it instantly warm--warm enough for Celaena's layers of clothing to be 
uncomfortable. She'd been told a story once, on a hot summer night in the 
Red Desert; a story about what one of the long-lost Ironteeth witches had 
done to a young girl. What had been left of her. 

Gleaming white bones. Nothing more. 

Celaena glanced at the oven again and angled herself closer to the door. 
Across the small sitting area, more mirrors waited in the gloom--as if even 
the light of the fire couldn't reach them. 

Yellowlegs leaned closer to the grate, rubbing her gnarled fingers in front 
of it. The firelight danced along her iron nails. "Ask away, girl." 

What had Dorian wanted to know so badly? Had he come inside this 
strange, smothering place? At least he'd survived. If only because 
Yellowlegs wanted to use whatever information she'd gleaned from him. 
Foolish, foolish man. 

Was she any different, though? 

This might be her only chance to learn what she needed to know, despite 
the risk, despite how messy and complicated the aftermath might be. 

"I found a riddle, and my friends have been debating its answer for 
weeks. We even have a bet going about it," she said as vaguely as she could. 


"Answer it, if you're so clever and all-knowing. Pll toss in an extra gold 
coin if you get it right." 

"Impudent children. Wasting my time with this nonsense." Yellowlegs 
watched the mirrors now, as if she could see something Celaena couldn't. 

Or as if she's already bored. 

Some of the tightness in her chest loosening, Celaena pulled the riddle 
from her pocket and read it aloud. 

When she was done, Yellowlegs slowly turned her head to Celaena, her 
voice low and rough. "Where did you find that?" 

Celaena shrugged. "Give me the answer and I might tell you. What sort of 
objects does this riddle describe?" 

"Wyrdkeys," Yellowlegs breathed, eyes glowing. "It describes the three 
Wyrdkeys to open the Wyrdgate." 

Cold slithered down Celaena's spine, but she said, with more bravado 
than she felt, "Tell me what they are--the Wyrdkeys, the Wyrdgate. For all I 
know, you might be lying about the answer. I'd rather not be made a fool of." 

"This information is not for the idle games of mortals," Yellowlegs 
snapped. 

Gold gleamed in Celaena's palm. "Name your price." 

The woman studied her from head to toe, sniffing once. "Nameless is my 
price," Yellowlegs said. "But gold will do for now." 

Celaena set five extra gold coins down on the hearthstone, the heat from 
the flame singeing her face. Such a small fire, but she was already slick with 
sweat. 

"Once you know this, there is no unknowing it," the witch warned. And 
from the gleam in Yellowlegs's eyes, Celaena knew that the old woman 
hadn't bought her lie about the bet for one heartbeat. 

Celaena took a step closer. "Tell me." 

Yellowlegs looked toward another mirror. "The Wyrd governs and forms 
the foundation of this world. Not just Erilea, but a// life. There are worlds 
that exist beyond your knowledge, worlds that lie on top of each other and 
don't know it. Right now, you could be standing on the bottom of someone 
else's ocean. The Wyrd keeps these realms apart." 

Yellowlegs began to hobble around the sitting area, lost in her own 
words. 


"There are gates--black areas in the Wyrd that allow for life to pass 
between the worlds. There are Wyrdgates that lead to Erilea. All sorts of 
beings have come through them over the eons. Benign things, but also the 
dead and foul things that creep in when the gods are looking elsewhere." 

Yellowlegs disappeared behind a mirror, her uneven steps echoing along. 
"But long ago, before humans overran this miserable world, a different sort 
of evil broke through the gates: the Valg. Demons from another realm, bent on 
the conquest of Erilea, and with the force of an endless army behind them. In 
Wendlyn, they fought against the Fae. Try as the immortal children might, they 
could not defeat them. 

"Then the Fae learned that the Valg had done something unforgivable. 
They had taken a piece of a Wyrdgate with their dark magic, and split it into 
three slivers--three keys. One key for each of their kings. Using all three at 
once, the Valg Kings were able to open that Wyrdgate at will, to manipulate 
its power to strengthen their forces, to allow an endless line of soldiers to 
pour into the world. The Fae knew that they must stop it." 

Celaena stared at the fire, at the mirrors, at the darkness of the wagon 
around her. The heat was smothering now. 

"And so a small band of Fae set out to steal them from the Valg Kings," 
Yellowlegs said, her voice coming nearer again. "It was an impossible task; 
most of those fools didn't return. 

"But the Wyrdkeys were indeed retrieved, and the Fae Queen Maeve 
banished the Valg to their realm. Yet for all her wisdom, Maeve couldn't 
discover how to put the keys back in the gate--and no forge, no steel, no 
weight could destroy them. So Maeve, believing that no one should have 
their power, sent them across the sea with Brannon Galathynius, first King of 
Terrasen, to hide on this continent. And thus the Wyrdgate remained 
protected, its power unused." 

Silence fell. Even Yellowlegs's hobbling steps had slowed. 

"So the riddle is a ... a map to where the keys are hidden?" Celaena 
asked, trembling now as she realized just what kind of power Nehemia and 
the others had been after. Worse, what the king might be after. 

"Yes." 

Celaena licked her lips. "What might one do with the Wyrdkeys?" 

"The person who holds all three Wyrdkeys would have control over the 
broken Wyrdgate--and all Erilea. They would be able to open and close the 


gate at will. They could conquer new worlds or let in all sorts of life to bend 
to their cause. But even one key could make someone immensely dangerous. 
Not enough power to open the gate, but enough to be a threat. You see, the 
keys themselves are pure power--power to be shaped as the wielder wills 
it. Tempting, isn't it?" 

The words echoed through her, blending with Elena's command to find 
and destroy the source of evil. Evil. Evil that had arisen ten years ago, when 
a whole continent had suddenly found itself at mercy of one man--a man who 
had somehow become unstoppable. 

A source of power that existed outside of magic. "It can't be." 

Yellowlegs only let out a confirming chuckle. 

Celaena kept shaking her head, her heart beating so violently she could 
hardly breathe. "The king has some of the Wyrdkeys? That's how he was able 
to conquer the continent so easily?" But if he'd already done that--then what 
further plans did he have? 

"Perhaps," Yellowlegs said. "If I were to wager my hard-earned gold, Pd 
say he has at least one." 

Celaena scanned the dark, the mirrors, but saw only versions of herself 
looking back. She heard nothing but the crackling of the fire in the oven and 
her own uneven breathing. 

Yellowlegs had stopped moving. 

"Is there anything else?" Celaena demanded. 

No response from the old woman. 

"So you're going to take my money and run?" Celaena eased toward the 
winding path through the mirrors, and the door that now seemed impossibly 
far away. "What if I still have questions?" Her own movements in the mirrors 
sent her nerves jumping, but she kept alert and focused--reminded herself 
what she had to do. She drew both her daggers. 

"You think steel can hurt me?" came a voice that slithered across each 
mirror until its origin was everywhere and nowhere. 

"Here I was, thinking we were having a grand time," Celaena said, taking 
another step. 

"Bah. Who can have a grand time when your guest is planning to kill 
you?" 

Celaena smiled. 


"Isn't that why you're moving toward the door?" Yellowlegs went on. 
"Not to escape, but to make sure J don't get past your clever, wicked 
daggers?" 

"Tell me who else you've sold the prince's questions to and P11 let you 
go." Earlier, she'd been about to walk away--about to leave--when 
Yellowlegs's mention of Dorian had stopped her cold. Now she had no 
choice about what she had to do. What she would do to protect Dorian. It 
was what she'd realized last night: she did have someone left--one friend. 
And there was nothing she wouldn't do to keep him safe. 

"And if I say that Pve told no one?" 

"I wouldn't believe you." Celaena spied the door at last. No sign of the 
witch. She paused, roughly in the center of the wagon. It would be easier to 
catch the woman here--easier to make it quick and clean. 

"Pity," Yellowlegs said, and Celaena angled herself toward the 
disembodied voice. There had to be some hidden exit--but where? If 
Yellowlegs got out, if she told anyone what Dorian had asked (whatever it 
might be), if she told anyone what Celaena had asked ... 

All around Celaena, her reflection shifted and glimmered. Quick, clean, 
then she'd be gone. 

"What happens, 
hunted?" 

From the corner of her eye, Celaena glimpsed the hunched form, chains 
sagging between the gnarled hands. She whirled toward the crone, dagger 
already flying--to disable, to get her down so she could-- 

The mirror shattered where Yellowlegs had been standing. 

Behind her, there was a heavy clink, and a satisfied caw of laughter. 

For all her training, Celaena wasn't fast enough to duck before the heavy 
chain whipped across the side of her head, and she slammed face-first into 
the floor.

Yellowlegs hissed, "when the hunter becomes the 


Chapter 41 


Chaol and Dorian stood on a balcony and watched the carnival be dismantled 
bit by bit. It would leave tomorrow morning, and then Chaol could finally 
have his men back to doing useful things. Like making sure no other assassins 
got into the castle. 

But Chaol's most pressing problem was Celaena. Late last night, after the 
royal librarian had gone to bed, Chaol had returned to the library and found 
the genealogy records. Someone had gotten them all out of order, so it had 
taken him a while to locate the right one, but he at last found himself staring 
at the list of Terrasen's noble houses. 

None of them bore the name of Sardothien, though that was little surprise. 
Part of him had always known that wasn't Celaena's true name. So he'd 
made a list--a list that now sat in his pocket, burning a hole through it--of 
all the noble houses she might have come from, houses with children at the 
time of Terrasen's conquest. There were at least six families that had 
survived ... but what if she hailed from one that had been entirely 
slaughtered? When he had finished writing down the names, he was no closer 
to figuring out who she really was than he'd been at the start. 

"So, are you going to ask me whatever it is you dragged me out here to 
ask, or am I just going to enjoy freezing my ass off for the rest of the night?" 
Dorian said. 

Chaol raised a brow, and Dorian gave him a slight smile. 

"How is she?" Chaol asked. He'd heard that they'd had dinner--and that 
she hadn't left his rooms until the middle of the night. Had it been a 
deliberate move on her part? Something to throw in his face, make him ache 
just a bit more? 

"Coping," Dorian said. "Coping as best she can. And since I know you're 
too proud to ask it, Pll just tell you that no, she hasn't mentioned you. Nor do 
I think she will." 

Chaol took a long breath. How could he convince Dorian to stay away 
from her? Not because he was jealous, but because Celaena might be more of 
a threat than Dorian could ever imagine. Only the truth would work, but ... 


"Your father is curious about you," Dorian said. "After the council 
meetings, he always asks me about you. I think he wants you back in 
Anielle." 

"T know." 

"Are you going to go with him?" 

"Do you want me to?" 

"It's not for me to decide." 

Chaol clamped his teeth. He certainly wasn't going anywhere, not while 
Celaena was here. And not just because of who she actually was. "I have no 
interest in being Lord of Anielle." 

"Men would kill for the kind of power that Anielle wields." 

"Tve never wanted it." 

"No." Dorian braced his hands on the balcony rail. "No, you've never 
wanted anything for yourself, save for the position you have now, and 
Celaena." 

Chaol opened his mouth, excuses already forming on his tongue. 

"You think Pm blind?" Dorian asked, his gaze a frozen, ice blue. "Do you 
know why I approached her at the Yulemas ball? Not because I wanted to ask 
her to dance, but because I saw the way you two were looking at each other. 
Even then, I knew how you felt." 

"You knew, and yet you asked her to dance." His hands clenched into fists. 

"She's capable of making up her own mind. And she did." Dorian gave 
him a bitter smile. "About both of us." 

Chaol took a steadying breath, calming his rising anger. "If you feel the 
way you do, then why let her stay shackled to your father? Why not find a 
way to get her out of her contract? Or are you just afraid that if you set her 
free, she' Il never come back to you?" 

"Pd be careful what you say," Dorian said softly. 

But it was true. Even though he couldn't imagine a world without Celaena, 
Chaol knew he had to get her out of this castle. Yet he couldn't tell if it was 
for Adarlan's sake or her own. 

"My father is temperamental enough to punish me--and her--if I try to 
broach that subject. I agree with you, I truly do: it's not right to keep her here. 
But you should still mind what you say." The Crown Prince of Adarlan stared 
him down. "And consider where your true loyalties lie." 


Once, Chaol might have argued. Once, he might have protested that his 
loyalty to the crown was his greatest asset. But that blind loyalty and 
obedience had started this descent. 

And it had destroyed everything. 


Celaena knew she'd only been out for a few seconds, but it was long enough 
for Yellowlegs to yank her arms behind her back and get the chain around her 
wrists. Her head was pounding, and blood slid down the side of her neck, 
trickling into her tunic. Nothing too bad--she'd had worse wounds. Her 
weapons were gone, though, discarded somewhere in the wagon. Even the 
ones in her hair and clothes. And boots. Clever woman. 

So she didn't give the witch a chance, not even a heartbeat, to realize she 
was conscious. With no warning, she surged her shoulders up, throwing back 
her head as hard as she could. 

Bone cracked, and Yellowlegs howled, but Celaena had already twisted, 
getting her legs beneath her. Yellowlegs scrambled for the other end of the 
chain, fast as a viper. Celaena stomped on the length of chain between them, 
her other foot lashing out to meet Yellowlegs's face. 

The woman went flying, as though she were made of nothing but dust and 
wind, tumbling into the shadows between mirrors. 

Swearing under her breath, Celaena's wrists ached against the cold iron. 
But she'd been taught to free herself from worse. Arobynn had bound her up 
from head to toe and made her learn how to get loose, even if it meant 
spending two days prostrate on the ground in her own filth, or dislocating her 
shoulder to get out. So, not all that surprisingly, she had the chains off in a 
matter of seconds. 

She yanked a handkerchief from her pocket and used it to snatch up a long 
mirror shard. Angling the glass, Celaena peered into the shadows where 
Yellowlegs had gone flying. Nothing. Just a smear of dark blood. 

"Do you know how many young women I've trapped in this wagon in the 
past five hundred years?" Yellowlegs's voice was everywhere and nowhere. 
"How many Crochan witches I destroyed? They were warriors, too--such 
talented, beautiful warriors. They tasted like summer grass and cool water." 

Confirming that Yellowlegs was a blue-blooded Ironteeth witch changed 
nothing, Celaena told herself. Nothing, except that she'd have to find a bigger 


weapon. 

Celaena scanned the wagon--for the witch, for her lost daggers, for 
anything to use against the crone. Her gaze lifted to the shelves on the nearby 
wall. Books, crystal balls, paper, dead things in Jars ... 

Celaena would have missed it if she'd blinked. It was coated in dirt, but 
still gleamed faintly in the light of the distant oven. Mounted on the wall 
above a woodpile was a long, single-bladed ax. 

She smiled faintly as she yanked it off the wall. All around, Yellowlegs's 
image danced in the mirrors, a thousand possibilities for where she could be 
standing, watching, waiting. 

Celaena swung the ax at the nearest one. Then the next. And the next. 

The only way to kill a witch is to cut off her head. A friend had told her 
that once. 

Celaena wove between the mirrors, smashing them as she went, the 
reflections of the crone vanishing until the real witch stood along the narrow 
pathway between Celaena and the hearth, the chain back in her hands. 

Celaena hefted the ax over a shoulder. "One more chance," she breathed. 
"You agree to never say one word about me and Dorian, and P11 walk out of 
here." 

"I can taste your lies," Yellowlegs said. Faster than should be possible, 
she came for Celaena, scuttling like a spider, the chain swinging from her 
fingers. 

Celaena dodged the first whip of the chain. She heard the second before 
she saw it, and though it missed her, it struck a mirror and glass exploded 
everywhere. Celaena had no choice but to shield her eyes, to look away for 
one heartbeat. 

It was enough. 

The chain wrapped around her ankle, stinging and bruising, and then 
yanked. 

The world tilted as Yellowlegs pulled her feet out from under her, and 
Celaena went crashing to the floor. Yellowlegs rushed for her, but Celaena 
rolled across the shards, chain tangling around her, clinging to the ax with 
one hand, until her face brushed against the coarse fibers of the ancient rug 
before the oven. 

There was a firm yank on the chain, and then another whipping sound. 
Metal slammed into Celaena's forearm, so hard that she lost her grip on the 


ax. She flipped onto her back, still tangled in the infernal chain, only to find 
the iron teeth of Baba Yellowlegs looming above her. In a flash, the witch 
slammed Celaena back down into the carpet. 

The iron nails dug into her skin, drawing blood as the witch pinned her by 
the shoulder. "Hold still, you foolish girl," Yellowlegs hissed, grabbing for 
the length of the chain lying nearly. 

The rug scratched against Celaena's fingers as she stretched for the fallen 
ax, just inches out of reach. Her arm throbbed mercilessly, her ankle, too. If 
she could just get the ax ... Yellowlegs lunged for Celaena's neck, her teeth 
snapping. 

Celaena threw herself to the side, narrowly dodging those iron teeth, and 
grabbed the ax at last. She hauled it up so hard that its blunt end slammed into 
the side of the old woman's face. 

Yellowlegs was knocked away, collapsing in a heap of billowing brown 
robes. Celaena scrambled back and raised the weapon between them. 

Pushing to her hands and knees, Yellowlegs spat dark blood--blue blood 
--onto the aged rug, her eyes blazing. "I am going to make you wish you'd 
never been born. Both you and your prince." And then Yellowlegs shot 
forward so fast Celaena could have sworn she was flying. 

But she only got as far as Celaena's feet. 

Celaena brought the ax down, throwing every bit of strength into her arms. 
Blue blood sprayed everywhere. 

There was a smile on Baba Yellowlegs's decapitated head as it thudded 
to a stop. 

Quiet fell. Even the fire, still burning so hot that she was sweating again, 
seemed to have gone silent. Celaena swallowed. Once. Twice. 

Dorian couldn't know. Even though she wanted to scold him to high hell 
for asking questions that Yellowlegs had deemed valuable enough to sell to 
others, he couldn't know what had happened here. No one could. 

When she at last found the strength to disentangle herself, her pants and 
boots were stained blue-black. Another outfit to be burned. She studied the 
body and the stained, soaking carpet. It hadn't been quick, but it could still be 
clean. A missing person was better than a decapitated corpse. 

Celaena raised her eyes to the large oven grate. 


Chapter 42 


Mort chuckled when she staggered through the tomb door. "Witch Slayer, are 
you? Another lovely title to add to your repertoire." 

"How do you know about that?" she asked, setting down her candle. 
She'd already burned her bloodied clothes. They had reeked as they burned 
--treeked like rotting flesh, just as Yellowlegs had. Fleetfoot had growled at 
the fireplace and tried to herd Celaena away by pressing her body against her 
legs. 

"Oh, I can smell her on you," Mort said. "Smell her fury and wickedness." 

Celaena peeled back the collar of her tunic to show the little cuts where 
Yellowlegs's nails had pierced the skin right above her collarbone. She'd 
cleaned them out, but had a feeling they would leave marks, a necklace of 
scars. "What do you make of those?" 

Mort winced. "Those make me grateful I'm made of bronze." 

"Will they harm me?" 

"You killed a witch--and you're now marked by a witch. It will not be 
the usual sort of wound." Mort's eyes narrowed. "You understand that you 
may have just landed yourself in a heap of trouble." 

Celaena groaned. 

"Baba Yellowlegs was a leader--a queen to her clan," Mort went on. 
"When they destroyed the Crochan family, they joined with the Blackbeaks 
and the Bluebloods in the Ironteeth Alliance. They still honor those oaths." 

"But I thought all the witches were gone--scattered to the winds." 

"Gone? The Crochans and those who followed them have been in hiding 
for generations. But the clans in the Ironteeth Alliance still travel about, as 
Baba did. Though many more of them live in the ruined and dark places of 
the world, content in their wickedness. But I suspect that when the 
Yellowlegs learn of their matron's death, they will muster the Blackbeaks 
and the Bluebloods and demand answers from the king. And you will be 
fortunate if they do not come on their brooms and drag you into it." 

She grimaced. "I hope you're wrong." 

Mort's brows lowered slightly. "So do I." 


Celaena spent an hour in the tomb, reading through the riddle on the wall, 
puzzling over Yellowlegs's words. Wyrdkeys, Wyrdgates ... it was all so 
strange, so incomprehensible and terrifying. And if the king had them--if he 
even had one ... 

Celaena shuddered. 

When staring at the riddle gave her no further answers, Celaena trudged 
back to her rooms for a much-needed nap. 

At least she'd finally discovered a possible source of the king's power. 
But she still needed to learn more. And then the real question: what was the 
king planning to do with the keys that he had not done already? 

She had a feeling she didn't want to know. 

But the library catacombs might contain the answer to that most horrible 
of questions. There was a book she could use to gain access to that answer-- 
a book that might have the unlocking spell she was looking for. And she knew 
that The Walking Dead would find her the moment she began looking for it. 

Halfway up to her rooms, all plans for a nap vanished as Celaena turned 
back around and went to retrieve Damaris, and every other ancient blade she 
could carry. 


He shouldn't be here. He was only asking for trouble--another fight that 
might wind up tearing the castle in two. And if Celaena attacked him again, 
Chaol knew with absolute certainty that he'd let her kill him, if she really 
wanted. 

He didn't even know what he'd say to her. But he had to say something, if 
only to end the silence and the tension that kept him awake night after night 
and prevented him from focusing on his duties. 

She wasn't in her rooms, but he went in anyway, wandering over to her 
desk. It was as messy as Dorian's, and covered in papers and books. He 
might have turned away had he not seen the strange symbols written on 
everything, symbols that reminded him of the mark he'd seen burn on her 
forehead at the duel. He'd somehow forgotten about it in the months that had 
gone by. Was it ... was it something connected to her past? 

Glancing over his shoulder, listening for any sign of Philippa or Celaena, 
he rifled through the documents. Just scribblings--drawings of the symbols 


and random underlined words. Perhaps they were no more than doodles, he 
tried to tell himself. 

He was about to turn away when he caught sight of a document peeking 
out from a stack of books. It was written in careful calligraphy and signed by 
multiple people. 

Easing it out from under the books, Chaol picked up the thick paper and 
read. 

The world dropped out from beneath his feet. 

It was Celaena's will. Signed two days before Nehemia's death. 

And she'd given everything--every last copper--to him. 

His throat tightened as he stared at the sum and the list of assets, including 
an apartment in a warehouse in the slums and all the wealth inside. 

And she had signed it all to him, with only one request: that he consider 
giving some of it to Philippa. 

"T'm not going to change it." 

He whirled, finding her leaning against the doorframe, her arms crossed. 
Though the position was so familiar, her face was cold, blank. He let the 
document slip from his fingers. 

The list of noble houses in his pocket became leaden. What if he'd been 
jumping to conclusions? Perhaps the song wasn't actually a dirge of 
Terrasen. Maybe it had been another language he'd never heard of. 

She watched him like a cat. "It would be too much trouble to bother 
changing it," she went on. She wore a beautiful, ancient-looking blade at her 
side, along with a few daggers he'd never seen before. Where had she gotten 
them? 

There were so many words trying to work their way out of him that he 
couldn't speak at all. All of that money--she'd left everything to him. Left it 
to him because of what she'd felt for him ... even Dorian had seen it from the 
Start. 

"At least now," she said, pushing off the doorframe and turning away, 
"when the king sacks you for being so damn lousy at your job, you'll have 
something to fall back on." 

He couldn't breathe. She hadn't just done it out of generosity. But rather 
because she knew that if he ever lost his position, he'd have to consider 
going back to Anielle, to his father's money. And that it'd kill part of him to 
do that.

But she'd have to be dead for him to see that money. Verifiably dead, and 
not a traitor to the crown, either--if she died a traitor, then all her assets had 
to go to the king. 

And the only way she'd die a traitor would be for her to do what he 
feared: ally with this secret organization, find Aelin Galathynius, and return 
to Terrasen. This was a hint that she had no intention of doing that. She had 
no plans to reclaim her lost title, and posed no threat to Adarlan or Dorian. 
He'd been wrong. Yet again, he'd been wrong. 

"Get out of my chambers," she said from the foyer, before striding into the 
gaming room and slamming the door behind her. 

He hadn't wept when Nehemia died, or when he'd thrown Celaena in the 
dungeons, or even when she'd returned with Grave's head, utterly different 
from the woman he had grown to love so fiercely. 

But when Chaol walked out, leaving that damning will behind him, he 
didn't even make it to his own room. He barely made it into an empty broom 
closet before the sobs hit. 


Chapter 43 


Celaena stood in the gaming room, staring at the pianoforte as she heard 
Chaol quickly leave. She hadn't played in weeks. 

Originally, it had been just because she didn't have time. Because Archer 
and the tomb and Chaol had occupied every moment of her day. Then 
Nehemia had died--and she hadn't gone into this room once, hadn't wanted 
to look at the instrument, hadn't wanted to hear or make music ever again. 

Shoving the encounter with Chaol out of her mind, Celaena slowly folded 
back the lid of the pianoforte and stroked the ivory keys. 

But she couldn't push down, couldn't bring herself to make a sound. 
Nehemia should have been here--to help with Yellowlegs and the riddle, to 
tell her what to do with Chaol, to smile as Celaena played something 
particularly clever for her. 

Nehemia was gone. And the world ... it was moving on without her. 

When Sam had died, she had tucked him into her heart, tucked him in 
alongside her other beloved dead, whose names she kept so secret she 
sometimes forgot them. But Nehemia--Nehemia wouldn't fit. It was as if her 
heart was too full of the dead, too full of those lives that had ended well 
before their time. 

She couldn't seal Nehemia away like that, not when that bloodstained bed 
and those ugly words still haunted her every step, every breath. 

So Celaena just hovered at the pianoforte, tracing her fingers over the 
keys again and again, and let the silence devour her. 


An hour later, Celaena stood before the strange, second staircase at the end 
of the forgotten hall of ancient records, a clock chiming somewhere far in the 
library above. The images of Fae and flora danced along the fire-lit 
stairwell, spiraling out of sight, down and down into unknown depths. She'd 
found The Walking Dead almost immediately--discarded on a lonely table 
between some stacks. As though it had been waiting for her. And it had been 
the work of a few minutes to find a spell inside that claimed to unlock any 
door. She'd quickly memorized it, practicing a few times on a locked closet. 


It had taken all of her self-control not to scream when she'd heard the lock 
snap free the first time. Or the second. 

It was no wonder Nehemia and her family kept such power a secret. And 
no wonder the King of Adarlan had sought it out for himself. 

Staring down into the stairwell, Celaena touched Damaris, then looked at 
the two jeweled daggers hanging from her belt. She was fine. No reason to 
be nervous. What sort of evil did she expect to find in a library, of all 
places? 

Surely the king had better places to hide his dark dealings. At best, she'd 
find more hints as to whether he had any Wyrdkeys and where he kept them. 
At worst ... she would run into the cloaked person she'd seen outside the 
library that night. But the glowing eyes she'd glimpsed on the other side of 
that door belonged to a rodent of some sort--nothing more. And if she was 
wrong ... Well, whatever it was, after taking down the ridderak, this 
shouldn't be too hard, right? 

Right. Celaena stepped forward, pausing on the landing. 

Nothing. No feelings of terror, no otherworldly warnings. Not a thing. 

She took another step, then another, holding her breath as she wound 
around the staircase until she could no longer see the top. She could have 
sworn that the etchings on the wall moved all around her, that the beautiful, 
feral faces of the Fae turned to look as she passed. 

The only noises were her footsteps and the whispering of the torch flame. 
A chill ran down her spine, and Celaena stopped as the dark void of the 
hallway came into view. 

She was at the sealed iron door a moment later. She didn't give herself the 
luxury of reconsidering her plan as she took out her piece of chalk and traced 
two Wyrdmarks onto the door, whispering the accompanying words at the 
same time. They burned on her tongue, but as she finished speaking, she 
heard a faint, dull thud as something in the door slid open. 

She swore under her breath. The spell truly worked. She didn't want to 
think about all that implied, about how it was able to work on iron, the one 
element supposedly immune to magic. And not when there were so many 
awful spells contained in The Walking Dead--spells to summon demons, to 
raise the dead, to torture others until they begged for death ... 

With a firm tug, she yanked the door open, wincing as it whined across the 
gray stone floor. A stale, cold breeze ruffled her hair. She drew Damaris. 


After checking and double-checking that she could not be locked inside, 
she crossed the threshold. 

Her torch revealed a small staircase of about ten steps, which led down to 
another long, narrow passageway. Cobwebs and dust filled every inch of it, 
but it wasn't the neglected look of the place that made her pause. 

Rather it was the doors, the dozens of iron doors that lined both sides of 
the hallway. All as nondescript as the door behind her, all revealing nothing 
of what might be behind them. At the opposite end of the hall, another iron 
door gleamed dully in the torchlight. 

What was this place? 

She descended the stairs. It was so silent. As if the very air held its 
breath. 

She held her torch high, Damaris in her other hand, and approached the 
first iron door. It had no handle, the surface marked only by a single line. The 
door across from it had two marks. Numbers one and two. Odd numbers on 
the left, even on the right. She kept moving, igniting torch after torch, 
brushing away the curtains of cobwebs. As she walked farther down the hall, 
the numbers on the doors rose. 

Is this some sort of dungeon? 

But the floor held no traces of blood, no remnants of bones or weapons. It 
didn't even smell that bad--yjust dusty. Dry. She tried opening one of the 
doors, but it was firmly locked. All of the doors were locked. And some 
instinct told her to keep them that way. 

Her head throbbed slightly with the beginnings of a headache. 

The hallway went on and on, until she reached the door at the far end, the 
cells on either side numbered ninety-eight and ninety-nine. 

Beyond them was a final, unmarked door. She set her torch in a bracket 
beside the last door and grabbed the ring on the door to pull it open. This one 
was significantly lighter than the first, but also locked. And unlike the doors 
lining the hall, this one seemed to ask her to unlock it--as though it needed to 
be opened. So Celaena sketched the unlocking spell again, the chalk bone- 
white against the ancient metal. The door yielded without a sound. 

Perhaps these were Gavin s dungeons. From the time of Brannon. That 
would explain the Fae depictions on the staircase above. Perhaps he'd used 
these iron-gated cells to imprison the demon-soldiers of Erawan's army. Or 
the wicked things Gavin and his war band hunted down ... 


Her mouth went dry as she passed through the second door and ignited the 
torches along the way. Again, the light revealed a small set of stairs leading 
down into a hallway. Yet this one veered to the right, and was significantly 
shorter. There was nothing in the shadows--just more and more locked iron 
doors on either side. It was so, so quiet ... 

She walked until she reached the door on the other end of the hall. Sixty- 
six cells this time, all sealed shut. She unlocked the end door with the 
Wyrdmarks. 

She entered the third passageway, which also made a sharp right turn, and 
found it to be even shorter. Thirty-three cells. 

The fourth hallway veered right again, and she counted twenty-two cells. 
The slight throbbing in her head turned into a full-on pounding, but it was so 
far to her rooms, and she was here already ... 

Celaena paused before the fourth end door. 

Its a spiral. A labyrinth. Bringing you deeper and deeper inside, farther 
belowground ... 

She bit her lip but unlocked the door. Eleven cells. She increased her 
pace, and swiftly reached the fifth door. Nine cells. 

She approached the sixth door and halted. 

A different sort of chill went through her as she stared at the sixth portal. 

The center of the spiral? 

As the chalk met the iron door to form the Wyrdmarks, a voice in the back 
of her mind told her to run. And though she wanted to listen, she opened the 
door anyway. 

Her torch revealed a hallway in ruin. Parts of the walls had caved in, and 
the wooden beams were left in splinters. Cobwebs stretched between the 
broken shafts of wood, and tattered scraps of cloth, impaled upon rock and 
beam, swayed in the slight breeze. 

Death had been here. And not too long ago. If this place were as ancient 
as Gavin and Brannon, most of the cloth would be dust. 

She looked at the three cells that lined the short hallway. There was one 
more door at the end, which hung crookedly on its one remaining hinge. 
Darkness filled the void beyond. 

But it was the third cell that held her interest. 

The iron door to the third cell had been smashed, its surface dented and 
folded in upon itself. But not from the outside. 


Celaena raised Damaris before her as she faced the open cell. 

Whoever had been within had broken loose. 

A quick sweep of her torch across the threshold revealed nothing save for 
bones--piles of bones, most of them splintered beyond recognition. 

She snapped her attention back to the hallway. Nothing moved. 

Gingerly, she stepped into the cell. 

Iron chains dangled from the walls, broken off where manacles would 
have been. The dark stone was covered in white marks; dozens and dozens of 
long, deep gouges in groups of four. 

Fingernails. 

She turned around to face the broken cell door. There were countless 
marks on it. 

How could someone make such lines in iron? In stone? 

She shuddered and quickly stepped out of the cell. 

She glanced back the way she had come, which glowed with the torches 
she'd lit, and then at the dark, open space that led onward. 

You're near the center of the spiral. Just see what it is--see if it yields 
any answers. Elena said to look for clues ... 

She swung Damaris in her hand a few times--only to loosen her wrist, of 
course. Rolling her neck, she entered the gloom. 

There were no torch brackets here. The seventh portal revealed only a 
short passageway and one open door. An eighth gate. 

The walls on either side of the eighth door were damaged and claw- 
marked. Her head gave a violent throb, then quieted as she stepped nearer. 

Beyond the portal lay a spiral staircase that led upward, so high that she 
couldn't see the top. A straight ascent into darkness. 

But to where? 

The stairwell stank, and she held Damaris before her as she ascended the 
steps, taking care to avoid the fallen stones that littered the ground. 

Up and up and up she climbed, grateful for all her training. Her headache 
only grew worse, but when she reached the top, she forgot about fatigue, 
forgot about pain. 


She raised the torch. Shimmering obsidian walls surrounded her, reaching 
high, high, high--so high that she couldn't see the ceiling. She was inside 
some sort of chamber at the bottom of a tower. 


Twining through the strange stone walls, greenish veins glittered in the 
torchlight. She had seen this material before. Seen it-- 

The king 5 ring. The ring on Perrington s finger. And Cains ... 

She touched the stone, and a shock went through her, her head pounding so 
badly she gagged. The Eye of Elena gave a pulse of blue light but quickly 
died, as if the light itself had been sucked toward the stone and devoured. 

She staggered back toward the stairs. 

Gods above. What is this? 

As if in response, a boom shuddered through the tower, so loud that she 
jumped back. It echoed and echoed, turning metallic. 

She raised her gaze to the darkness above. 

"I know where I am," she whispered as the sound subsided. 

The clock tower. 


Chapter 44 


Dorian stared at the odd spiral staircase. Celaena had found the legendary 
catacombs beneath the library. Of course she had. If there were anyone in 
Erilea who could find something like that, it would be Celaena. 

He'd been just about to go to lunch when he'd seen Celaena strut into the 
library, a sword strapped across her back. Perhaps he would have let her go 
about her own business were it not for her braided hair. Celaena never tied 
back her hair unless she was fighting. And when she was about to get messy. 

It wasn't spying. And it wasn't sneaking. Dorian was merely curious. He 
followed her through long-forgotten hallways and rooms, always staying far 
behind, keeping his steps silent as Chaol and Brullo had taught him years 
ago. He'd followed until Celaena had disappeared down that staircase with a 
suspicious glance over her shoulder. 

Yes, Celaena was up to something. And so Dorian had waited. One 
minute. Five minutes. Ten minutes before following after her. To make it 
seem like an accident if their paths crossed. 

And now what did he see? Nothing but junk. Old parchment and books 
tossed around. Beyond was a second spiral staircase, lit in the same manner 
as the previous one. 

A chill went through him. He didn't like any of this. What was Celaena 
doing here? 

As if in answer, his magic screamed at him to run in the opposite direction 
--to find help. But the main library was a long way off, and by the time he 
could get there and back, something might happen. Something might already 
have happened ... 

Dorian quickly descended the staircase and found a dimly lit hallway with 
a single door left ajar, two marks written on it in chalk. When he saw the 
cell-lined hallway beyond, he froze. The iron reeked, somehow--and made 
his stomach turn. 

"Celaena?" he called down the hallway. No response. "Celaena?" 
Nothing. 

He had to tell her to get out. Whatever this place was, neither of them 
should be here. Even if the power in his blood wasn't screaming it, he would 


have known. He had to get her out. 
Dorian descended the staircase. 


Celaena half ran, half jumped down the stairs, getting away from the interior 
of the clock tower as fast as she could. Though it had been months since she 
had encountered the dead during the duel with Cain, the memory of being 
slammed into the dark wall of the tower was still too near. She could see the 
dead grinning at her, and recalled Elena's words on Samhuinn about the eight 
guardians in the clock tower and how she should stay far from them. 

Her head ached so badly that she could barely focus on the steps beneath 
her feet. 

What had been in there? This had nothing to do with Gavin, or Brannon. 
Maybe the dungeon had been built then, but this--all of this--had to be 
connected to the king. Because he had built the clock tower; built it out of-- 


Obsidian the gods forbade 
And stone they greatly feared. 


But--but the keys were supposed to be small. Not mammoth, like the 
clock tower. Not-- 

Celaena hit the bottom of the clock stairs and froze as she beheld the 
passage that contained the destroyed cell. 

The torches had been extinguished. She looked behind her, toward the 
clock tower. The darkness seemed to expand, reaching for her. She wasn't 
alone. 

Clutching her own torch, keeping her breathing steady, she crept along the 
ruined passage. Nothing--no sounds, no hint of another person in the 
passage. But... 

Halfway down, she stopped again and set down the torch. She'd marked 
all the turns, counted her steps as she came here. She knew the way in the 
dark, could find her way back blindfolded. And if she wasn't alone down 
here, then her torch was a beacon. And she was in no mood to be a target. 
She put out the torch with a grind of her heel. 

Complete darkness. 


She lifted Damaris higher, adjusting to the dark. Only it wasn't wholly 
black. A faint glow issued from her amulet--a glow that allowed her to see 
only dim shapes, as if the darkness were too strong for the Eye. The hair on 
the back of her neck rose. The only other time she'd seen the amulet glow 
like that ... Feeling along the wall with her other hand, not daring to turn 
around, she eased back toward the library. 

There was a scrape of nail against stone, and then the sound of breathing. 

It was not her own. 


It peered out from the shadows of the cell, clutching at its cloak with taloned 
hands. Food. For the first time in months. She was so warm, so teeming with 
life. It skittered out of the cell past her as she continued her blind retreat. 

Since they had locked it down here to rot, since they had gotten tired of 
playing with it, it had forgotten so many things. It had forgotten its own name, 
forgotten what it used to be. But it now knew more useful things--better 
things. How to hunt, how to feed, how to use those marks to open and close 
doors. It had paid attention during the long years; it had watched them make 
the marks. 

And once they had left, it had waited until it knew they weren't coming 
back. Until he was looking elsewhere and had taken all his other things with 
him. And then it had begun opening the doors, one after another. Some shred 
of it remained mortal enough to always seal those doors shut, to come back 
here and form the marks that again locked the doors, to keep it contained. 

But she had come here. She had learned the marks. Which meant she had 
to know--to know what had been done to it. She had to have been a part of 
it, the breaking and shattering and then the brutal rebuilding. And since she 
had come here ... 

It ducked into another shadow and waited for her to walk into its claws. 


Celaena stopped her retreat as the breathing halted. Silence. 
The blue light around her grew brighter. 
Celaena put a hand to her chest. 
The amulet flared. 


It had been stalking the little men who lived above for weeks now, 
contemplating how they would taste. But there was always that cursed light 
near them, light that burned its sensitive eyes. There was always something 
that sent it skittering back here to the comfort of the stone. 

Rats and crawling things had been its only food for too long, their blood 
and bones thin and tasteless. But this female ... it had seen her twice before. 
First with that same faint, blue light at her throat--then a second time, when 
it hadn't seen her as much as smelled her from the other side of that iron 
door. 

Upstairs, the blue light had been enough to keep it away--the blue light 
that had tasted of power. But down here, down in the shadow of the black, 
breathing stone, that light was diminished. Down here, now that it had put out 
the torches she'd ignited, there was nothing to stop it, and no one to hear her. 

It had not forgotten, even in the twisted pathways of its memory, what had 
been done to it on that stone table. 

With a dripping maw, it smiled. 


The Eye of Elena burned bright as a flame, and there was a hiss in her ear. 

Celaena whirled, striking before she could get a good look at the cloaked 
figure behind her. She glimpsed only a flash of withered skin and jagged, 
stumpy teeth before she sliced Damaris across its chest. 

It screamed--screamed like nothing she had ever heard as the ragged 
cloth ripped, revealing a bony, misshapen chest peppered with scars. It 
slammed a clawed hand into her face as it fell, its eyes gleaming from the 
light of the amulet. An animal's eyes, capable of seeing in the dark. 

The person--creature--from the hallway. From the other side of the door. 
She didn't even see where she had wounded it as she hit the ground. Blood 
rushed from her nose and filled her mouth. She staggered into a sprint back 
toward the library. 

She leapt over fallen beams and chunks of stone, letting the Eye light her 
way, barely keeping her footing as she slipped on bones. The creature 
barreled after her, tearing through the obstacles as if they were no more than 
gossamer curtains. It stood like a man, but it wasn't a man--no, that face was 
something out of a nightmare. And its strength, to be able to shove aside those 
fallen beams as though they were stalks of wheat ... 


The iron doors had been there to keep this thing in. 

And she had unlocked all of them. 

She dashed up the short stairs and through the first doorway. As she 
veered left, it caught her by the back of her tunic. The cloth tore. Celaena 
slammed into the opposite wall, ducking as it lunged for her. 

Damaris sang, and the creature roared, falling back. Black blood squirted 
from the wound across its abdomen. But she hadn't cut deep enough. 

Surging to her feet, blood running down her back from where its claws 
had punctured, Celaena drew a dagger with her other hand. 

The hood had fallen off the creature, revealing what looked like a man's 
face--looked like, but no longer was. His hair was sparse, hanging off his 
gleaming skull in clumpy strings, and his lips ... there was such scarring 
around his mouth, as though someone had ripped it open and sewed it shut, 
then ripped it open again. 

The creature pushed a gnarled hand against its abdomen, panting through 
those brown, broken teeth as it looked at her--/ooked at her with such hatred 
that she couldn't move. It was such a human expression ... 

"What are you?" She gasped, swinging Damaris as she took another step 
back. 

But it suddenly began clawing at itself, tearing at the dark robes, pulling 
out its hair, pushing against its skull, as if it would reach in and rip something 
out. And the shrieks it made, the rage and despair-- 

The creature had been in the castle hallway. 

Which meant ... 

This thing, this person--it knew how to use the Wyrdmarks, too. And with 
its unnatural strength, no mortal barrier would keep it contained. 

The creature tipped its head back, and its animal eyes settled on her again. 
Fixating. A predator anticipating the taste of its prey. 

Celaena turned and ran like hell. 


Dorian had just passed through the third door when he heard the scream of 
something not human. A series of crashing noises filled the passage, and the 
bellowing was cut short with each slam. 

"Celaena?" Dorian yelled in the direction of the commotion. 

Another slam. 


"Celaena!" 

Then-- "Dorian, run!" 

The highpitched shriek that followed Celaena's command shook the walls. 
The torches sputtered. 

Dorian drew his rapier as Celaena came flying up the stairs, blood 
leaking from her face, and slammed the iron door shut behind her. She raced 
toward him, a sword in one hand, a dagger in the other. The amulet on her 
neck glowed blue, like the hottest fire. 

Celaena was upon him in a second. The iron door burst open behind them, 
and-- 

The thing that came out was not of this earth--it couldn't be. It looked like 
something that used to be a man, but was twisted and dried and broken, with 
hunger and madness written on every protruding bone in its body. Gods. Oh, 
gods. What had she awoken? 

They sprinted down the hall, and Dorian swore as he beheld the steps up 
to the next door. The time it would take for them to climb the stairs ... 

But Celaena was fast. And months of training had made her strong. To his 
eternal humiliation, as they hit the bottom of the stairs, she grasped him by the 
collar of his tunic, half-hauling him up the steps. She hurled him into the 
hallway beyond the threshold. 

Behind them, the thing shrieked. Dorian turned in time to see its broken 
teeth glistening as it leapt up the stairs. Lightning swift, Celaena slammed the 
iron door shut in the creature's face. 

Only one more door--he could picture the landing that led back to the first 
hallway, then that spiral staircase, then the second staircase, and-- 

What then, when they reached the main library? What could they do 
against this thing? 

As Dorian saw the naked terror on Celaena's face, he knew she wondered 
the same. 


Celaena threw Dorian into the hallway and then hurled herself backward, 
slamming into the last iron door that separated the thing's lair from the rest of 
the library. She put her weight into it and saw stars as the creature barreled 
into the other side. Gods, it was strong--strong and wild and unyielding ... 


For a moment, she stumbled away, and it tried to fling open the door. But 
Celaena lunged, throwing her back against it. 

Its hand caught in the door and the creature bellowed, latching its claws 
into Celaena's shoulder as she pushed and pushed. Blood ran from her nose, 
mingling with the blood running down her shoulders. The claws dug in 
farther. 

Dorian rushed to the door, bracing his back against it. He panted, gaping 
at her. 

They had to seal the door. Even if this thing was intelligent enough to 
know the Wyrdmarks, they had to buy some time for themselves. She had to 
give Dorian enough time to get away. They would run out of strength soon, 
and the thing would break through and kill them and whoever else got in its 
path. 

There had to be a lock somewhere, some way to shut it in, to slow it down 
just for a moment ... 

"Push," she breathed to Dorian. The creature gained an inch, but Celaena 
shoved hard, drawing on the strength of her legs. It roared again, so loudly 
that she thought blood would pour from her ears. Dorian swore viciously. 

She glanced at him, not even feeling the pain of the talons embedded in 
her skin. Sweat ran down Dorian's brow as--as-- 

The metal began to heat along the edge of the door, glowing red, then 
fizzing-- 

Magic was here; magic was working right now, trying to seal the door 
against the creature. But it wasn't coming from her. 

Dorian's eyes were scrunched in concentration, his face deathly pale. 

She'd been right. Dorian did have magic. This was the information 
Yellowlegs had wanted to sell to the highest bidder, sell to the king himself. 
It was knowledge that could change everything. It could change the world. 

Dorian had magic. 

And if he didn't stop, he was going to burn himself out on the iron door. 


The door suffocated Dorian. He was in a coffin, a coffin with no air. His 
magic couldn't breathe. He couldn't breathe. 

Celaena swore as the creature gained ground. Dorian didn't even know 
what he was doing, only that he needed to seal this door. His magic had 


chosen the method. He pushed with his legs, pushed with his back, pushed his 
magic to the breaking point as he sought to weld the door. Spinning, heat, 
strangling ... 

The magic slipped from him. 

The creature pushed hard, sending Dorian staggering forward. But 
Celaena threw herself harder against the door as he regained his balance. 

Celaena's blade lay a few feet away, but what good was a sword? 

They had no hope of escaping with their lives. 

Celaena's eyes met with his, the question all too visible on her bloodied 
face: 

What have I done? 


Still gripped by the creature's talons, Celaena couldn't even move as Dorian 
made a sudden lunge for Damaris. The creature tried again to break free, and 
the prince swung, making direct contact with its wrist. Its shriek penetrated 
her bones, but the door slammed shut completely. Celaena stumbled, the 
beast's dismembered hand protruding from her shoulder, but she shoved back 
against the door as the creature again launched itself at it. 

"What the hell is it?" Dorian barked, throwing his weight back against the 
iron. 

"I don't know," Celaena breathed. Not having the luxury of a healer, she 
ripped the filthy hand from her shoulder, biting down on her scream. "It was 
down there," she panted. Another thud from behind the door. "You can't seal 
that door with magic. We need to--need to seal this another way." And find 
something that would outsmart whatever unlocking spells this creature knew 
--some way to keep it from getting out. She choked on the blood running 
from her nose into her mouth, and spat it onto the floor. "There is a book-- 
The Walking Dead. It' 1l have the answer." 

Their eyes met and held. A line stretched taut between them--a moment of 
trust, and a promise of answers from both of them. 

"Where's the book?" Dorian asked. 

"Tn the library. It ll find you. I can hold this for a few moments." 

Not needing it to make sense, Dorian bolted upstairs. He ran through stack 
after stack, his fingers reading the titles, faster and faster, knowing each 


second drained her strength. He was about to bellow his frustration when he 
ran past a table and beheld a large black volume resting upon its surface. 

The Walking Dead. 

She had been right. Why was she always right, in her own odd way? He 
grabbed the book and hurtled to the secret chamber. She had shut her eyes, 
and her teeth were red with her own blood as she gritted them. 

"Here," Dorian said. Without needing her to ask, he shoved himself into 
the door as she dropped to the floor and grabbed the book to her. Her hands 
trembled as she flipped a page, then another, and another. Her blood 
splattered onto the text. 

""To bind or to contain," 
dozens of symbols on the page. 

"This will work?" he asked. 

"I hope so," she wheezed, already moving, clutching the open book in one 
hand. "Once the spell is cast, just passing over that threshold will hold it in 
place long enough to kill it." She dipped her fingers into the wounds on her 
chest, and he could only gape as she made the first mark, and then the second, 
turning her battered body into an inkwell as she drew mark after mark around 
the door. 

"But for it to pass over the threshold," Dorian panted, "we'd have to--" 

"Open the door," she finished for him, nodding. 

He shifted so she could reach to draw above his head, their breath 
mingling. 

Celaena let out a long breath as she made the last mark, and suddenly, they 
glowed a faint blue. He held himself against the door, even as he felt the iron 
go rigid. 

"You can let go," she breathed, angling the sword. "Let go, and get the hell 
behind me." 

At least she didn't insult him by telling him to flee. 

With a final breath, he leapt away. 

The creature slammed into the door, flinging it open. 

And, just like she had said, it froze on the threshold, its animalistic eyes 
wild as its head jutted out into the hall. There was a pause then, a pause 
during which Dorian could have sworn that Celaena and the creature looked 
at each other--and its wildness calmed, just for a moment. Just for a moment, 
and then Celaena moved.

she read aloud. Dorian peered down at the 


The sword flashed in the torchlight, and there was the squish of flesh and 
crunch of bone. The neck was too thick to sever in one blow, so before 
Dorian could draw another breath, she struck again. 

The head hit the ground with a thud, black blood spraying from the 
severed neck--from the body that still stood paralyzed in the doorway. 

"Shit," Dorian breathed. "Shit." 

Celaena moved again, slamming her sword down onto the head, 
skewering it, as if she thought it could still bite. 

Dorian was still spewing a steady stream of curses as Celaena reached 
out to the bloody marks around the door and swiped a finger through one of 
them. 

The creature's headless body collapsed, the holding spell broken. 

It had barely finished falling before Celaena made four strikes: three to 
sever the emaciated torso in two, and a fourth to stab through where its heart 
would be. His bile rose up again as she angled her blade a fifth time, prying 
open the chest cavity of the creature. 

Whatever she saw made her face go even paler. Dorian didn't want to 
look. 

With grim efficiency, she kicked the too-human head through the threshold, 
sending it knocking into the withered corpse of the creature. Then she shut the 
iron door and traced a few more marks over the threshold that glowed and 
then faded. 

Celaena faced him, but Dorian looked at the door again, now sealed. 

"How long does that--that spell hold?" He almost choked on the word. 

"I don't know," she said, shaking her head. "Until I remove the marks, I 
think." 

"I don't think we can let anyone else know about this," he said carefully. 

She laughed, a bit wildly. Telling others, even Chaol, would mean 
answering difficult questions--questions that could earn them both a trip to 
the butchering block. 

"So," Celaena said, spitting blood onto the stones, "do you want to 
explain yourself first, or should 1?" 


Celaena went first, because Dorian desperately needed to change his filthy 
tunic, and talking seemed like a good idea while he stripped naked in his 


dressing room. She sat on his bed, not looking much better herself--which 
was why they'd taken the dark servants' passages back to his tower. 

"Beneath the library stretches an ancient dungeon, I think," Celaena said, 
trying to keep her voice as soft as possible. She caught a gleam of golden 
skin through the half-open door to his dressing room, and looked away. "I 
think ... I think someone kept the creature in there until it broke out of its cell. 
It's been living under the library ever since." 

No need to tell him that she was starting to believe the king had created it. 
The clock tower had been built by the king himself--so he had to know what 
it connected to. She knew that the creature had been made, because in its 
chest had been a human heart. Celaena was willing to bet that the king had 
used at least one Wyrdkey to make both tower and monster. 

"What I don't understand," Dorian said from the dressing room, "is why 
this thing can now break through the iron doors when it couldn't before." 

"Because I was an idiot and broke the spells on them when I walked 
through." 

A lie--sort of. But she didn't want to explain, couldn t explain, why the 
creature had been able to break out before and had never hurt anyone until 
now. Why it had been in the hallway that night and disappeared, why the 
librarians were all alive and unhurt. 

But perhaps the man that the creature had once been ... Perhaps he hadn't 
been entirely lost. There were so many questions now, so many things left 
unanswered. 

"And that last spell you did--on the door. It'll keep forever?" Dorian 
appeared in a new tunic and pants, still barefoot. The sight of his feet felt 
strangely intimate. 

She shrugged, fighting the urge to wipe her bloody, filthy face. He'd 
offered her his private bath, but she'd refused. That felt too intimate, too. 

"The book says it's a permanent binding spell, so I don't think anyone but 
us will be capable of getting through." 

Unless the king wants to get in and uses one of the Wyrdkeys. 

Dorian ran a hand through his hair, sitting down beside her on the bed. 
"Where did it come from?" 

"I don't know," she lied. The king's ring flashed in her memory. That 
couldn't be the Wyrdkey, though; Yellowlegs had said they were slivers of 
black rock, not--not forged into shapes. But he could have made the ring 


using the key. She understood now why Archer and his society both coveted 
and sought to destroy it. If the king could use it to make creatures ... 

If he had made more ... 

There had been so many doors. Well over two hundred, all locked. And 
both Kaltain and Nehemia had mentioned wings--wings in their dreams, 
wings flapping through the Ferian Gap. What was the king brewing there? 

"Tell me," Dorian pressed. 

"I don't know," she lied again, hating herself for it. How could she make 
him understand a truth that might shatter everything he loved? 

"That book," Dorian said. "How did you know it would help?" 

"I found it one day in the library. It seemed to ... trail me. Showed up in 
my rooms when I hadn't brought it there, reappeared in the library; it was full 
of those kinds of spells." 

"But it's not magic," Dorian said, paling. 

"Not the magic that you have. This is different. I didn't even know if that 
ee would work. Speaking of which," she said, meeting his eyes, "you have 
... Magic." 

He scanned her face, and she quelled the urge to fidget. 

"What do you want me to say?" 

"Tell me how you have magic," she breathed. "Tell me how you have it 
and the rest of the world doesn't. Tell me how you discovered it, and what 
manner of magic it is. Tell me everything." He started to shake his head, but 
she leaned forward. "You just saw me break at least a dozen of your father's 
laws. You think I'm going to turn you over to him when you could just as 
easily destroy me?" 

Dorian sighed. After a moment, he said, "A few weeks ago, I ... erupted. I 
got so mad at a council meeting that I stormed out and punched a wall. And 
somehow, the stone cracked, and then the window nearby shattered, too. 
Since then, I've been trying to figure out where it comes from, what kind of 
power it is, exactly. And how to control it. But it just ... happens. Like--" 

"Like when you used it to stop me from killing Chaol." 

His neck bobbed as he swallowed hard. 

She couldn't meet his stare as she said, "Thank you for that. If you hadn't 
stopped me, I ..." No matter what had happened between her and Chaol, no 
matter what she now felt for him, if she had killed him that night, there would 
have been no coming back from it, no recovering. In some ways ... 1n some 


ways, it might have made her into just another version of that thing in the 
library. It made her sick to even think about it. "No matter what your magic 
might be, it saved more lives than his that night." 

Dorian shifted. "I still need to learn to control it--or else it might happen 
anywhere. In front of anyone. I've gotten lucky so far, but I don't think that 
luck will last." 

"Does anyone else know? Chaol? Roland?" 

"No. Chaol doesn't know, and Roland just left with Duke Perrington. 
They're going to Morath for a few months to ... to oversee the situation in 
Eyllwe." 

It all had to be tied together: the king, the magic, Dorian's power, the 
Wyrdmarks, even the creature. The prince went to his bed and hoisted up the 
mattress, pulling out a concealed book. Not the best hiding place, but a 
valiant effort. "P ve been looking through the genealogy charts for Adarlan's 
noble families. We've hardly had any magic-users in the past few 
generations." 

There were so many things she could tell him, but if she did, it would just 
result in too many questions. So Celaena merely studied the pages he 
displayed for her, flipping through one after another. 

"Wait," she said. The puncture wounds in her shoulder gave a burst of 
pain when she lifted her hand to the book. She scanned the page he'd stopped 
on, her heart pounding as another clue about the king and his plans slipped 
into place. She let him continue on. 

"See?" Dorian said, closing the book. "I'm not quite sure where it comes 
from." 

He was still watching her, warily. She met his gaze and said quietly, "Ten 
years ago, many of the people I ... people I loved were executed for having 
magic." Pain and guilt flickered in his eyes, but she went on. "So you'll 
understand when I say that I have no desire to see anyone else die for it, even 
the son of the man who ordered those deaths." 

"Pm sorry," he said quietly. "So, what do we do now?" 

"Eat a giant meal, see a healer, take a bath. In that order." 

He snorted and playfully nudged her with a knee. 

She leaned forward, clasping her hands between her legs. ""We wait. We 
keep an eye on that door to make sure no one tries to go in, and ... just take it 
day by day." 


He took one of her hands in his own, staring toward the window. "Day by 
day." 


Chapter 45 


Celaena didn't get a meal, or take a bath, or see a healer for her shoulder. 

Instead, she hurried to the dungeon, not even looking at the guards that she 
passed. Exhaustion ripped at her, but fear kept her moving, almost sprinting 
down the stairs. 

They want to use me. They tricked me, Kaltain had said. And in Dorian's 
book of Adarlan's noble lineages, the Rompier family had been listed as one 
with a strong magical line, supposedly vanished two generations ago. 

Sometimes I think they brought me here, Kaltain had said. Not to marry 
Perrington, but for another purpose. 

Brought Kaltain here, the way Cain had been brought here. Cain, of the 
White Fang Mountains, where powerful shamans had long ruled the tribes. 

Her mouth went dry as she strode down the dungeon hallway to Kaltain's 
cell. She stopped in front, staring through the bars. 

It was empty. 

All that was left inside was Celaena's cloak, discarded in the kicked-up 
hay. As if Kaltain had struggled against whoever had come to take her. 

Celaena was at the guards' station a moment later, pointing down the hall. 
"Where is Kaltain?" Even as she said it, a memory began to clear, a memory 
hazed by days spent sedated in the dungeons. 

The guards looked at each other, then at her torn and bloody clothes, 
before one said, "The duke took her--to Morath. To be his wife." 

She stalked out of the dungeon, heading for her rooms. 

Something is coming, Kaltain had whispered. And I am to greet it. 

My headaches are worse every day, and full of all those flapping wings. 

Celaena nearly stumbled ona step. Roland has been suffering from awful 
headaches lately, Dorian told her a few days ago. And now Roland, who 
shared Dorian's Havilliard blood, had gone to Morath, too. 

Gone, or been taken? 

Celaena touched her shoulder and felt the open, bloody wounds beneath. 
The creature had been clawing at its head, as though it were in pain. And 
when it had shoved through the door, for those last few seconds it had been 


frozen in place, she had seen something human in its warped eyes-- 
something that looked so relieved, so grateful for the death she gave him. 

"Who were you?" she whispered, recalling the human heart and manlike 
body of the creature under the library. "And what did he do to you?" 

But Celaena had a feeling she already knew the answer. 

Because that was the other thing the Wyrdkeys could do, the other power 
that the Wyrdmarks controlled: life. 

They hear wings in the Ferian Gap, Nehemia had said. Our scouts do 
not come back. 

The king was twisting far worse things than mortal men. Far, far worse 
things. But what did he plan to do with them--with the creatures, with the 
people like Roland and Kaltain? 

She needed to learn how many of the Wyrdkeys he had found. 

And where the others might be. 


The next night, Celaena examined the door to the library catacombs, her ears 
straining for any hint of sound on the other side. 

Nothing. 

The bloody Wyrdmarks had turned flaky, but beneath the crust, as if 
welded onto the metal, was the dark outline of each mark. 

From high, high above, the muffled bellow of the clock tower sounded. It 
was two in the morning. How did no one know that the tower sat atop an 
ancient dungeon that served as the king's own secret chamber? 

Celaena glowered at the door in front of her. Because who would even 
think about that as a possibility? 

She knew she should go to bed, but she'd been unable to sleep for weeks 
now and saw no point in even trying anymore. It was why she'd come down 
here: to do something while sorting through her jumbled thoughts. 

She flipped the dagger in her right hand, angling it, and gave a light, 
tentative tug on the door. 

It held. She paused, listening again for any signs of life, and yanked 
harder. 

It didn't budge. 

Celaena pulled a few more times, going so far as to brace a foot against 
the wall, but the door remained sealed. When she was at last convinced that 


nothing was getting through the door--in either direction--she loosed a long 
breath. 

No one would believe her about this place--just like no one would 
believe her wild, highly unlikely story about the Wyrdkeys. 

To find the Wyrdkeys, she'd first have to solve the riddle. And then 
convince the king to let her go for a few months. Years. It would take careful 
manipulation, especially since it seemed likely that he already had a key. But 
which one? 

They hear wings ... 

Yellowlegs said that only combined could the three open the actual 
Wyrdgate, but alone each still wielded immense power. What other sorts of 
terrors could he create? If he ever got all three Wyrdkeys, what might he 
bring into Erilea to serve him? Things were already stirring on the continent; 
unrest was brewing. She had a feeling that he wouldn't tolerate it for long. 
No, it would only be a matter of time before he unleashed whatever he'd 
been creating upon them all, and crush all resistance forever. 

Celaena looked at the sealed door, her stomach turning. A half-dried pool 
of blood lay at the base of the door, so dark it looked like oil. She crouched, 
swiping a finger through the puddle. She sniffed at it, almost gagged at the 
reek, and then rubbed her finger against the pad of her thumb. It felt as oily as 
it looked. 

She got to her feet and reached into her pocket, looking for something to 
wipe off her fingers. She drew out a handful of papers. Scraps was more like 
it--bits of things that she'd carried around to study whenever she had a spare 
moment. Frowning, she shifted through them to sort out which one she could 
spare to use as a makeshift handkerchief. 

One was just a receipt for a pair of shoes, which she must have 
accidentally tucked into her pocket that morning. And another ... Celaena 
lifted that one closer. Ah! Times Rift! had been written there. She'd 
scribbled it down when she'd been trying to solve the eye riddle. When 
everything in the tomb had felt like a great secret, one giant clue. 

Some help that had been. Just another dead end. Cursing under her breath, 
she used it to wipe the grime off her fingers. The tomb still didn't make 
sense, though. What did the trees on the ceiling and the stars on the floor have 
to do with the riddle? The stars had led to the secret hole, but they could just 


as easily have been on the ceiling to do that. Why make everything 
backward? 

Would Brannon have been so foolish as to put all the answers in one 
place? 

She uncrumpled the scrap of paper, now stained with the creature's oily 
blood. Ah! Time s Rift! 

There was no inscription at Gavin's feet--only Elena's. And the words 
made little sense. 

... But what if they weren't meant to make sense? What if they were only 
just logical enough to imply one thing, but really mean another? 

Everything in the tomb was backward, rearranged, the natural order in 
reverse. To hint that things were jumbled, misarranged. So the thing that 
should have been concealed was right in the open. But, like everything else, 
its meaning was warped. 

And there was one person--one being--who could possibly tell her 
whether she was right. 


Chapter 46 


"Its an anagram," she panted as she reached the tomb. 

Mort opened an eye. "Clever, wasn't it? To hide it right where everyone 
could see?" 

Celaena eased open the door just wide enough to slip inside. The 
moonlight was strong, and her breath caught in her throat as she saw 
precisely where it fell. Trembling, she stopped at the foot of the sarcophagus 
and traced her fingers over the stone letters. ""Tell me what it means." 

He paused, long enough for her to take a breath to start yelling at him, but 
he then said, "I Am the First." 

And that was all the confirmation she needed. 

The first Wyrdkey of the three. Celaena moved around the stone body, her 
eyes on Elena's sleeping face. As she looked upon those fine features, she 
whispered the words. 


In grief, he hid one in the crown 

Of her he loved so well, 

To keep with her where she lay down 
Inside the starry cell. 


She lifted shaking fingers to the blue jewel in the center of the crown. If 
this was indeed the Wyrdkey ... what would she do with it? Would she be 
forced to destroy it? Where could she hide it so no one else would discover 
it? The questions swirled, threatening with all the difficulty they offered to 
send her running back to her rooms, but she steeled herself. She'd consider 
everything later. J will not be afraid, she told herself. 

The gem in the crown glowed in the moonlight, and she gingerly pushed 
against one side of the jewel. It didn't move. 

She pushed again, staying closer to the side, digging her nail into the slight 
crease between the gem and the stone rim. It shifted--and turned over to 
reveal a small compartment beneath. It was no larger than a coin, and no 
deeper than a knuckle's length. 


Celaena peered in. The moonlight revealed only gray stone. She stuck a 
finger inside, scraping every surface. 

There was nothing there. Not even a shard. 

A shot of cold ran down her spine. "So he truly has it," she whispered. 
"He found the key before me. And he's been using its power for his own 
agenda." 

"He was barely twenty when he found it," Mort said softly. "Strange, 
bellicose youth! Always poking about in forgotten places where he wasn't 
wanted, reading books no one his age--or any age--should read! Though," 
Mort added, "that does sound awfully like someone I know." 

"And you somehow forgot to tell me until now?" 

"I didn't know what it was then; I thought he merely took something. It 
wasn't until you read the riddle that I suspected." 

It was a good thing he was made of bronze. Otherwise she'd have 
smashed his face in. "Do you have any suspicions about what he might have 
done with it?" She turned the gem back over as she fought her rising terror. 

"How should I know? He never said anything to me, though I'll admit I 
didn't condescend to speak with him. He came back here once he was king, 
but he only poked around for a few minutes and then left. I suspect he was 
looking for the other two keys." 

"How did he discover it was here?" she asked, stepping away from the 
marble figure. 

"The same way you did, though far faster. I suppose that makes him 
cleverer than you." 

"Do you think he has the other two?" she said, eyeing the treasure along 
the far wall, the stand where Damaris was displayed. Why hadn't he taken 
Damaris, one of the greatest heirlooms of his house? 

"Tf he had the others, don't you think that our doom would have come upon 
us already?" 

"You think he doesn't have all of the keys?" she asked, beginning to sweat 
despite the cold. 

"Well, Brannon once told me that if you have all three keys, then you have 
control over the Wyrdgate. I think it's fair to assume the current king would 
have tried his hand at conquering another realm, or enslaved creatures to 
conquer the rest of ours, if he had all three." 

"Wyrd save us if that happens." 


"Wyrd?" Mort laughed. "You're pleading with the wrong force. If he 
controls the Wyrd, you're going to have to find another means of saving 
yourself. And don't you think it's too much of a coincidence that magic 
stopped as soon as he began his conquest?" 

How magic stopped ... "He used the Wyrdkeys to stifle magic. All 
magic," she added, "but his own." 

And by extension, Dorian's. 

She swore, then asked, "So you think he might also have the second 
Wyrdkey?" 

"I don't think a person could eliminate magic with only one--though I 
might be wrong. No one really knows what they're capable of." 

Celaena pressed the heels of her palms to her eyes. "Oh, gods. This was 
what Elena wanted me to learn. And now what am I supposed to do? Go hunt 
the third one down? Steal the other two from him?" 

Nehemia--Nehemia, you had to have known. You must have had a plan. 
But what were you going to do? 

The now-familiar abyss inside of her stretched wider. There was no end 
to it, that hollow ache. No end at all. If the gods had bothered to listen, she 
would have traded her life for Nehemia's. It would have been such an easy 
choice to make. Because the world didn't need an assassin with a coward's 
heart. It needed someone like Nehemia. 

But there were no gods left to bargain with; no one to offer her soul to in 
exchange for another moment with Nehemia, just one more chance to talk to 
her, to hear her voice. 

Yet ... Maybe she didn't need the gods to talk to Nehemia. 

Cain had summoned the ridderak, and he certainly hadn't possessed a 
Wyrdkey. No, Nehemia had said that there were spells to open a temporary 
portal, just long enough for something to slip through. If Cain could do that, 
and if Celaena could use the marks to freeze the catacombs creature in place 
and permanently seal a door, then couldn't marks open a portal to yet another 
realm? 

Her chest tightened. If there were other realms--realms where the dead 
dwelled, in torment or in peace--who was to say that she couldn't speak to 
Nehemia? She could do it. No matter the cost, it would only be for a moment 
--just long enough to ask Nehemia where the king was keeping the keys, or 
how to find the third, and to find out what else Nehemia might have known. 


She could do it. 

There were other things she needed to tell Nehemia, too. Words she 
needed to say, truths she needed to confess. And that good-bye--that final 
good-bye that she hadn't been allowed to make. 

Celaena took Damaris off its stand again. "Mort, how long do you think a 
portal can stay open?" 

"Whatever you are thinking, whatever you are going to do right now, stop 
it." 

But Celaena was already walking out of the tomb. He didn't understand-- 
couldn't understand. She had lost and lost and lost, been denied countless 
good-byes. But not this time--not when she could change all of that, even for 
a few minutes. This time, it would be different. 

She'd need The Walking Dead, another dagger or two, some candles, and 
space--more space than the tomb could offer. The drawings that Cain had 
made had taken up a fair amount of room. There was a large passage one 
level up in the secret tunnels, a long hallway and a set of doors she'd never 
dared open. The hallway was wide, its ceiling high: enough room to cast the 
spell. 

For her to open a portal into an Otherworld. 


Dorian knew he was dreaming. He was standing in an ancient stone chamber 
he'd never seen before, facing a tall, crowned warrior. The crown was 
familiar, somehow, but it was the man's eyes that stunned him into inaction. 
They were his own eyes--sapphire, blazing. The similarities ended there; the 
man had shoulder-length dark brown hair, an angular, almost cruel face, and 
was at least a hand taller than Dorian himself. And he carried himself like ... 
a king. 

"Prince," the man said, his golden crown gleaming. There was something 
feral in his eyes--as if the king was more accustomed to roaming the 
wilderness than walking these marble halls. "You must awaken." 

"Why?" Dorian asked, not sounding very princely at all. Strange green 
symbols were glowing on the gray stones, similar to the symbols Celaena had 
made in the library. What was this place? 

"Because a line that should never be crossed is about to be breached. It 
puts this entire castle in jeopardy--and the life of your friend." His voice 


wasn't harsh, but Dorian had a sense it could turn that way, if provoked. 
Which, judging by that ancient wildness, the arrogance and challenge in the 
king's eyes, seemed like a fairly easy to thing to do. 

Dorian said, "What are you talking about? Who are you?" 

"Don't waste time with pointless questions." Yes, this king wasn't one to 
mince words at all. "You must go to her rooms. There is a door hidden 
behind a tapestry. Take the third passage on the right. Go now, Prince, or lose 
her forever." 

And somehow, Dorian didn't think twice about the fact that Gavin, first 
King of Adarlan, had spoken to him as he awoke, yanked on his clothes, 
grabbed his sword belt, and sprinted from his tower. 


Chapter 47 


The cut on her arm throbbed, but Celaena kept her hand steady as she dipped 
her finger again into her blood and traced the Wyrdmark on the wall, copying 
the symbols in the book with perfect precision. They formed an archway--a 
door--and her blood gleamed in the light of the candles she had brought. 

It had to be perfect--each symbol had to be flawless, or else it wouldn't 
work. She kept pressing on the wound to keep it from clotting. Not everyone 
could harness the marks; no, The Walking Dead said there had to be power in 
the blood to do it. Cain had clearly had some trace of power. That must be 
why the king had rounded up Kaltain and Roland, too. He'd used the 
Wyrdkeys to suppress magic, but he must have some way of harnessing the 
innate power in someone's blood--and the Wyrdmarks must be able to 
access that power, too. 

She drew another symbol, nearly finished with the archway. 

Their power could warp things. It had warped Cain. But it had also 
allowed him to summon the ridderak and gain even more power for himself. 

Thank the Wyrd Cain was dead. 

There was one mark left to draw, the one that would bring her the person 
she so desperately needed to see, if only for a moment. It was complex, a 
weave of loops and angles. She took out her chalk and practiced on the floor 
until she got it right, then etched it in blood on the wall. Nehemia's name in 
Wyrdmark form. 

She examined the door she'd drawn and got to her feet, the book held in 
her clean hand. 

She cleared her throat and began to read the words on the page. 

She didn't know the language. Her throat burned and contracted, as if 
fighting the sounds, but she panted through it, the words making her teeth ache 
like she'd just come in from the cold and was drinking something hot. 

And then the final words were out, her eyes watering. 

No wonder this kind of power fell out of favor. 

The symbols written in her blood began to glow green, one after another, 
until the whole archway was a line of light. The stones within its borders 
darkened, darkened, darkened, then disappeared. 


The blackness within the green archway seemed to reach out for her. 

It had worked. Holy gods, it had worked. 

Was that what waited for her when she died? Nehemia had gone here? 

"Nehemia?" she whispered, her throat raw from the spell. 

There was nothing. Nothing there--just a void. 

Celaena looked at the book, then to the wall and the symbols she'd drawn. 
She'd written it correctly. The spell was right. "Nehemia?" she whispered 
toward that endless dark. 

There was no response. 

Perhaps it needed time. The book hadn't specified how long it would take; 
maybe Nehemia had to travel through whatever this realm was. 

So Celaena waited. 

The longer she stared into that endless void, the more it seemed to stare 
back. It was just like that dream, the one where she was standing on the edge 
of that ravine. 

You are nothing more than a coward. 

"Please," Celaena whispered into the dark. 

There was a sudden yelp from far, far above, and Celaena whirled toward 
the stairs at the end of the hall. Moments later, faster than should be possible, 
Fleetfoot bounded down the steps, racing for her. 

Not for her, Celaena realized as she beheld the wagging tail, the panting, 
the yip of what could only be joy. Not for her, because-- 

Celaena looked toward the portal at the same moment Fleetfoot skidded to 
a halt. 

And then everything stopped as she beheld the shimmering figure standing 
just on the other side of the portal. 

Fleetfoot lay on the ground, tail still wagging, whining softly. The edges of 
Nehemia's body rippled and blurred, fracturing with some sort of inner light. 
But her face was clear--her face was ... it was her face. Celaena sank to her 
knees. 

She felt the warmth of her tears before she realized she was crying. "I'm 
sorry," was all she could say. "I'm so sorry." 

But Nehemia remained on the other side of the portal. Fleetfoot whined 
again. "I may not cross this line," Nehemia said gently to the dog. "And 
neither may you." Her tone shifted, and Celaena knew Nehemia was now 
staring at her. "I thought you were smarter than this." 


Celaena looked up. The light radiating off the princess didn't reach 
through the glowing portal, as if there truly were some sort of line--some 
final boundary. 

"Tm sorry," Celaena whispered again. "I just wanted--" 

"There is no time for you to tell me what you long to say. I came here 
because you need to be warned. Do not open this portal again. The next time 
you do, I will not be the one who answers your call. And you will not 
survive the encounter. No one has the right to open the door to this realm, no 
matter how fierce their grief." 

She hadn't known, hadn't meant ... 

Fleetfoot pawed at the floor. "Good-bye, my dear friend," Nehemia said 
to the dog, and began walking into the blackness. 

Celaena just stood there, unable to move or think. Her throat burned with 
those pent-up words, the words that now choked the life out of her. 

"Elentiya." Nehemia paused to look back at her. The void seemed to be 
swirling, swallowing her up bit by bit. "You will not understand yet, but ... I 
knew what my fate was to be, and I embraced it. I ran toward it. Because it 
was the only way for things to begin changing, for events to be set in motion. 
But no matter what I did, Elentiya, I want you to know that in the darkness of 
the past ten years, you were one of the bright lights for me. Do not let that 
light go out." 

And before Celaena could reply, the princess was gone. 

There was nothing in the dark. As though Nehemia had never been. As 
though she'd made it all up. 

"Come back," she whispered. "Please--come back." But the darkness 
remained the same. And Nehemia was gone. 

There was a scrape of footsteps--but not from the portal. Rather, it came 
from her left. 

From Archer, who stood there gaping. "I don't believe it," he whispered. 


Chapter 48 


Celaena had Damaris drawn and leveled at Archer in a heartbeat. Fleetfoot 
growled at him, but kept back, a step behind Celaena. 

"What are you doing here?" It was inconceivable that he'd be here. How 
had he gotten in? 

"ve been tracking you for weeks,' Archer said, eyeing the dog. 
"Nehemia told me about the passages, showed me the way in. I've been 
down here almost every night since she died." 

Celaena glanced at the portal. If Nehemia had warned her not to open the 
portal, then she was certain her friend didn't want Archer seeing it, either. 
She moved to the wall, keeping well away from the blackness as she ran her 
hand over the glowing green marks, making to wipe them away. 

"What are you doing?" Archer demanded. 

Celaena pointed Damaris at him, furiously wiping at the marks. They 
didn't budge. Whatever this spell was, it was far more complex than the one 
that had sealed the library door--merely swiping away the marks wouldn't 
undo it. But Archer now stood between her and the book where she had the 
closing spell flagged. Celaena rubbed harder. It was all terribly wrong. 

"Stop!" Archer lunged, getting past her guard with unnatural ease as he 
grasped her wrist. Fleetfoot barked a ferocious warning, but a sharp whistle 
from Celaena had the dog staying well away. 

She whirled to Archer, already making to dislocate the arm that held her, 
but the green light of the portal illuminated the plane of his wrist, where the 
sleeve of his tunic had fallen back. 

A black tattoo of some snakelike creature appeared there. 

She'd seen that before. Seen it... 

Celaena raised her eyes to his face. 

Do not trust ... 

She had thought Nehemia's drawing had been of the Royal Seal--a 
slightly warped version of the wyvern. But it had actually been of this tattoo. 
Of Archer 5 tattoo. 

Do not trust Archer, she' d been trying to tell her. 


Celaena shoved back from him, drawing a dagger. She pointed both 
Damaris and the knife at him. How much had Nehemia hidden from Archer 
and his contacts? If she didn't trust them, then why had she told them all that 
she did? 

"Tell me how you learned this," Archer whispered, his eyes going back to 
the portal and the darkness beyond. "Please. Did you find the Wyrdkeys? Is 
that how you did it?" 

"What do you know of the Wyrdkeys?" she got out. 

"Where are they? Where did you find them?" 

"I don't have the keys." 

"You found the riddle, though," Archer panted. "I let you find that riddle I 
hid in Davis's office. It took us five years to find that riddle--and you must 
have solved it. I knew you'd be the one to solve it. Nehemia knew, too." 

Celaena was shaking her head. He didn't know that there had been a 
second riddle--a riddle with a map to the keys. "The king has at least one 
key. But where the other two are, I don't know." 

Archer's eyes darkened. "We suspected as much. That was why she came 
here in the first place. To learn whether he'd actually stolen them, and if so, 
how many." 

That was why Nehemia couldn't leave, she realized. Why she'd opted to 
stay here instead of returning to Eyllwe. To fight for the one thing that was 
more important than the fate of her country: the fate of the world. Of other 
worlds, too. 

"I don't have to get on a ship tomorrow. We'll tell everyone," Archer 
breathed. "We'll tell everyone he has them, and--" 

"No. If we reveal the truth, then the king will use the keys to do more 
damage than you can possibly imagine. We'll lose any chance of stealth we 
have to find the others." 

He took a step closer to her. Fleetfoot let out another warning growl, but 
kept her distance. "Then we'll find where he's keeping the key. And the 
others. And then we'll use them to overthrow him. Then we'll create a world 
of our own making." 

His voice was building into a frenzy, each word harsher than the next. 

She shook her head. "I would sooner destroy them than use their power." 

Archer chuckled. "She said the same thing. She said they should be 
destroyed--put back in the gate, if we could discover a way. But what is the 


point of finding them if we don't use them against him? Make him suffer?" 

Her stomach turned. There was more he wasn't saying, more that he knew. 
So she sighed and shook her head, beginning to pace. Archer was silent as 
she walked--silent until she halted, as if suddenly understanding. She raised 
her voice. "He should suffer for as long as possible. And so should the 
people who destroyed us--who made us into what we are: Arobynn, 
Clarisse ..." She chewed on her lip. "Nehemia could never understand that. 
She never tried to. You--you're right. They should be used." 

He studied her warily enough that she came closer and tilted her head to 
the side--contemplating his words, contemplating him. 

And Archer bought it. "That was why she left the movement. She left a 
week before she died. We knew it was a matter of time before she went to the 
king to expose us all--to use what she'd learned to grant clemency to 
Eyllwe, and to annihilate us with the same stroke. She said she'd rather have 
one all-powerful tyrant than a dozen of them." 

Celaena said with deadly calm, "She would have ruined everything for 
you. She almost ruined everything for me, too. She told me to stay away from 
the Wyrdkeys. She tried to keep me from solving the riddle." 

"Because she wanted to keep the knowledge to herself, for her own gain." 

She smiled even as she felt the world shifting beneath her. And she 
couldn't explain why, or how she began to wonder, but if it was true, she had 
to get him to admit it. She found herself saying, "You and I worked for 
everything we have--we ... we had everything taken away and used against 
us, too. Other people can't even begin to fathom the things we were forced to 
do. I think--I think that's why I was so infatuated with you when I was a girl. 
I knew, even then, that you understood. That you knew what it was like to be 
raised by people like Arobynn and Clarisse and then ... sold. You 
understood me then." She willed her eyes to gleam, her mouth to tighten as if 
she were keeping it from wobbling. Blinking furiously, she murmured, "But I 
think I finally understand you now, too." 

She reached out a hand as if to grab his, but lowered it--making her face 
tender and soft and bittersweet. "Why didn't you tell me sooner? We could 
have been working toward this for weeks. We could have tried to solve the 
riddle together. If Pd known what Nehemia was going to do, how she could 
lie to me again and again ... She betrayed me. In every possible way, Archer. 
She lied to my face, made me believe ..." Her shoulders slumped. After a 





long moment, she took a step toward him. "Nehemia was no better than 
Arobynn or Clarisse in the end. Archer, you should have told me. About 
everything. I knew it wasn't Mullison--he wasn't smart enough. If you'd told 
me, I could have taken care of it." A risk--a leap of faith. "For you ... For 
us, I would have taken care of it." 

But Archer gave her a hesitant smile. "She spent so much time 
complaining about Councilman Mullison that I knew he'd be the easiest one 
to blame. And thanks to that competition, he already had a connection to 
Grave." 

"Grave didn't recognize that you weren't Mullison?" she asked as calmly 
as she could. 

"You'd be surprised how easily men see what they want to see. A cloak, a 
mask, and some fine clothes, and he didn't think twice." 

Oh, gods. Gods. 

"So the night at the warehouse," she went on, raising an eyebrow--an 
intrigued coconspirator. "Why did you really kidnap Chaol?" 

"I had to get you away from Nehemia. And when I took that arrow for you, 
I knew you'd trust me, if only for that night. I apologize if my methods were 
... harsh. Trick of the trade, I'm afraid." 

Trust him, lose Nehemia, and lose Chaol. He had isolated her from her 
friends--the same thing she'd suspected Roland had wanted to do with 
Dorian. 

"And that threat the king received before Nehemia's death--the threat on 
her life," Celaena said, her lips curling upward. "You planted that threat, 
didn't you? To show me who my real friends are--who I can really trust." 

"It was a gamble. Just as I'm gambling now. I didn't know whether or not 
the captain would warn you. Seems I was right." 

"Why me? I'm flattered, of course, but--you're clever. Why couldn't you 
have figured the riddle out on your own?" 

Archer bowed his head. "Because I know what you are, Celaena. Arobynn 
told me one night, after you went to Endovier." She shoved the twinge of 
genuine pain and betrayal down until it couldn't distract her. "And for our 
cause to succeed, we need you. J need you. Some members of the movement 
are already starting to fight me, to question my leadership. They think my 
methods are too rough." That explained the fight she'd seen with that young 
man. He took a step toward her. "But you ... Gods, from the moment I saw 


you outside the Willows, I've known how good we'd be together. The things 
we'll accomplish ..." 

"I know," she said, looking into those green eyes, so bright in the matching 
lights of the portal. "Archer, I know." 

He didn't see the dagger coming until she'd shoved it into him. 

But he was fast--too fast--and turned just in time to have it pierce his 
shoulder instead of his heart. 

He staggered back with dazzling speed, wrenching her dagger so swiftly 
that she lost her grip on the blade and had to brace a hand on the arch of the 
portal to keep from stumbling. Her bloodied palm slapped against the stones, 
and a greenish light flared beneath her fingers. A Wyrdmark burned, then 
faded. 

Not giving herself time to look at what she'd done, she leapt for him with 
a roar, dropping Damaris to grab two more daggers. He had his own blade 
up in a moment, dancing away lightly as she sliced for him. 

"I'm going to tear you apart piece by piece," she hissed, circling him. 

But then a shudder ran through the floor, and something in the void made a 
sound. A guttural growl. 

Fleetfoot let out a low warning whine. She rushed toward Celaena, 
pushing against her shins, herding her toward the stairs. 

The void shifted, mist now swirling inside, parting long enough to reveal 
rocky, ashen ground. And then a figure emerged through the mist. 

"Nehemia?" she whispered. She'd come back--come back to help, to 
explain everything. 

But it was not Nehemia who stepped through the portal. 


Chaol couldn't sleep. He stared up at the canopy of his bed, the will he'd 
seen on Celaena's desk glaring in his mind. He couldn't stop thinking about 
it. He'd just let her kick him out of her rooms without telling her what the 
will meant to him. And maybe he deserved her hate, but--but she had to 
know that he didn't want her money. 

He had to see her. Just long enough to explain. 

He ran a finger along the scab down his cheek. 

Rushing footsteps sounded down the hall, and Chaol was already out of 
bed and half-dressed by the time someone began pounding on his door. The 


person on the other side got all of one knock in before Chaol flung open the 
door, a dagger concealed behind his back. 

He lowered the blade the second he beheld Dorian's face, shining with 
sweat, but he didn't sheath it. Not when he saw the raw panic in Dorian's 
eyes, the sword belt and scabbard dangling from the prince's clenched 
fingers. 

Chaol believed in trusting his instinct. He didn't think humans had 
survived for so long without developing some ability to tell when things 
were wrong. It wasn't magic--it was just ... gut feeling. 

And it was Chaol's instinct that told him who this was about before 
Dorian opened his mouth. 

"Where?" was all Chaol asked. 

"Her bedroom," Dorian said. 

"Tell me everything," Chaol ordered, hurrying back into his room. 

"I don't know, II think she's in trouble." 

Chaol was already shrugging on a shirt and tunic; then he stomped his feet 
into his boots before grabbing his sword. "What kind of trouble?" 

"The kind that had me coming to get you, instead of the other guards." 

That could mean anything; but Chaol knew Dorian was too smart, too 
aware of how easily words could be overheard in this castle. He sensed the 
tightening in Dorian's body a heartbeat before the prince launched into a run, 
and grabbed him by the back of his tunic. "Running," Chaol said under his 
breath, "will attract attention." 

"I already wasted too much time coming to get you," Dorian retorted, but 
he matched Chaol's brisk but calm pace. It would take five minutes to get to 
her rooms if they kept this speed. If there were no distractions. 

"Is anyone hurt?" Chaol said quietly, trying to keep his breathing even, 
keep his focus. 

"T don't know," Dorian said. 

"You have to give me more than that," Chaol snapped. The leash on his 
temper strained with each step. 

"I had a dream," Dorian said, so soft only he could hear. "I was warned 
that she was in danger--that she was a danger to herself." 

Chaol almost stopped, but Dorian had said it with such conviction. 

"You think I wanted to come get you?" Dorian said, not looking at him. 


Chaol didn't reply but hurried his steps as much as he could without 
attracting undue attention from the servants and guards still on duty. He could 
feel his heart hammering through every inch of his body by the time they got 
to her suite doors. Chaol didn't bother knocking and nearly took the front 
door off its hinges as he burst through, Dorian on his heels. 

He was at her bedroom door in an instant, and didn't bother knocking on 
it, either. But the handle didn't move. The door was locked. He shoved into it 
again. 

"Celaena?" Her name was more of a growl that rippled out of him. No 
answer. He fought his rising panic, even as he drew a dagger, even as he 
listened for any signs of trouble. "Celaena. " 

Nothing. 

Chaol waited all of a second before he slammed his shoulder into the 
door. Once. Twice. The lock snapped. The door burst open, revealing her 
empty bedroom. 

"Holy gods," Dorian whispered. 

The tapestry on the wall had been folded back to reveal an open door--a 
secret, stone door that opened into a dark passage. 

It was how she'd gotten out to kill Grave. 

Dorian drew his sword from the scabbard. "In my dream, I was told I 
would find this door." 

The prince stepped forward, but Chaol stopped him with an arm. He'd 
think about Dorian and his clairvoyant dreams later--much later. ""You're not 
going down there." 

Dorian's eyes flashed. "Like hell I'm not." 

As if in answer, a guttural, bone-grinding growl sounded from within. And 
then a scream--a human scream, followed by a highpitched bark. 

Chaol was running for the passage before he could think. 

It was pitch-black, and Chaol almost tumbled down the stairs, but Dorian, 
close behind, grabbed a candle. 

"Stay upstairs!' Chaol ordered, still charging down. If he'd had time, he 
would have locked Dorian in the closet rather than risk bringing the Crown 
Prince into danger, but ... What the hell had that growl been? The bark he 
knew--the bark was Fleetfoot. And if Fleetfoot was down there ... 

Dorian kept following him. "I was sent here," he said. Chaol took the 
stairs by twos and threes, hardly hearing the prince's words. Had that scream 


been hers? It had sounded male. But who else could be down here with her? 

Blue light flashed from the bottom of the stairs. What was that? 

A roar shook the ancient stones. That was not human, nor was it Fleetfoot. 
But what-- 

They had never found the creature that had been killing the champions. 
The murders had just stopped. But the damage he'd seen to those corpses ... 
No, Celaena had to be alive. 

Please, he begged any gods who would listen. 

Chaol leapt onto the landing and found three doorways. The blue light had 
flashed from the right. They ran. 

How had such a massive cavern of chambers been forgotten? And how 
long had she known about them? 

He flew down a spiral staircase. And then a new, greenish light began 
shining steadily, and he turned onto a landing to see-- 

He didn't know where to look first--at the long hallway, where one wall 
glowed with an arch of green symbols, or at the ... the world that showed 
through the arch, depicting a land of mist and rock. 

At Archer, cowering against the opposite wall, chanting strange words 
from a book held in his hands. 

At Celaena, prostrate on the floor. 

Or at the monster: a tall, sinewy thing, but definitely not human. Not with 
those unnaturally long fingers tipped with claws, white skin that looked like 
crumpled paper, a distended jaw that revealed fishlike teeth, and those eyes 
--milky and tinged with blue. 

And there was Fleetfoot, hackles raised and fangs bared, refusing to let 
the demon anywhere near Celaena, even as the half-grown pup limped, even 
as the blood pooled from the wound in her right hind leg. 

Chaol had all of two heartbeats to size up the monster, to take in every 
detail, to mark his surroundings. "Go," he snarled at Dorian before launching 
himself at the creature. 


Chapter 49 


She didn't remember anything after the first two swings of her sword, only 
that she'd suddenly seen Fleetfoot come flying at the creature. The sight had 
distracted her enough for the demon to get past her guard, its long, white 
fingers grabbing her by the hair and slamming her head into the wall. 

Then darkness. 

She wondered whether she'd died and awoken in hell as she opened her 
eyes to a pulsing headache--and the sight of Chaol, circling the pale demon, 
blood dripping from both of them. And then there were cool hands on her 
head, on her neck, and Dorian crouching in front of her as he said, "Celaena." 

She struggled to her feet, her head aching even more. She had to help 
Chaol. Had to-- 

She heard a rip of clothing and a yelp of pain, and she looked at Chaol in 
time to see him grasp the cut on his shoulder, inflicted by those filthy, jagged 
nails. The creature roared, its overlong jaw gleaming with saliva, and it 
lunged again for the captain. 

Celaena tried to move, but she wasn't fast enough. 

But Dorian was. 

Something invisible slammed into the creature, sending it flying into the 
wall with a crunch. Gods. Dorian didn't just have magic--he had raw magic. 
The rarest, and deadliest, kind. Sheer undiluted power, capable of being 
shaped into whatever form the wielder desired. 

The creature crumpled but instantly got up, whirling toward her and 
Dorian. The prince just stood there, hand outstretched. 

The milky-blue eyes were ravenous now. 

Through the portal Celaena heard the rocky earth crunching beneath more 
pairs of bare, pale feet. Archer's chanting grew louder. 

Chaol attacked the thing again. It surged toward him just before his sword 
struck, swiping with those long fingers, forcing the captain to dart back. 

She grabbed Dorian. "We have to close it. The portal should close on its 
own eventually, but--but the longer it's open, the greater the threat of more 
coming through before it does." 

"How?" 


"I--I don't know, I ..." Her head spun so badly her knees wobbled. But 
she turned to Archer, who stood across the hall, separated from them by the 
pacing creature. "Give me the book." 

Chaol wounded the demon across its abdomen with a sure, deft stroke, but 
it didn't slow down. Even from a few feet away, the tang of the dark blood 
reached her nose. 

Celaena watched Archer take it all in, his eyes wide, panicked beyond 
reason. And then he sprinted down the hall, taking with him the book--and 
any hope of shutting the portal. 


Dorian couldn't move fast enough to stop the handsome man from fleeing 
with the book in his hands, and didn't dare, with that demon between them. 
Celaena, her forehead bleeding, made a lunge for him, but the man was too 
fast. Her eyes kept darting to Chaol, who was keeping the thing distracted. 
Dorian knew without being told that she didn't want to leave the captain. 

"PII go--" Dorian began. 

"No. He's dangerous, and these tunnels are a labyrinth," she panted. Chaol 
and the creature circled each other, the thing slowly backing toward the 
portal entrance. "I can't close it without that book," she moaned. "There are 
more books upstairs, but I--" 

"Then we flee," Dorian breathed, grabbing her by the elbow. "We flee and 
try to get to those books." 

He dragged her with him, not daring to take his eyes off Chaol or the 
creature. She swayed in his grasp. The wound to her head must be as bad as 
it looked. Something was glowing at her throat: the amulet she'd told him 
was just a "cheap replica," shining like a tiny blue star. 

"Go," Chaol told them, staring down the thing in front of him. "Now." 

She stumbled, tugging toward Chaol, but Dorian pulled her back. 

"No," she got out, but the wound to her head made her sag in Dorian's 
grip. As if realizing that she'd be a hindrance to Chaol, she stopped fighting 
Dorian as he hauled her toward the stairs. 





Chaol knew he couldn't win this fight. His best option was to flee with them, 
to guard the way until they could get to that stone door far, far above and lock 


the creature down here. But he wasn't sure he'd even make it to the stairs. 
The creature thwarted his attacks so easily it seemed to have an uncanny 
intelligence. 

At least Celaena and Dorian had reached the stairs. He could accept his 
end if it meant they could escape. He could embrace the darkness when it 
came. 

The creature paused just long enough for Chaol to gain a few more feet of 
distance. He backed toward the bottom step. 

But then she started shouting--the same word again and again as Dorian 
tried to keep dragging her up the stairs. 

Fleetfoot. 

Chaol looked. In a dark shadow by the wall, Fleetfoot had been left 
behind, her leg too injured to run. 

The creature looked, too. 

And there was nothing he could do, absolutely nothing, as the creature 
whirled, grabbed Fleetfoot by her injured hind leg, and dragged her through 
the portal with it. 

There was nothing he could do, he realized, except run. 

Celaena's scream was still echoing through the passageway as Chaol 
leapt off the stairs and hurtled through the misty portal after Fleetfoot. 


If she had thought she'd known fear and pain before, it was nothing compared 
to what went through her when Chaol ran through the portal after Fleetfoot. 

Dorian didn't see her coming as she whirled, slamming his head into the 
stone wall hard enough that he crumpled to the steps, freeing her from his 
grip. 

But she didn't care about Dorian, didn't care about anything except 
Fleetfoot and Chaol as she sprinted down those few stairs and across the 
hall. She had to get them out, get them back before the portal shut forever. 

She was through in a heartbeat. 

And when she saw Chaol shielding Fleetfoot with nothing but his bare 
hands, his discarded sword snapped in two by the demon who hovered over 
them, she didn't think twice before she unleashed the monster inside herself. 


From the corner of his eye, Chaol saw her coming, the ancient sword in her 
hands and her face set with feral rage. 

The moment she burst through the portal, something changed. It was like a 
fog vanished from her face, her features sharpening, her steps becoming 
longer and more graceful. And then her ears--her ears shifted into delicate 
points. 

The creature, sensing it was about to lose its prey, made a final lunge for 
Chaol. 

It was blasted away by a wall of blue flame. 

The fire vanished to reveal the creature slamming into the ground, flipping 
again and again. It was on its feet before it finished rolling, whirling toward 
Celaena in the same move. 

She was between them now, sword raised. She roared, revealing 
elongated canines, and the sound was unlike anything he'd ever heard. There 
was nothing human in it. 

Because she wasn't human, Chaol realized, gaping up at her from where 
he still crouched over Fleetfoot. 

No--she wasn't human at all. 

Celaena was Fae. 


Chapter 50 


She knew the shift had happened, because it hurt like hell. A flash of blinding 
pain as her features ripped free of the hold that hid them. The demon lunged, 
and she plummeted into the well of power that was suddenly overflowing 
inside of her. 

Magic, savage and unforgiving, erupted out of her, punching into the 
creature and sending it flying. Flame--years ago, her power had always 
manifested as some form of fire. 

She could smell everything, see everything. Her heightened senses pulled 
her attention every which way, telling her that this world was wrong, and she 
needed to get out now. 

But she wouldn't get out, not until Chaol and Fleetfoot made it to safety. 

The creature stopped rolling, on its feet in an instant, and Celaena put 
herself between it and Chaol. The demon sniffed at her, sinking onto its 
haunches. 

She lifted Damaris and bellowed her challenge. 

From far off in the mist, roars answered. One of them came from the thing 
in front of her. 

She looked at Chaol, still crouched over Fleetfoot, and bared her teeth, 
canines glistening in the gray light. 

Chaol was staring up at her. She could smell his terror and his awe. Smell 
his blood, so human and ordinary. The magic welled up more and more and 
more, uncontrollable and ancient and burning. 

"Run," she snarled, more a plea than a command, because the magic was 
a living thing, and it wanted out, and she was just as likely to hurt him as she 
was to hurt the creature. Because that portal might close at any moment and 
seal them here forever. 

She didn't wait to see what Chaol did. The creature rushed for her, a blur 
of withered white flesh. She ran toward it, flinging her immortal power like a 
phantom punch. It shot out in a blue burst of wildfire, but the creature dodged 
it, and the next blow and the next. 

Celaena swung Damaris, and the creature ducked before jumping back a 
few paces. The roars in the distance were getting closer. 


Crunching rock sounded behind her, and she knew Chaol was making for 
the portal. 

The demon began pacing. Then the crunching stopped. That meant Chaol 
was in the passageway again; he must have carried Fleetfoot with him. He 
was Safe. Safe. 

This thing was too smart, too fast--and too strong, despite its gangly 
limbs. 

And if others were coming--if more got through the portal before it 
closed ... 

Her magic was building again, the spring deeper now. Celaena gauged the 
distance between them as she backed toward the portal. 

She had little control over the power, but she did have a sword--a sacred 
sword made by the Fae, capable of withstanding magic. A conduit. 

Not giving herself time to think it through, she threw all her raw power 
into the golden sword. Its blade glowed red-hot, its edges crackling with 
lightning. 

The creature tensed, as if sensing what she was about to do as she lifted 
the sword over her head. With a battle cry that shattered through the mists, 
Celaena plunged Damaris into the earth. 

The ground cracked toward the demon, a burning web of lines and 
fissures. 

And then the ground between them began to collapse, foot by foot, until 
the creature was sprinting away. Soon there was just a small lip of land 
surrounding Celaena, backed by the open portal, and an evergrowing chasm 
before her. 

She wrenched Damaris from the broken earth. She knew she had to get out 
--now. But before she could move, before she could get to the portal, the 
magic rippled, so violently that she sagged to her knees. Pain flashed, and 
she shifted back into her clumsy, frail mortal body. 

And then there were strong hands under her shoulders, hands she knew so 
well, dragging her back through the portal and into Erilea, where her magic 
was snuffed out like a candle. 


Dorian came to just in time to see Chaol hauling Celaena back through the 
portal. She was conscious, but was a dead weight in the captain's arms as he 


dragged her across the ground. Once they were over the border, he dropped 
her as though she were made of flame, and Celaena lay panting on the stones. 

What had happened? There had been a land of rock beyond the portal, and 
now ... now there was nothing but a small ledge and a massive crater. The 
pale creature was gone. 

Celaena pushed herself up onto her elbows, her limbs wobbling. Dorian's 
head ached, but he managed to walk to them. He'd been dragging her one 
moment, and then--then she'd knocked him out. Why? 

"Close it,' Chaol was saying to her, his face so white that the blood 
splattered on it stood out even more starkly. "Close it. " 

"I can't," Celaena breathed. Dorian gripped the wall to keep himself from 
falling to his knees from the ache in his head. He made it to where they were 
positioned in front of the portal, Fleetfoot nuzzling Celaena. 

"They're going to keep coming through," Chaol panted. Something was 
wrong, Dorian realized--something was wrong between them. Chaol wasn't 
touching her, wasn't helping her up. 

Beyond the crater inside the portal, the roaring was growing louder. No 
doubt those things would find some way to get through. 

"Pm drained; I don't have anything left to close this gate ..." Celaena 
winced, then lifted her eyes to Dorian's. "But you do." 


From the corner of her eye, Celaena saw Chaol whirl to face Dorian. She 
staggered to her feet. Fleetfoot had again put herself between Celaena and the 
portal, snarling softly. "Help me,' she whispered to the prince, some 
semblance of energy returning. 

Dorian didn't look at Chaol. He stepped forward. "What must I do?" 

"I need your blood. The rest I can do. At least, I hope I can." Chaol 
started to object, and Celaena gave him a faint, bitter smile. "Don't worry. 
Only a cut on the arm." 

Sheathing his sword, Dorian rolled up the sleeve of his shirt and drew a 
dagger. Blood welled from the cut, quick and bright. 

Chaol growled, "How did you learn to open a portal?" 

"I found a book," she said. It was the truth. "I wanted to speak to 
Nehemia." 

Silence fell--pitying, horrifying silence. 


But then she added, "IJ--I think I accidentally changed a symbol." She 
pointed to the Wyrdmark she'd smeared, the one that had rearranged itself. "It 
went to the wrong place. But this might close the door--if we're lucky." 

What she didn't tell them was that there was a good chance it wouldn't 
work. But because there were no other books in her rooms, and because 
Archer had taken The Walking Dead with him, all she had left was that 
sealing spell she'd used on the door in the library. And there was no way-- 
no way in hell--she was going to abandon this open portal, or leave one of 
them to guard it. The portal would eventually close on its own, but she didn't 
know when. More of those things could creep through at any time. So she'd 
try this, because it was her only option. She'd figure out something else if it 
didn't work. 

It will work, she told herself. 

Dorian put a warm, reassuring hand on her back as she dipped her fingers 
into his blood. She hadn't realized how freezing her hands were until the heat 
of his blood warmed her fingertips. One by one, she drew the sealing marks 
over the green-glowing symbols. Dorian never let go of her--only stepped 
even closer when she swayed. Chaol said nothing. 

Her knees buckled, but she finished covering the symbols with Dorian's 
blood. A lingering roar echoed through the damned world as the final symbol 
flared, the mists and rock and ravine fading into black, then into familiar 
Stone. 

Celaena kept her breathing steady, throwing all her focus into that. If she 
could keep breathing, she wouldn't fall apart. 

Dorian lowered his arm and loosed a sigh, finally letting go of her. 

"Let's go," Chaol ordered, scooping up Fleetfoot, who whined in pain and 
gave him a warning growl. 

"I think we all need a drink," Dorian said quietly. "And an explanation." 

But Celaena looked down the hall, to the stairwell where Archer had fled. 
Had it only been minutes ago? It had felt like a lifetime. 

But if it had only been minutes ... Her breathing stumbled. She had 
discovered only one way out of the castle, and she was certain that was 
where Archer had gone. After what he'd done to Nehemia, after taking the 
book and abandoning them to that creature ... Exhaustion was replaced by 
familiar anger--anger that burned through everything, just as Archer had 
destroyed what she loved. 


Chaol stepped into her path. "Don't you even think--" 
Panting, she sheathed Damaris. "Hes mine." 
Before Chaol could grab her, she hurtled down the stairs. 


Chapter 51 


Though Celaena's Fae senses were extinguished, she could swear she still 
smelled Archer's cologne as she moved toward the sewer tunnel, still 
smelled the blood on him. 

He had destroyed everything. He'd had Nehemia assassinated, had 
manipulated them both, had used Nehemia's death to drive a wedge between 
her and Chaol, all in the name of power and revenge ... 

She would take him apart. Slowly. 

I know what you are, he'd said. She didn't know what Arobynn had told 
him about her heritage, but Archer had no idea what sort of darkness lurked 
inside her, or what sort of monster she was willing to become in order to 
make things right. 

Ahead of her, she could hear muffled curses and banging against metal. By 
the time she reached the sewer tunnel, she knew what had happened. The 
grate had slid shut, and none of Archer's attempts to open it had worked. 
Perhaps the gods did listen sometimes. Celaena smiled, drawing both of her 
daggers. 

She walked through the archway, but the passage was empty on either side 
of the small river. She stepped farther onto the walkway, peering into the 
water, wondering if he'd tried to swim deep enough to go under the grate. 

She sensed him a heartbeat before he attacked from behind. 

She met his sword with both her daggers raised over her head, darting 
back to give herself enough time to assess. Archer had trained with the 
assassins--and from the way he wielded his blade, coming after her again 
and again, she knew he'd kept up those lessons. 

She was exhausted. Archer was at full strength, and his blows made her 
arms quake. 

He swiped for her throat, but she ducked, slicing for his side. Swift as 
lightning, he leapt to avoid her gutting him. 

"I killed her for our sake," Archer panted as she scanned for any 
weakness, any opening. "She would have ruined us. And now that you can 
open portals without the keys, think of what we could do. Think, Celaena. 


Her death was a worthy sacrifice to keep her from destroying the cause. We 
must rise up against the king." 

She lunged, feinting left, but he caught the attack. She growled, "I would 
rather live in his shadow than in a world where men like you rule. And when 
I'm done with you, I'm going to find all your friends and return the favor." 

"They don't know anything. They don't know what I know," he said, 
dancing past all her attacks with maddening ease. "Nehemia was hiding 
something else about you. She didn't want you involved, and I thought it was 
just because she didn't want to share you with us. But now I wonder why, 
exactly. What more did she know?" 

Celaena laughed softly. "You're a fool if you think P1 help you." 

"Oh, once my men start working on you, you'll soon change your mind. 
Rourke Farran was a client of mine--before he was killed, that is. You 
remember Farran, don't you? He had a special love for pain. He told me that 
torturing Sam Cortland was the most fun he ever had." 

She could hardly see through the bloodlust that seized her in that moment, 
hardly remember her own name. 

Archer feinted toward the river to get her to return to the wall--where she 
would impale herself on his blade. But Celaena knew that move, too--knew 
it because she herself had taught it to him all those years ago. So as he struck, 
she ducked past his guard and rammed the pommel of her dagger up into his 
jaw. 

He dropped like a stone, sword clattering, and she was upon him before 
he'd finished falling, her dagger at his throat. 

"Please," he whispered hoarsely. 

She pushed the edge of the blade into his skin, wondering how she could 
make this last without killing him too quickly. 

"Please," he begged, chest heaving. "I'm doing it for our freedom. Our 
freedom. We're on the same side in the end." 

One flick of the wrist, and she could slit his throat. Or she could disable 
him the way she'd disabled Grave. She could give him the injuries Grave 
had given Nehemia. She smiled. 

"You're not a murderer," he whispered. 

"Oh, I am," she purred, torchlight dancing on the dagger as she considered 
what to do with him. 

"Nehemia wouldn't want this. She wouldn't want you to do this." 


And though she knew she shouldn't listen, the words struck home. 

Dont let that light go out. 

The darkness that thrived in her soul had no light left. No light--save for a 
kernel, a faint flicker that grew smaller by the day. Wherever she was now, 
Nehemia knew how small the flame had become. 

Dont let that light go out. 

Celaena felt the tension go out of her body, but she kept her dagger on 
Archer's throat until she was on her feet. 

"Youre leaving Rifthold tonight," she told him. "You and all of your 
friends." 

"Thank you," Archer breathed, standing. 

"If I find out you're still in the city at dawn," she said, putting her back to 
him as she stalked toward the tunnel stairs, "Pll kill you." Enough. It was 
enough. 

"Thank you," Archer said again. 

She kept walking, listening for any sign of him moving to attack her back. 

"I knew you were a good woman," he said. 

Celaena halted. Turned. 

There was a hint of triumph in his eyes. He thought he'd won. 
Manipulated her again. One foot after another, she walked back toward him 
with predatory calmness. 

She stopped, close enough to kiss him. He gave her a wary smile. 

"No, Pm not," she said. Then she moved, too fast for him to stand a 
chance. 

Archer's eyes went wide as she slid the dagger home, jamming it up into 
his heart. 

He sagged in her arms. She brought her mouth to his ear, holding him 
upright with one hand and twisting the dagger with the other as she 
whispered, "But Nehemia was." 


Chapter 52 


Chaol watched blood bubble out of Archer's lips as Celaena let him slump to 
the stone floor. She stared down at the body, her final words to him hovering 
in the air, running claws over Chaol's already chilled skin. She closed her 
eyes, tilting her head back as she took a long breath--as if she were 
embracing the death before her, and the stain it left as payment for her 
vengeance. 

He had arrived in time to hear Archer beg for his life--and utter the 
words that had been his last mistake. Chaol shifted his boot against the step 
to warn her that he was there. How much of her Fae senses did she retain 
when she looked like a human? 

Archer's blood spread across the dark stones, and Celaena opened her 
eyes as she slowly turned to Chaol. The blood had soaked the ends of her 
hair, turning them a brilliant red. And her eyes ... There was nothing there, as 
though she'd been hollowed out. For a heartbeat, he wondered if she would 
kill him, too--just for being there, for seeing the dark truth of her. 

She blinked, and the killing calm in her eyes vanished, replaced only by 
bone-deep weariness and sorrow. An invisible burden that he couldn't begin 
to imagine made her shoulders slump. She picked up the black book that 
Archer had dropped on the damp stones, but let it dangle from her fingers as 
if it were a piece of dirty clothing. 

"T owe you an explanation," was all she said. 


Celaena refused to let the healer look at her until Fleetfoot's leg had been 
fixed. It was only a long scratch, but it was deep. Celaena had held 
Fleetfoot's head in her arms as the thrashing dog was forced to swallow 
water laced with a sedative. Dorian helped as best he could while the healer 
worked on the dog lying unconscious on Celaena's dining-room table. Chaol 
leaned against the wall of the room, arms crossed over his chest. He'd said 
nothing to Dorian since they'd gone down into the passageway. 

The young, brown-haired healer didn't ask any questions, either. Once 
Fleetfoot was patched up and moved to Celaena's bed, Dorian insisted 


Celaena get her head looked at. But Celaena waved him off and told the 
healer that if she didn't inspect the Crown Prince first, she'd report her to the 
king. Scowling, Dorian let the young woman clean the small wound on his 
temple, received when Celaena had knocked him out cold. Considering how 
bloody Celaena and Chaol were, he felt utterly ridiculous, even if his head 
still pounded. 

The healer finished with him, giving him a timid, slightly concerned smile. 
And when it was time to decide who should be looked at next, the glaring 
contest between Chaol and Celaena was one for the ages. 

At last, Chaol just shook his head and slumped into the seat that Dorian 
had recently vacated. He had blood everywhere, and ended up peeling off his 
tunic and shirt so the healer could cleanse his minor wounds. Despite the 
scratches and cuts, the abrasions on his hands and knees, the healer still 
asked no questions, her pretty face an unreadable, professional mask. 

Celaena turned to Dorian, her voice quiet. "P1 come to your rooms when 
I'm done here." 

From the corner of his eye, he sensed Chaol stiffening, and Dorian bit 
down on his surge of jealousy as he realized he was being dismissed. The 
captain was making a good show of not looking at them. What had happened 
during the time he'd blacked out? And what had happened when she'd gone 
to kill Archer? 

"Fine," Dorian said, and thanked the healer for her help. 

At least he had time now to piece himself together, to sort through all that 
had happened in the last few hours. And to plan how to explain his magic to 
Chaol. 

But even as he walked out of the dining room, part of him realized that his 
magic--that he--was the least of their concerns. Because even from that first 
day in Endovier, this had always been about them. 


Celaena didn't need a healer to look at her head. When the magic had taken 
her over, it had somehow healed everything. All that was left of her wounds 
now were bloodstains and torn clothing. And exhaustion--utter exhaustion. 
"Pm taking a bath," she told Chaol, who still sat shirtless under the 
healer's ministrations. 
She needed to wash Archer's blood off her. 


She shucked off her clothing and bathed, scrubbing herself until her skin 
hurt, washing her hair twice. When she emerged, she slipped into a clean 
tunic and pants, and just as she finished combing out her dripping hair, Chaol 
walked into her bedroom and sat at the chair before her desk. The healer 
gone, he'd put his shirt back on, and she could see the white bandages 
peeking through the rips in the dark cloth. 

Celaena checked on Fleetfoot, who was still unconscious on the bed, and 
then walked to the balcony doors. She studied the night sky for a long 
moment, seeking out a familiar constellation--the Stag, the Lord of the North. 
She took a long breath. 

"My great-grandmother was Fae," she said. "And even though my mother 
couldn't switch into an animal form the way the Fae can, I somehow 
inherited the ability to shift. Between my Fae form and my human form." 

"And you can't shift anymore?" 

She looked over her shoulder at him. "When magic stopped ten years ago, 
I lost my ability. It's what saved my life, I think. As a child, when I was 
scared or upset or had tantrums, I couldn't control the shift. I was learning to 
master it, but I would have given myself away at some point." 

"But in that--that other world, you could ..." 

She turned to face him, seeing the haunted gleam in his eyes. "Yes. In that 
world, magic, or something like it, still exists. And it is just as awful and 
overwhelming as I remembered." She eased onto the edge of her bed, the 
distance between them feeling like leagues. "I had no control over it--over 
the shift, or the magic, or myself. I was as likely to hurt you as I was to hurt 
that creature." She closed her eyes, her hands shaking a bit. 

"So you did open a portal to another world. How?" 

"All those books ve been reading on the Wyrdmarks--they had spells to 
open temporary portals." And then she explained about finding the passage 
on Samhuinn, and the tomb and Elena's command to become the Champion, 
and what Cain had been doing and how she had killed him, and how tonight 
she had wanted to open a portal to see Nehemia. She left out the Wyrdkeys, 
the king, and what she suspected he might be doing with Kaltain and Roland. 

When she finished, Chaol said, "I would say you're insane, except I have 
the blood of that creature on me, and went into that world myself." 

"If anyone knew--not just about the spells to open portals, but about what 
I am," she said wearily, "you understand that I would be executed." 


His eyes flashed. "I'm not going to tell anyone. I swear it." 

She bit her lip, nodding, and walked back to the window. "Archer told me 
that he was the one who had Nehemia assassinated, because she was a threat 
to his control over the group. He posed as Councilman Mullison and hired 
Grave. He kidnapped you to lure me away. He planted that anonymous threat 
against her life, too. Because he wanted me to blame you for her death." 

Chaol swore, but she kept gazing out the window, kept looking at that 
constellation. 

"But even though I know you're not responsible," she said softly, "I still 
... She found his face full of anguish. 

"You still can't trust me," he finished. 

She nodded. In this, she knew Archer had won, and hated him for it. 
"When I look at you," she whispered, "all I want to do is touch you. But what 
happened that night ... I don't know if I can ever forget it." The deepest cut 
on his cheek had scabbed, and she knew it would scar. "For my part, I am 
sorry for what I did to you." 

He stood, wincing at his wounds, and walked over to her. "We both made 
mistakes," he said in that voice that made her heart stumble. 

She found the nerve to turn to him, gazing up into his face. "How can you 
still look at me like that when you know what I truly am?" 

His fingers grazed her cheeks, warming her chilled skin. "Fae, assassin-- 
no matter what you are, I--" 

"Don't." She stepped back. "Don't say it." 

She couldn't give him everything again--not now. It wouldn't be fair to 
either of them. Even if she ever learned to forgive him for picking the king 
over Nehemia, her journey to find the Wyrdkeys would require her to go far 
away, to a place where she would never ask him to follow. 

"I need to prepare Archer's body to present to the king," she got out. 
Before he could say anything else, she picked up Damaris from where she'd 
dropped it by the door and vanished into the passage. 

She waited until she was deep inside before she let the tears start flowing. 


Chaol stared at where she had gone and wondered if he should follow her 
into that ancient darkness. But he thought of all that she'd told him, all the 
secrets she'd revealed, and knew he needed time to comprehend it all. 


He could tell that she had left out information. She'd told him only the 
vaguest details; and then there was the matter of her Fae heritage. He'd never 
heard of anyone inheriting their powers in such a throwback way, but then 
again, no one spoke of the Fae nowadays. It explained how she knew the 
ancient dirges. 

With a gentle pat on Fleetfoot's head, he left the room. The halls were 
empty and silent. 

And Dorian--she had acted like Dorian had some power, too. There had 
been the moment when the creature was blasted away by an invisible wall ... 
But it was impossible for Dorian to have power. How could he, when 
Celaena's own--own magic had disappeared as soon as she returned to this 
world? 

Celaena was Fae, and heir to a power she couldn't control. Even if she 
couldn't shift, if anyone ever discovered what she was... 

It explained why she was so terrified of the king, why she never said 
anything about where she'd come from, or what she'd been through. And 
living here ... this was the most dangerous place for her--or any Fae--to be. 

If someone found out what she was, they could use that information against 
her, or have her killed. And there would be nothing he could do to save her. 
No lie he could tell, no strings he could pull. How long before someone else 
went digging into her past? How long before someone decided to go right to 
Arobynn Hamel and torture him for the truth? 

Chaol's feet knew where he was going long before he'd made the choice, 
formed the plan. Minutes later, he found himself knocking on a wooden door. 

His father's eyes were bleary with sleep, and they narrowed as they saw 
him. "Do you know what time it is?" 

He didn't, and he didn't care. Chaol shouldered his way into the room and 
shut the door, scanning the dimness for any other people. "I have a favor to 
ask you, but before I do, promise you won't ask any questions." 

His father gave him a slightly bemused look, then crossed his arms. "No 
questions. Make your request." 

Beyond the window, the sky was beginning to lighten into a softer shade 
of black. "I think that we should send the King's Champion to Wendlyn to 
dispatch the royal family." 

His father's brows rose. Chaol went on. "We've been at war with them 
for two years, and have yet to break past their naval defenses. But if the king 


and his son are eliminated, we might stand a chance of getting through in the 
ensuing chaos. Especially if the King's Champion also gets her hands on their 
naval defense plans." He took a breath, keeping his voice disinterested. "I 
want to present the idea to the king this morning. And I want you to support 
me." 

Because Dorian would never agree to it, not without knowing what 
Celaena was. And Chaol would never tell anyone, Dorian included. But with 
an idea this drastic, he'd need as much political muscle as he could get. 

"An ambitious, ruthless plan." His father smiled. "And if I support this 
idea and convince my allies on the council to support it, too, then what can I 
expect in return?" From the way his eyes gleamed, his father already knew 
the answer. 

"Then I will go back to Anielle with you," Chaol said. "I will leave my 
position as Captain and ... return home." 

It wasn't his home, not anymore, but if it meant getting Celaena out of the 
country ... Wendlyn was the last stronghold of the Fae, and the one place in 
Erilea where she'd be truly safe. 

Whatever shred of hope he'd had for a future with her was gone. She still 
felt something for him, she'd admitted, but she would never trust him. She 
would always hate him for what he'd done. 

But he could do this for her. Even if he never saw her again, even if she 
abandoned her duties as King's Champion and stayed with the Fae in 
Wendlyn forever--as long as he knew that she was safe, that no one could 
hurt her ... He'd sell his soul again and again for that. 

His father's eyes gleamed with triumph. "Consider it done." 


Chapter 53 


When Celaena finished telling Dorian the story she'd told Chaol--albeit a 
much more limited version--he let out a long sigh and fell back onto his bed. 
"Tt sounds like something out of a book," he said, staring at the ceiling. She 
sat down on the other side of the bed. 

"Believe me, I thought I was going mad for a while." 

"So you actually opened a portal to another world? Using these 
Wyrdmarks?" 

She nodded. "You also knocked that creature aside like it was a leaf 
caught in a wind." Oh, she hadn't forgotten about that. Not for one moment 
had she forgotten what it meant for him to have such raw power. 

"That was dumb luck." She watched him, this kind, clever prince of hers. 
"T still can't control it." 

"Tn the tomb," she said, "there is someone who might ... offer you some 
advice on how to control it. Who might have some information about the kind 
of power you've inherited." Right then, though, she didn't exactly know how 
to explain Mort to him, so she just said, "Someday soon, you and I could go 
down there and meet him." 

"Is he--" 

"You'll see when we get there. Zf he deigns to speak to you. It might take a 
while for him to decide he likes you." 

After a moment, Dorian reached over and took her hand, bringing it to his 
lips for a swift kiss. Nothing romantic--a gesture of thanks. "Even though 
things are different between us now, I meant what I said after the duel with 
Cain. I will always be grateful that you came into my life." 

Her throat tightened, and she squeezed his hand. 

Nehemia had dreamed of a court that could change the world, a court 
where loyalty and honor were more valued than blind obedience and power. 
The day Nehemia had died, Celaena had thought the dream of that court 
forever vanished. 

But looking at Dorian as he smiled at her, this prince who was smart and 
thoughtful and kind, who inspired good men like Chaol to serve him ... 


Celaena wondered if Nehemia's impossible, desperate dream of that court 
might yet come to pass. 

The real question now was whether his father knew what a threat his son 
posed. 


The King of Adarlan had to give the captain credit; the plan was ruthless and 
bold, and would send a message not just to Wendlyn, but to all their enemies. 
With the embargo between their countries, Wendlyn refused to let Adarlanian 
men into their borders. But women and children seeking refuge could still 
enter. It made sending anyone else impossible, but his Champion ... 

The king looked down his council table, where the captain was waiting 
for his decision. Westfall's father and four others had immediately supported 
the idea. Another bit of unexpected cunning from the captain. He'd brought 
allies to this meeting. 

Dorian, however, was watching the captain with barely concealed 
surprise. Clearly, Westfall hadn't thought Dorian would support his decision. 
If only Westfall had been his heir instead; his warrior's mind was sharp, and 
he didn't balk from doing what needed to be done. The prince had yet to 
learn that kind of ruthlessness. 

Getting the assassin away from his son would be an unexpected benefit. 
He trusted the girl to do his dirty work--but he didn't want her around 
Dorian. 

She'd brought Archer Finn's head to him this morning, not a day later than 
she'd promised him, and explained what she'd discovered: that Archer had 
been responsible for Nehemia's assassination due to their mutual 
involvement in that traitorous society. He wasn't surprised that Nehemia was 
involved. 

But what would the assassin have to say about this journey? 

"Summon my Champion," he said. In the ensuing silence, the council 
members murmured to each other, and his son tried to catch Westfall's eye. 
But the captain avoided looking at the prince. 

The king smiled slightly, twisting the black ring on his finger. A pity 
Perrington wasn't here to see this. He was off dealing with the slave uprising 
in Calaculla--news of which had been kept so secret that even the 
messengers had forfeited their lives. The duke would have been greatly 


amused by today's turn of events. But he wished Perrington here for more 
important reasons, too--to help him find out who had opened a portal last 
night. 

He'd sensed it in his sleep--a sudden shift in the world. It was open for 
only a few minutes before someone closed it again. Cain was gone; who else 
in this castle possessed that kind of knowledge, or that power in the blood? 
Was it the same person who had killed Baba Yellowlegs? 

He put a hand on Nothung, his sword. 

There had been no body--but he didn't think for one moment that 
Yellowlegs had just disappeared. The morning after she'd vanished, he'd 
gone to the carnival himself to look at the ruined wagon. He'd seen the flecks 
of dark blood staining the wooden floor. 

Yellowlegs had been a queen among her people, one of the three brutal 
factions that had destroyed the Crochan family five hundred years ago. 
They'd relished erasing much of the wisdom of the Crochan women who had 
ruled justly for a thousand years. He'd invited the carnival here to meet with 
her--to purchase a few of her mirrors, and learn what remained of the 
Ironteeth Alliance that had once been strong enough to rip apart the Witch 
Kingdom. 

But before she had yielded any decent information, she had died. And it 
frustrated him not to know why. Her blood had been spilled at his castle; 
others might come to demand answers and retribution. If they came, he would 
be ready. 

Because in the shadows of the Ferian Gap, he'd been breeding new 
mounts for his gathering armies. And his wyverns still needed riders. 

The doors to the council room opened. The assassin walked in, shoulders 
thrown back in that insufferable way of hers. She coolly took in the details of 
the room before stopping a few feet away from the table and bowing low. 
"Your Majesty summoned me?" 

She kept her eyes averted, as she usually did. Except for that delightful 
day when she'd come in and practically flayed Mullison alive. Part of him 
wished he didn't now have to free the sniveling councilman from the 
dungeons. 

"Your companion, Captain Westfall, has come up with a rather ... unusual 
idea," the king said, and waved a hand at Chaol. "Why don't you explain, 
Captain?" 


The Captain twisted in his chair, then rose to his feet to face her. "I have 
suggested that we send you to Wendlyn to dispatch the king and his heir. 
While you are there, you will also seize their naval and military defense 
plans--so that once the country is in chaos, we will be able to navigate their 
impenetrable barrier reefs and take the country for ourselves." 

The assassin looked at him for a long moment, and the king noticed that 
his son had gone very, very still. Then she smiled, a cruel, twisted thing. "It 
would be an honor to serve the crown in such a way." 

He had never learned anything about the mark that had glowed on her head 
during the duel. The Wyrdmark was impossible to decipher. It either meant 
"nameless" or "unnamed," or something akin to "anonymous." But gods- 
blessed or not, from the wicked grin on her face, the king knew she'd enjoy 
this task. 

"Perhaps we'll have some fun with it," the king mused. "Wendlyn is 
having their Solstice ball in a few months. What a message it would send if 
the king and his son were to meet their end right under the noses of their own 
court, on their day of triumph." 

Though the captain shifted on his feet at the sudden change of plans, the 
assassin smiled at him again, dark glee written all over her. What hellhole 
had she come from, to find delight in such things? "A brilliant idea, Your 
Majesty." 

"Its done, then," the king said, and they all looked at him. "You'll leave 
tomorrow." 

"But," his son interrupted, "surely she needs some time to study Wendlyn, 
to learn its ways and--" 

"Its a two-week journey by sea," he said. "And then she'll need time to 
infiltrate the castle in time for the ball. She can take whatever materials she 
needs and study them onboard." 

Her brows had lifted slightly, but she just bowed her head. The captain 
was still standing, stiffer than usual. And his son was glaring--glaring at him 
and at the captain, so angry that he wondered whether he'd snap. 

But the king wasn't particularly interested in their petty dramas, not when 
this brilliant plan had arisen. He'd have to send riders immediately to the 
Ferian Gap and the Dead Islands, and have General Narrok ready his legion. 
He didn't mean to make mistakes with this one chance in Wendlyn. 


And it would be the perfect opportunity to test a few of the weapons he'd 
been forging in secret all these years. 


Tomorrow. 

She was leaving tomorrow. 

And Chaol had come up with the idea? But why? She wanted to demand 
answers, wanted to know what he was thinking when he'd come up with this 
plan. She'd never told him the truth about the king's threats--that he would 
execute Chaol if she didn't return from a mission, if she failed. And she 
could fake the deaths of petty lords and merchants, but not the King and 
Crown Prince of Wendlyn. Not in a thousand lifetimes could she find a way 
out of it. 

She paced and paced, knowing Chaol wouldn't be back in his rooms yet, 
and wound up going down to the tomb, if only to give herself something to 
do. 

She expected Mort to lecture her about the portal--which he did, 
thoroughly--but she didn't expect to find Elena waiting for her inside the 
tomb. "You have enough power to appear to me now, but you couldn't help 
close the portal last night?" 

She took one look at the queen's frown and began pacing again. 

"I could not," Elena said. "Even now, this visit is draining me faster than 
it should." 

Celaena scowled at her. "I can't go to Wendlyn. I--I cant go. Chaol 
knows what I'm doing for you--so why would he make me go there?" 

"Take a breath," Elena said softly. 

Celaena glared at her. "This ruins your plans, too. If ''m in Wendlyn, then 
I can't deal with the Wyrdkeys and the king. And even if I pretended to go 
and instead went questing across this continent, it wouldn't take long for the 
king to realize I'm not where I'm supposed to be." 

Elena crossed her arms. "If you are in Wendlyn, then you will be near 
Doranelle. I think that's why the captain wants you to go." 

Celaena barked a laugh. Oh, what a tangled mess he'd gotten her into! "He 
wants me to go hide with the Fae and never come back to Adarlan? That's 
not going to happen. Not only will he be killed, but the Wyrdkeys--" 


"You will sail to Wendlyn tomorrow." Elena's eyes glowed bright. 
"Leave the Wyrdkeys and the king for now. Go to Wendlyn, and do what 
needs to be done." 

"Did you plant this idea in his head somehow?" 

"No. The captain is trying to save you the only way he knows how." 

Celaena shook her head, looking at the sunlight pouring into the tomb from 
the shaft above. "Will you ever stop giving me commands?" 

Elena let out a soft laugh. "When you stop running from your past, I will." 

Celaena rolled her eyes, then let her shoulders droop. A shard of memory 
sliced through her. "When I spoke to Nehemia, she mentioned ... mentioned 
that she knew her own fate. That she had embraced it. That it would set things 
in motion. Do you think she somehow manipulated Archer into ..." But she 
couldn't finish saying it, couldn't let herself voice what the horrible truth 
might be: that Nehemia had engineered her own death, knowing that she might 
change the world--change Ce/aena--more through dying than living. 

A cold, slender hand grasped hers. "Cast that thought into the far reaches 
of your mind. Knowing the truth, whatever it may be, will not change what 
you must do tomorrow--where you must go." 

And even though Celaena knew the truth in that moment, knew it just from 
Elena's refusal to answer at all, she did as the queen commanded. There 
would be other moments, other times to take out that truth to examine every 
dark and unforgiving facet. But right now--right now ... 

Celaena studied the light pouring into the tomb. Such a little light, holding 
the darkness at bay. ""Wendlyn, then." 

Elena smiled grimly and squeezed her hand. ""Wendlyn, then." 


Chapter 54 


When the council meeting was over, Chaol did his best not to look at his 
father, who had been watching him so carefully while he'd announced his 
plans to the king, or at Dorian, whose sense of betrayal rippled off of him as 
the meeting went on. He tried to hurry back to the barracks, but he wasn't all 
that surprised when a hand clapped on his shoulder and turned him around. 

"Wendlyn?" Dorian snarled. 

Chaol kept his face blank. "If she's capable of opening a portal like she 
did last night, then I think she needs to get out of the castle for a while. For 
all of our sakes." Dorian couldn't know the truth. 

"She'll never forgive you for having her shipped off like that, to take 
down a whole country. And in such a public way--making a spectacle out of 
it. Are you mad?" 

"I don't need her forgiveness. And I don't want to worry about her letting 
in a horde of otherwordly creatures just because she's missing her friend." 

He hated each lie that came out of his mouth, but Dorian drank them up, 
his eyes seeming to glow with rage. This was the other sacrifice he'd have to 
make; because if Dorian didn't hate him, if he didn't want Chaol gone, then 
leaving for Anielle would be that much more difficult. 

"Tf anything happens to her in Wendlyn," Dorian growled, refusing to back 
down, "T I1 make you regret the day you were born." 

If anything happened to her, Chaol was fairly certain he'd forever regret 
that day, too. 

But he just said, "One of us has to start leading, Dorian," and stalked off. 

Dorian didn't follow him. 


Dawn was just breaking as Celaena arrived at Nehemia's grave. The last of 
the winter snows had melted, leaving the world barren and brown, waiting 
for spring. 

In a few hours, she'd set sail across the ocean. 

Celaena dropped to her knees on the damp ground and bowed her head 
before the grave. 


Then she said the words she'd wanted to say to Nehemia last night. The 
words that she should have said from the beginning. Words that wouldn't 
change, no matter what she learned about Nehemia's death. 

"T want you to know," she whispered to the wind, to the earth, to the body 
far beneath her, "that you were right. You were right. I am a coward. And I 
have been running for so long that I' ve forgotten what it is to stand and fight." 

She bowed deeper, putting her forehead against the dirt. 

"But I promise," she breathed into the soil, "I promise that I will stop him. 
I promise that I will never forgive, never forget what they did to you. I 
promise that I will free Eyllwe. I promise that I will see your father's crown 
restored to his head." 

She raised herself, drawing a dagger from her pocket, and sliced a line 
across her left palm. Blood welled, ruby-bright against the golden dawn, 
sliding down the side of her hand before she pressed her palm to the earth. 

"I promise," she whispered again. "On my name, on my life, even if it 
takes until my last breath, I promise I will see Eyllwe freed." 

She let her blood soak into the ground, willing it to carry the words of her 
oath to the Otherworld where Nehemia was safe at last. From now on, there 
would be no other oaths but this, no other contracts, no other obligations. 
Never forgive, never forget. 

And she didn't know how she would do it, or how long it would take, but 
she would see it through. Because Nehemia couldn't. 

Because it was time. 


Chapter 55 


The shattered lock on Celaena's bedroom door still wasn't fixed by the time 
Dorian appeared after breakfast, a stack of books in his arms. She stood 
before her bed, stuffing clothing into a large leather satchel. Fleetfoot was the 
first to acknowledge him, though he had no doubt Celaena heard him coming 
from the hallway. 

The dog limped to him, tail wagging, and Dorian set the books on the desk 
before kneeling on the plush rug. He ran his hands over Fleetfoot's head, 
letting her lick hima few times. 

"The healer said her leg is going to be fine," Celaena said, still focused 
on her satchel. Her left hand was bandaged--a wound he hadn't noticed last 
night. "She just left a few minutes ago." 

"Good," Dorian said, rising to his feet. She was wearing a heavy tunic 
and pants and a thick cloak. Her brown boots were sturdy and sensible, far 
more subdued than her usual attire. Traveling clothes. "Were you going to 
leave without saying good-bye?" 

"T thought it would be easier this way," she said. In two hours, she would 
sail to Wendlyn, that land of myths and monsters, a kingdom of dreams and 
nightmares made flesh. 

Dorian approached her. "This plan is madness. You don't have to go. We 
can convince my father to do something else. If they catch you in Wendlyn--" 

"They won't catch me." 

"There will be no help for you," Dorian said, putting a hand on the 
satchel. "If you are captured, if you are hurt, you are beyond our reach. You 
will be entirely on your own." 

"PI be fine." 

"But J won't be. Every day that you're there, I will wonder what has 
become of you. I won't ... I won't forget you. Not for one hour." 

Her throat bobbed, the only sign of emotion she allowed to show, and she 
looked toward her dog, watching them from the rug. "Will you ..." He 
watched her swallow again before meeting his gaze. The gold in her eyes 
glowed in the morning sun. "Will you look after her while I'm gone?" 


He took her hand, squeezing. "As if she's one of my own. Pl even let her 
sleep in the bed." 

She gave him a small smile, and he had a feeling that any greater sign of 
emotion would shatter her self-control. He waved a hand to the books he'd 
brought. "I hope you don't mind, but I need a place to store these, and your 
rooms might be ... safer than mine." 

She glanced at the desk but, to his relief, didn't go to it. The books he'd 
brought would only lead to more questions. Geneaologies, royal chronicles, 
anything on how and why he might have magic. "Of course," was all she 
said. "I think The Walking Dead is still floating around in here, anyway. 
Maybe it'll be glad to have company." 

He might have smiled had it not been eerily true. "P11 leave you to your 
packing. I have a council meeting at the same time your ship departs," he 
said, fighting the ache in his chest. It was a lie--and a bad one. But he didn't 
want to be at the docks, not when he knew someone else would be there to 
see her off. "So ... I suppose this is good-bye." He didn't know whether he 
was allowed to embrace her anymore, so he stuffed his hands into his 
pockets and gave her a smile. "Take care of yourself." 

A faint nod. 

They were friends now, and he knew that the physical boundaries between 
them had been altered, but ... He turned away rather than let her see the 
disappointment he knew was all too clear on his face. 

He took all of two steps toward the door before she spoke, the words soft 
and strained. "Thank you for all that you have done for me, Dorian. Thank 
you for being my friend. For not being like the others." 

He paused, turning to face her. She kept her chin high, but her eyes were 
gleaming. 

"PII come back," she said quietly. "TP 11 come back for you." And he knew 
that there was more that she wasn't saying, some bigger meaning behind 
those words. 

But Dorian still believed her. 


The docks were crowded with sailors and slaves and workers loading and 
unloading cargo. The day was warm and breezy, the first hint of spring in the 
air, and the sky was cloudless. A good day for sailing. 


Celaena stood before the ship that would carry her through the first leg of 
the journey. It would sail to a prearranged location where a ship from 
Wendlyn would meet it to take aboard refugees fleeing the shadow of 
Adarlan's empire. Most of the women traveling on her ship were already 
belowdecks. She shifted the fingers of her bandaged left hand, wincing at the 
dull pain radiating outward from her palm. 

She had hardly slept that night, holding Fleetfoot close to her instead. 
Saying good-bye an hour ago had been like ripping out a piece of her heart, 
but the dog's leg was still too injured for her to risk the journey to Wendlyn. 

She hadn't wanted to see Chaol, hadn't bothered saying good-bye, 
because she had so many questions for him that it was easier not to ask at all. 
Hadn't he known what an impossible trap he was setting for her now? 

The ship captain bellowed a five-minute departure warning. The sailors 
started scrambling, doubling their efforts to prepare to leave the harbor and 
set out down the Avery, and then into the Great Ocean itself. 

To Wendlyn. 

She swallowed hard. Do what needs to be done, Elena had told her. Did 
that mean actually killing the royal family of Wendlyn, or something else? 

A salty breeze ruffled her hair, and she stepped forward. 

But someone emerged from the shadows of the buildings lining the docks. 

"Wait," Chaol said. 

Celaena froze as he walked to her, and didn't move even when she found 
herself looking up into his face. 

"Do you understand why I did this?" he asked softly. 

She nodded, but said, "I have to return here." 

"No," he said, his eyes flashing. "You--" 

"Listen." 

She had five minutes. She couldn't explain it to him now--couldn't 
explain that the king would kill him if she didn't return. That knowledge 
could be fatal to him. And even if he ran away, the king had threatened 
Nehemia's family, too. 

But she knew that Chaol was trying to protect her. And she couldn't leave 
him wholly ignorant. Because if she did die in Wendlyn, if something 
happened to her ... 

"Listen carefully to what I am about to tell you." 


His brows rose. But she didn't give herself a moment to reconsider, to 
second-guess her decision. 

As succinctly as she could, she told him about the Wyrdkeys. She told him 
about the Wyrdgates, and about Baba Yellowlegs. She told him about the 
papers she'd stashed down in the tomb--the riddle with the locations of the 
three Wyrdkeys. And then she told him that she knew the king had at least 
one. And that there was a dead creature sealed beneath the library. And that 
he should never open the door to the catacombs--never. And that Roland and 
Kaltain might be part of some bigger, deadlier plan. 

And when that horrible truth had been revealed, she unfastened the Eye of 
Elena from her neck and folded it into his palm. "Never take it off. It will 
protect you from harm." 

He was shaking his head, his face deathly pale. "Celaena, I can't--" 

"I don't care if you go looking for the keys, but someone has to know 
about them. Someone other than me. All the proof is in the tomb." 

Chaol grabbed her hand with his free one. "Celaena--" 

"Listen," she repeated. "If you hadn't convinced the king to send me 
away, we could have ... figured them out together. But now ..." 

Two minutes, the sea captain shouted. Chaol was just staring at her, such 
grief and fear in his eyes that speech failed her. 

And then she did the most reckless thing she'd ever done in her life. She 
stood on her toes and whispered the words into his ear. 

The words that would make him understand, understand why it was so 
important to her, and what it meant when she said she would return. And he 
would hate her forever for it, once he understood. 

"What does that mean?" he demanded. 

She smiled sadly. "You'll figure it out. And when you do ..." She shook 
her head, knowing she shouldn't say it, but doing it anyway. "When you do, I 
want you to remember that it wouldn't have made any difference to me. It's 
never made any difference to me when it came to you. I'd still pick you. Pll 
always pick you." 

"Please--please, just tell me what that means." 

But there was no time, so she shook her head and stepped back. 

Chaol took one step toward her, though. One step, then he said, "I love 


99 


you. 


She strangled the sob that built in her throat. "I'm sorry," she said, hoping 
he would remember those words later--later, when he knew everything. 

Her legs found the strength to move. She took a breath. And with a final 
look at Chaol, she strode up the gangplank. Taking no notice of those 
onboard, she set down her sack and took up a place by the railing. She 
looked down at the dock to find Chaol still standing by the walkway as it 
was lifted. 

The ship's captain called for them to cast off. Sailors scurried, ropes 
were untied, tossed, and tied again, and the ship lurched. Her hands clasped 
the railing so hard they hurt. 

The ship began moving. And Chaol--the man she hated and loved so 
much that she could hardly think around him--yjust stood there, watching her 
go. 

The current grabbed the ship, and the city began to diminish. The ocean 
breeze soon caressed her neck, but she never stopped staring at Chaol. She 
stared toward him until the glass castle was a sparkling speck in the distance. 
She stared toward him until there was only gleaming ocean around her. She 
stared toward him until the sun dropped beyond the horizon and a smattering 
of stars hung overhead. 

It was only when her eyelids drooped and she swayed on her feet that 
Celaena stopped staring toward Chaol. 

The smell of salt filled her nostrils, so different from the salt of Endovier, 
and a spirited wind whipped through her hair. 

With a hiss through her teeth, Celaena Sardothien turned her back on 
Adarlan and sailed toward Wendlyn. 


Chapter 56 


Chaol didn't understand what she'd told him, the words she'd whispered in 
his ear. It was a date. Not even a year attached to it. A month and a day--a 
date that had passed weeks and weeks ago. It was the day that Celaena had 
left the city. The day she had snapped at Endovier a year before. The day her 
parents had died. 

He stayed on the docks long after the ship was out of the harbor, watching 
its sails become smaller and smaller as he mulled over the date again and 
again. Why had she told him everything about those--those Wyrdkeys, but 
made this hint so obscure? What could possibly be more important than the 
horrible truth about the king he served? 

The Wyrdkeys, while they terrified him, made sense. They explained so 
much. The king's great power, his journeys that ended with the whole party 
mysteriously dying, how Cain had become so strong. Even that time Chaol 
had looked at Perrington and seen his eyes darken so strangely. But when 
she'd told him, had she known what kind of choice she'd left him? And what 
could he possibly do about it from Anielle? 

Unless he could find a way out of the vow he'd made. He'd never said 
when he would go to Anielle. He could think about that tomorrow. For now 


When Chaol returned to the castle, he went to her rooms, sorting through 
the contents of her desk. But there was nothing about that date. He checked 
the will she'd written, but that had been signed several days after. The 
silence and emptiness of her chambers threatened to swallow him whole, and 
he was about to leave when he spotted the stack of books half hidden in the 
shadows of her desk. 

Geneaologies and countless royal chronicles. When had she brought these 
books here? He hadn't seen them the other mght. Was it somehow another 
clue? Standing before the desk, he pulled out the royal chronicles--all from 
the the past eighteen years--and started back, one by one. Nothing. 

Then came the chronicle from ten years ago. It was thicker than all the rest 
--as it should be, given the events that had happened that year. But when he 
saw what was written about the date she had given, everything froze. 


This morning, King Orlon Galathynius, his nephew and heir, 
Rhoe Galathynius, and Rhoes wife, Evalin, were found 
assassinated. Orlon was murdered in his bed at the royal palace 
in Orynth, and Rhoe and Evalin were found dead in their beds at 
their country estate along the River Florine. There is no word 
yet about the fate of Rhoe and Evalins daughter, Aelin. 


Chaol grabbed for the first geneaology book, the one on the bloodlines of 
the royal houses of Adarlan and Terrasen. Was Celaena trying to tell him she 
knew the truth about what had happened that night--that she might know 
where the lost princess Aelin was hiding? That she had been there when this 
all happened? 

He flipped through the pages, scanning the genealogies he had already 
read. But then he remembered something about the name Evalin Ashryver. 
Ashryver. 

Evalin had come from Wendlyn, had been a princess of the king's court. 
Hands shaking, he yanked out a book containing Wendlyn's royal family tree. 

On the last page, Aelin Ashryver Galathynius's name was written at the 
bottom, and above it, her mother, Evalin's. But the family tree traced only the 
female line. The female, not the male, because-- 

Two spots above Evalin's name was written Mab. Aelin's great- 
grandmother. She was one of the three Fae Sister-Queens: Maeve, Mora, and 
Mab. Mab, the youngest, the fairest, who, when she died, had been made into 
a goddess, known to them now as Deanna, Lady of the Hunt. 

The memory hit him like a brick to the face. That Yulemas morning, when 
Celaena had looked so uncomfortable to be receiving the golden arrow of 
Deanna--the arrow of Mab. 

And Chaol counted down the family tree, one after one, until-- 

My great-grandmother was Fae. 

Chaol had to brace a hand against the desk. No, it couldn't be. He turned 
back to the chronicle still lying open, and turned to the next day. 


Aelin Galathynius, heir to the throne of Terrasen, died today, or 
sometime in the night. Before help could reach her deceased 
parents' estate, the assassin who had missed her the night 


before returned. Her body has still not been found, though some 
believe it was thrown into the river behind her parents' house. 


She'd once said that Arobynn had ... had found her. Found her half-dead 
and frozen. On a riverbank. 

He was just jumping to conclusions. Maybe she merely wanted him to 
know that she still cared about Terrasen, or-- 

There was a poem scribbled at the top of the Ashryver family tree, as 
though some student had dashed it down it as a reminder while studying. 


Ashryver Eyes 
The fairest eyes, from legends old 
Of brightest blue, ringed with gold. 


Bright blue eyes, ringed with gold. A strangled cry came out of him. How 
many times had he looked into those eyes? How many times had he seen her 
avert her gaze, that one bit of proof she couldn't hide, from the king? 


Celaena Sardothien wasn't in league with Aelin Ashryver Galathynius. 

Celaena Sardothien was Aelin Ashryver Galathynius, heir to the throne 
and rightful Queen of Terrasen. 

Celaena was Aelin Galathynius, the greatest living threat to Adarlan, the 
one person who could raise an army capable of standing against the king. 
Now, she was also the one person who knew the secret source of the king's 
power--and who sought a way to destroy it. 

And he had just sent her into the arms of her strongest potential allies: to 
the homeland of her mother, the kingdom of her cousin, and the domain of her 
aunt, Queen Maeve of the Fae. 

Celaena was the lost Queen of Terrasen. 

Chaol sank to his knees.
